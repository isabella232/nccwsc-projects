Understanding the climate-induced vulnerability of land-to-ocean movement of freshwater due to glacier melting is critical since the variability in glacier runoff is much larger than that for other components of the water cycle.&nbsp; This project will develop methods to quantify runoff from watersheds along the Gulf of Alaska, allowing an assessment of impacts on coastal ecosystems. This study will also assess available data, develop an interdisciplinary conceptual model, and disseminate findings to both scientific peers and the public, paving the way forward to a better understanding of one of the least understood regional water cycles on Earth. New information from this study will provide a framework for assessing the future evolution of glacier discharge into the Gulf of Alaska, reducing uncertainty in determining the response of coastal ecosystems to a changing climate.

Alaska glaciers","body":"Abstract:&nbsp;We present a high-resolution Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mascon solution for Gulf of Alaska (GOA) glaciers and compare this with in situ glaciological, climate and other remote-sensing observations. Our GRACE solution yields a GOA glacier mass balance of - 65 &plusmn; 11 Gt a - 1 for the period December 2003 to December 2010, with summer balances driving the interannual variability. Between October\/November 2003 and October 2009 we obtain a mass balance of - 61 &plusmn; 11 Gt a - 1 from GRACE, which compares well with - 65 &plusmn; 12 Gt a - 1 from ICESat based on hypsometric extrapolation of glacier elevation changes. We find that mean summer (June - August) air temperatures derived from both ground and lower-troposphere temperature records were good predictors of GRACE-derived summer mass balances, capturing 59% and 72% of the summer balance variability respectively. Large mass losses during 2009 were likely due to low early melt season surface albedos, measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and likely associated with the 31 March 2009 eruption of Mount Redoubt, southwestern Alaska. GRACE data compared well with in situ measurements at Wolverine Glacier (maritime Alaska), but poorly with those at Gulkana Glacier (interior Alaska). We conclude that, although GOA mass estimates from GRACE are robust over the entire domain, further constraints on subregional and seasonal estimates are necessary to improve fidelity to ground observations.","parentId":"50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2","contacts":[{"name":"Anthony Arendt","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Alaska Fairbanks"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Scott Luthcke","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"NASA Goddard Space Flight Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alex Gardner","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Clark University & University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Shad O'Neel","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"US Geological Survey, Anchorage"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"David Hill","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Oregon State University, Corvallis"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Geir Moholdt","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Scripps Institution of Oceanography"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Waleed Abdalati","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Colorado, Boulder"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alaska CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/igsoc\/jog\/2013\/00000059\/00000217\/art00010","title":"Abstract","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"glaciers"},{"name":"Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)"},{"name":"Gulf of Alaska"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013-09","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-01-01T17:01:58.972-07:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-21T14:29:56.607-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2013","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-01-01T17:01:58.972-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-21T14:29:56.607-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Journal of Glaciology","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI Number","value":"doi: 10.3189\/2013JoG12J197"}],"edition":"Volume 59 number 217 pages 913 - 924","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Alaska CSC","parent_id":"4f831626e4b0e84f6086809b","people":["Anthony Arendt","Scott Luthcke","Alex Gardner","Shad O'Neel","David Hill","Geir Moholdt","Waleed Abdalati"],"orgs":["Alaska CSC"],"children":[]},"5303d230e4b0c8fd19b8a283":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/50461941e4b0241d49d62bab","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Assessing streamflow sensitivity to variations in glacier mass balance","relatedTitle":"Assessing the Sensitivity of Alaska\u2019s Coastal Rainforest Ecosystem to Changes in Glacier Runoff","id":"5303d230e4b0c8fd19b8a283","relatedId":"50461941e4b0241d49d62bab","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5303d230e4b0c8fd19b8a283","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Assessing the Sensitivity of Alaska\u2019s Coastal Rainforest Ecosystem to Changes in Glacier Runoff","relatedTitle":"Assessing streamflow sensitivity to variations in glacier mass balance","id":"50461941e4b0241d49d62bab","relatedId":"5303d230e4b0c8fd19b8a283","annotation":null}]},"id":"5303d230e4b0c8fd19b8a283","title":"Assessing streamflow sensitivity to variations in glacier mass balance","body":"Abstract:&nbsp;We examine long-term streamflow and mass balance data from two Alaskan glaciers located in climatically distinct basins: Gulkana Glacier, a continental glacier located in the Alaska Range, and Wolverine Glacier, a maritime glacier located in the Kenai Mountains. Over the 1966\u20132011 study interval, both glaciers lost mass, primarily as a result of summer warming, and streamflow increased in both basins. We estimate total glacier runoff via summer mass balance and quantify the fraction of runoff related to annual mass imbalances. In both climates, annual (net) mass balance contributes, on average, less than 20 % of total streamflow, substantially less than the fraction related to summer mass loss (&gt;50 %), which occurs even in years of glacier growth. The streamflow fraction related to changes in annual balance increased significantly only in the continental environment. In the maritime climate, where deep winter snowpacks and frequent rain events drive consistently high runoff, the magnitude of this streamflow fraction was small and highly variable, precluding detection of any existing trend. Furthermore, our findings suggest that glacier mass change is likely to impact total basin water yield, timing of runoff and water quality in the continental environment. However, the impacts of maritime glacier change appear more likely to be limited to water quality and runoff timing.","parentId":"50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2","contacts":[{"name":"Shad O\u2019Neel","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"US Geological Survey Alaska Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Eran Hood","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Alaska Southeast"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Anthony Arendt","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Alaska Fairbanks"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Louis Sass","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"US Geological Survey Alaska Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alaska CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10584-013-1042-7\/fulltext.html","title":"O'Neel et al., 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"streamflow"},{"name":"mass balance"},{"name":"Gulkana Glacier"},{"name":"Alaska Range"},{"name":"Wolverine Glacier"},{"name":"Kenai Mountains"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013-12","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-02-18T14:35:44.474-07:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-15T14:29:22.449-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2013","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-02-18T14:35:44.474-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-15T14:29:22.449-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Climatic Change","edition":"March 2014, Volume 123, Issue 2, pp 329-341","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Alaska CSC","parent_id":"4f831626e4b0e84f6086809b","people":["Shad O\u2019Neel","Eran Hood","Anthony Arendt","Louis Sass"],"orgs":["Alaska CSC"],"children":[]},"51dc4f1ee4b097e4d3836728":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/50461941e4b0241d49d62bab","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Calving seismicity from iceberg\u2013sea surface interactions","relatedTitle":"Assessing the Sensitivity of Alaska\u2019s Coastal Rainforest Ecosystem to Changes in Glacier Runoff","id":"51dc4f1ee4b097e4d3836728","relatedId":"50461941e4b0241d49d62bab","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/51dc4f1ee4b097e4d3836728","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Assessing the Sensitivity of Alaska\u2019s Coastal Rainforest Ecosystem to Changes in Glacier Runoff","relatedTitle":"Calving seismicity from iceberg\u2013sea surface interactions","id":"50461941e4b0241d49d62bab","relatedId":"51dc4f1ee4b097e4d3836728","annotation":null}]},"id":"51dc4f1ee4b097e4d3836728","title":"Calving seismicity from iceberg\u2013sea surface interactions","body":"This publication is a product from the 2011 Alaska CSC supported project \"Assessing the Sensitivity of Alaska\u2019s Coastal Rainforest Ecosystems to Changes in Glacier Runoff\". Abstract from paper:&nbsp; Iceberg calving is known to release substantial seismic energy, but little is known about \n<div>\n the specific mechanisms that produce calving icequakes. At Yahtse Glacier, a tidewater&nbsp; glacier on the Gulf of Alaska, we draw upon a local network of seismometers and focus on&nbsp; 80 hours of concurrent, direct observation of the terminus to show that calving is the&nbsp; dominant source of seismicity. To elucidate seismogenic mechanisms, we synchronized&nbsp; video and seismograms to reveal that the majority of seismic energy is produced during&nbsp; iceberg interactions with the sea surface. Icequake peak amplitudes coincide with the&nbsp; emergence of high velocity jets of water and ice from the fjord after the complete&nbsp; submergence of falling icebergs below sea level. These icequakes have dominant&nbsp; frequencies between 1 and 3 Hz. Detachment of an iceberg from the terminus produces&nbsp; comparatively weak seismic waves at frequencies between 5 and 20 Hz. Our observations&nbsp; allow us to suggest that the most powerful sources of calving icequakes at Yahtse Glacier&nbsp; include iceberg-sea surface impact, deceleration under the influence of drag and buoyancy,&nbsp; and cavitation. Numerical simulations of seismogenesis during iceberg-sea surface&nbsp; interactions support our observational evidence. Our new understanding of iceberg-sea&nbsp; surface interactions allows us to reattribute the sources of calving seismicity identified in&nbsp; earlier studies and offer guidance for the future use of seismology in monitoring iceberg&nbsp; calving.\n<\/div>","parentId":"50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2","contacts":[{"name":"Alaska CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Timothy C.

The extent to which these warm waters affect the mass balance of Alaskan tidewater glaciers is uncertain. Here we report hydrographic measurements made within Icy Bay, Alaska, and calculate rates of submarine melt at Yahtse Glacier, a tidewater glacier terminating in Icy Bay. We find strongly stratified water properties consistent with estuarine circulation and evidence that warm Gulf of Alaska water reaches the head of 40 km - long Icy Bay, largely unaltered. A 10 - 20 m layer of cold, fresh, glacially-modified water overlies warm, saline water. The saline water is observed to reach up to 10.4 &deg;C within 1.5 km of the terminus of Yahtse Glacier. By quantifying the heat and salt deficit within the glacially-modified water, we place bounds on the rate of submarine melt. The submarine melt rate is estimated at &gt;9 m d-1, at least half the rate at which ice flows into the terminus region, and can plausibly account for all of the submarine terminus mass loss. Our measurements suggest that summer and fall subaerial calving is a direct response to thermal undercutting of the terminus, further demonstrating the critical role of the ocean in modulating tidewater glacier dynamics.","parentId":"50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2","contacts":[{"name":"Shad R O'Neel","oldPartyId":7621,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"soneel@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Glaciologist","firstName":"Shad","middleName":"R","lastName":"O'Neel","organization":{"displayText":"Alaska Integrated Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9077867150","streetAddress":{"zip":"99508-4626","city":"Anchorage","line1":"4210 University Drive,"},"buildingCode":"WAW","name":"Shad R O'Neel\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"99508-4626","country":"USA","city":"Anchorage","state":"AK","line1":"4210 University Drive"},"building":"Gould Hall"}},{"name":"Timothy C.

Characterizing DOC in Mendenhall Glacier outflow (southeast Alaska) we document a seasonal persistence to the radiocarbon-depleted signature of DOC, highlighting ancient DOC as a ubiquitous feature of glacier outflow. We observed no systematic depletion in&nbsp; \n<em>\u0394<\/em> &nbsp; 14 C-DOC with increasing discharge during the melt season that would suggest mobilization of an aged subglacial carbon store. However, DOC concentration,&nbsp; \n<em>\u03b4<\/em> &nbsp; 13 C-DOC,&nbsp; \n<em>\u0394<\/em> &nbsp; 14 C-DOC and fluorescence signatures appear to have been influenced by runoff from vegetated hillslopes above the glacier during onset and senescence of melt. In the peak glacier melt period, the&nbsp; \n<em>\u0394<\/em> &nbsp; 14 C-DOC of stream samples at the outflow (-181.7 to - 355.3\u2030) was comparable to the&nbsp; \n<em>\u0394<\/em> &nbsp; 14 C-DOC for snow samples from the accumulation zone (\u2212207.2 to \u2212390.9\u2030), suggesting that ancient DOC from the glacier surface is exported in glacier runoff. The pre-aged DOC in glacier snow and runoff is consistent with contributions from fossil fuel combustion sources similar to those documented previously in ice cores and thus provides evidence for anthropogenic perturbation of the carbon cycle. Overall, our results emphasize the need to further characterize DOC inputs to glacier ecosystems, particularly in light of predicted changes in glacier mass and runoff in the coming century.","parentId":"50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2","linkParentIds":["5040dbe5e4b07a90c5ec1485"],"contacts":[{"name":"Robert G M Spencer","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Woods Hole Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Andrew Vermilyea","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Castleton State College"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jason Fellman","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Alaska Southeast"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Peter Raymond","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Yale University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Aron Stubbins","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Skidaway Institute of Oceanography"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Durelle Scott","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Virginia Tech"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Eran Hood","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Alaska Southeast"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alaska CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/1748-9326\/9\/5\/055005","title":"Spencer et al. 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Mendenhall Glacier"},{"name":"Dissolved organic carbon (DOC)"},{"name":"glacier ecosystems"},{"name":"Glacier Runoff"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-05-08","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-08-28T14:00:01.825-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-20T12:07:53.488-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2014","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-08-28T14:00:01.825-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-20T12:07:53.488-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Environmental Research Letters","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issn","value":"1748-9326"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"volume","value":"9"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issue","value":"5"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"startPage","value":"055005"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1088\/1748-9326\/9\/5\/055005"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"journal article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Alaska CSC","parent_id":"4f831626e4b0e84f6086809b","people":["Robert G M Spencer","Andrew Vermilyea","Jason Fellman","Peter Raymond","Aron Stubbins","Durelle Scott","Eran Hood"],"orgs":["Alaska CSC"],"children":[]},"556e0e41e4b0d9246a9f9a67":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/50461941e4b0241d49d62bab","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Spatial and temporal variability of freshwater discharge into the Gulf of Alaska","relatedTitle":"Assessing the Sensitivity of Alaska\u2019s Coastal Rainforest Ecosystem to Changes in Glacier Runoff","id":"556e0e41e4b0d9246a9f9a67","relatedId":"50461941e4b0241d49d62bab","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/556e0e41e4b0d9246a9f9a67","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Assessing the Sensitivity of Alaska\u2019s Coastal Rainforest Ecosystem to Changes in Glacier Runoff","relatedTitle":"Spatial and temporal variability of freshwater discharge into the Gulf of Alaska","id":"50461941e4b0241d49d62bab","relatedId":"556e0e41e4b0d9246a9f9a67","annotation":null}]},"id":"556e0e41e4b0d9246a9f9a67","title":"Spatial and temporal variability of freshwater discharge into the Gulf of Alaska","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/2014JC010395\/full):&nbsp;A study of the freshwater discharge into the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) has been carried out. Using available streamgage data, regression equations were developed for monthly flows. These equations express discharge as a function of basin physical characteristics such as area, mean elevation, and land cover, and of basin meteorological characteristics such as temperature, precipitation, and accumulated water year precipitation. To provide the necessary input meteorological data, temperature and precipitation data for a 40 year hind-cast period were developed on high-spatial-resolution grids using weather station data, PRISM climatologies, and statistical downscaling methods. Runoff predictions from the equations were found to agree well with observations. Once developed, the regression equations were applied to a network of delineated watersheds spanning the entire GOA drainage basin. The region was divided into a northern region, ranging from the Aleutian Chain to the Alaska\/Canada border in the southeast panhandle, and a southern region, ranging from there to the Fraser River. The mean annual runoff volume into the northern GOA region was found to be 792 &plusmn; 120 km3&nbsp;yr\u22121. A water balance using MODIS-based evapotranspiration rates yielded seasonal storage volumes that were consistent with GRACE satellite-based estimates. The GRACE data suggest that an additional 57 &plusmn; 11 km3&nbsp;yr\u22121&nbsp;be added to the runoff from the northern region, due to glacier volume loss (GVL) in recent years. This yields a total value of 849 &plusmn; 121 km3&nbsp;yr\u22121. The ease of application of the derived regression equations provides an accessible tool for quantifying mean annual values, seasonal variation, and interannual variability of runoff in any ungaged basin of interest.","parentId":"50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2","contacts":[{"name":"D.

However, the specific sources of glacier DOC remain unresolved. To assess the origin and nature of glacier DOC, we collected snow from 10 locations along a transect across the Juneau Icefield, Alaska extending from the coast toward the interior. The \u039414C-DOC of snow varied from \u2212743 to \u2212420\u2030 showing progressive depletion across the Icefield as \u03b418O of water became more depleted (R2&nbsp;= 0.56). Older DOC corresponded to lower DOC concentrations in snow ( \n<em>R<\/em>2&nbsp;= 0.31) and a decrease in percent humic-like fluorescence ( \n<em>R<\/em>2&nbsp;= 0.36), indicating an overall decrease in modern DOC across the Icefield. Carbon isotopic signatures (13C and&nbsp;14C) combined with a three-source mixing model showed that DOC deposited in snow across the Icefield reflects fossil fuel combustion products (43\u201373%) and to a lesser extent marine (21\u201341%) and terrestrial sources (1\u201326%). Our finding that combustion aerosols are a large source of DOC to the glacier ecosystem during the early spring (April\u2013May) together with the pronounced rates of glacier melting in the region suggests that the delivery of relic DOC to the ocean may be increasing and consequently impacting the biogeochemistry of glacial and proglacial ecosystems in unanticipated ways.","parentId":"50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2","contacts":[{"name":"Jason B.

We studied the seasonal variability and interaction between stream temperature and DO in a low-gradient, forested stream and a glacial-fed stream in coastal southeast Alaska to assess how these key physical parameters impact freshwater habitat quality for salmon. We also use multiple regression analysis to evaluate how discharge and air temperature influence the seasonal patterns in stream temperature and DO. Mean daily stream temperature ranged from 1.1 to 16.4&deg;C in non-glacial Peterson Creek but only 1.0 to 8.8&deg;C in glacial-fed Cowee Creek, reflecting the strong moderating influence glacier meltwater had on stream temperature. Peterson Creek had mean daily DO concentrations ranging from 3.8 to 14.1 mg L\u22121 suggesting future climate changes could result in an even greater depletion in DO. Mean daily stream temperature strongly controlled mean daily DO in both Peterson (R2=0.82, P&lt;0.01) and Cowee Creek (R2=0.93, P&lt;0.01). However, DO in Peterson Creek was mildly related to stream temperature (R2=0.15, P&lt;0.01) and strongly influenced by discharge (R2=0.46, P&lt;0.01) on days when stream temperature exceeded 10&deg;C. Moreover, Peterson Creek had DO values that were particularly low (&lt;5.0 mg L\u22121) on days when discharge was low but also when spawning salmon were abundant. Our results demonstrate the complexity of stream temperature and DO regimes in coastal temperate watersheds and highlight the need for watershed managers to move towards multi-factor risk assessment of potential habitat quality for salmon rather than single factor assessments alone.","parentId":"50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2","contacts":[{"name":"Jason B.

The nine watersheds have glacier coverage ranging from 0% to 63%. Our goal was to determine how air temperature and watershed land cover, particularly glacier coverage, influence stream temperature across the seasonal glacial meltwater hydrograph. Multiple linear regression models identified mean watershed elevation (related to glacier extent) and watershed lake coverage (%) as the strongest landscape controls on mean monthly stream temperature, with the weakest (May) and strongest (July) models explaining 86% and 97% of the temperature variability, respectively. Mean weekly stream temperature was significantly correlated with mean weekly air temperature in seven streams; however, the relationships were weak to non-significant in the streams influenced by glacial run-off. Streams with &gt;30% glacier coverage showed decreasing stream temperatures with rising summer air temperatures, whereas those with &lt;30% glacier coverage exhibited summertime warming. Glaciers also had a cooling effect on monthly mean stream temperature during the summer (July through September) equivalent to a decrease of 1.1 \u00b0C for each 10% increase in glacier coverage. The maximum weekly average temperature (an index of thermal suitability for salmon) in the six glacial streams was substantially below the lower threshold for optimum salmon growth. This finding suggests that although glaciers are important for moderating summer stream temperatures, future reductions in glacier run-off may actually improve the thermal suitability of some glacially dominated streams in Southeast Alaska for salmon.&nbsp;","parentId":"50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2","contacts":[{"name":"Jason B.

At tidewater glacier termini, discharge drives submarine terminus melting, affects fjord circulation, and is a central component of proglacial marine ecosystems. However, our present inability to track subglacial discharge and its variability significantly hinders our understanding of these processes. Here we report observations of hourly to seasonal variations in 1.5\u201310\u2009Hz seismic tremor that strongly correlate with subglacial discharge but not with basal motion, weather, or discrete icequakes. Our data demonstrate that vigorous discharge occurs from tidewater glaciers during summer, in spite of fast basal motion that could limit the formation of subglacial conduits, and then abates during winter. Furthermore, tremor observations and a melt model demonstrate that drainage efficiency of tidewater glaciers evolves seasonally. Glaciohydraulic tremor provides a means by which to quantify subglacial discharge variations and offers a promising window into otherwise obscured glacierized environments.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2"],"contacts":[{"name":"Timothy C.

The dearth of surface mass-balance data prohibits partitioning of the total mass losses between dynamics and surface forcing; however, the accurate inclusion of calving glaciers into predictive models requires both dynamic and climatic forcing of total mass balance. During 2010, the U.S. Geological Survey collected surface balance data at several locations distributed over the surface of Columbia Glacier to estimate the glacier-wide annual balance for balance year 2010 using the 2007 area-altitude distribution. This report also summarizes data collected in 1978, calculates the 1978 annual surface balance, and uses these observations to constrain the 2010 values, particularly the shape of the balance profile. Both years exhibit balances indicative of near-equilibrium surface mass-balance conditions, and demonstrate the importance of dynamic processes during the rapid retreat.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2"],"contacts":[{"name":"Shad O'Neel","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey","type":"Publisher"}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.er.usgs.gov\/publication\/ds676","rel":"related","title":"Publications Warehouse Index Page","hidden":false},{"type":"browseImage","uri":"https:\/\/pubs.er.usgs.gov\/thumbnails\/ds_676.jpg","rel":"related","title":"Thumbnail","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"type":"Publication","scheme":"USGS Publications Warehouse","name":"Data Series"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2012","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2012-09-20T16:58:15.967-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-26T09:49:39.013-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2012","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2012-09-20T16:58:15.967-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-26T09:49:39.013-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","journal":"Data Series","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Publication Place","value":"Reston, VA"}],"language":"English","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Report"}],"files":[{"size":2867,"dateUploaded":"2014-07-21T20:17:46.276Z","name":"metadata1458039461442911342.xml","pathOnDisk":"__disk__7d\/3b\/6a\/7d3b6a911b56cfd9187e97b66213dea81d3ec188","contentType":"application\/mods+xml","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/505b9f87e4b08c986b31e651?f=__disk__7d%2F3b%2F6a%2F7d3b6a911b56cfd9187e97b66213dea81d3ec188"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/505b9f87e4b08c986b31e651","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"SurfaceMassBala.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Alaska CSC","parent_id":"4f831626e4b0e84f6086809b","people":["Shad O'Neel"],"children":[]},"55cf112ce4b01487cbfc77c3":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/50461941e4b0241d49d62bab","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Surface melt dominates Alaska glacier mass balance","relatedTitle":"Assessing the Sensitivity of Alaska\u2019s Coastal Rainforest Ecosystem to Changes in Glacier Runoff","id":"55cf112ce4b01487cbfc77c3","relatedId":"50461941e4b0241d49d62bab","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/55cf112ce4b01487cbfc77c3","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Assessing the Sensitivity of Alaska\u2019s Coastal Rainforest Ecosystem to Changes in Glacier Runoff","relatedTitle":"Surface melt dominates Alaska glacier mass balance","id":"50461941e4b0241d49d62bab","relatedId":"55cf112ce4b01487cbfc77c3","annotation":null}]},"id":"55cf112ce4b01487cbfc77c3","title":"Surface melt dominates Alaska glacier mass balance","body":"<p>Mountain glaciers comprise a small and widely distributed fraction of the world's terrestrial ice, yet their rapid losses presently drive a large percentage of the cryosphere's contribution to sea level rise. Regional mass balance assessments are challenging over large glacier populations due to remote and rugged geography, variable response of individual glaciers to climate change, and episodic calving losses from tidewater glaciers. In Alaska, we use airborne altimetry from 116 glaciers to estimate a regional mass balance of \u221275\u2009\u00b1\u200911\u2009Gt\u2009yr<sup>\u22121<\/sup> (1994\u20132013).

We find that tidewater glaciers are losing mass at substantially slower rates than other glaciers in Alaska and collectively contribute to only 6% of the regional mass loss.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2"],"contacts":[{"name":"Larsen Chris F","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"E Burgess","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"A.A.

Factors controlling the rapid and nonlinear variations in calving fluxes are poorly understood, and therefore difficult to include in prognostic climate-forced land-ice models. Here we analyse globally distributed calving data sets from Svalbard, Alaska (USA), Greenland and Antarctica in combination with simulations from a first-principles, particle-based numerical calving model to investigate the size and inter-event time of calving events. We find that calving events triggered by the brittle fracture of glacier ice are governed by the same power-law distributions as avalanches in the canonical Abelian sandpile model. This similarity suggests that calving termini behave as self-organized critical systems that readily flip between states of sub-critical advance and super-critical retreat in response to changes in climate and geometric conditions. Observations of sudden ice-shelf collapse and tidewater glacier retreat in response to gradual warming of their environment&nbsp;are consistent with a system fluctuating around its critical point in response to changing external forcing. We propose that self-organized criticality provides a yet unexplored framework for investigations into calving and projections of sea level rise.\n<br> \n<br> \n<strong>This publication was developed as a part of the project,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/display-project\/4f831626e4b0e84f6086809b\/50461941e4b0241d49d62bab\">Assessing the Sensitivity of Alaska\u2019s Coastal Rainforest Ecosystem to Changes in Glacier Runoff<\/a>.<\/strong>","parentId":"50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2","contacts":[{"name":"J.

Here using observations from Yahtse Glacier, Alaska, we describe methods to detect, locate, and characterize calving icequakes. We combine these icequake records with a coincident, manually generated record of observed calving events to develop and validate a statistical model through which we can infer iceberg sizes from the properties of calving icequakes. We find that the icequake duration is the single most significant predictor of an iceberg's size. We then apply this model to 18 months of seismic recordings and find elevated iceberg calving flux during the summer and fall and a pronounced lull in calving during midwinter. Calving flux is sensitive to semidiurnal tidal stage. Large calving events are tens of percent more likely during falling and low tides than during rising and high tides, consistent with a view that deeper water has a stabilizing influence on glacier termini. Multiple factors affect the occurrence of mechanical fractures that ultimately lead to iceberg calving. At Yahtse Glacier, seismology allows us to demonstrate that variations in the rate of submarine melt are a dominant control on iceberg calving rates at seasonal timescales. On hourly to daily timescales, tidal modulation of the normal stress against the glacier terminus reveals the nonlinear glacier response to changes in the near-terminus stress field.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2"],"contacts":[{"name":"T.C.

We present a new method that calculates ice thickness via an estimate of ice flux. We solve the familiar continuity equation between adjacent flowlines, which decreases the computational time required compared to a solution on the whole grid. We test the method on Columbia Glacier, a large tidewater glacier in Alaska, USA, and compare calculated and measured ice thicknesses, with favorable results. This shows the potential of this method for estimating ice thickness distribution of glaciers for which only surface data are available. We find that both the mean thickness and volume of Columbia Glacier were approximately halved over the period 1957\u20132007, from 281m to 143 m, and from 294 km<sup>3<\/sup> to 134 km<sup>3<\/sup>, respectively. Using bedrock slope and considering how waves of thickness change propagate through the glacier, we conduct a brief analysis of the instability of Columbia Glacier, which leads us to conclude that the rapid portion of the retreat may be nearing an end.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2"],"contacts":[{"name":"R.W.

We obtained \u03b4 P by differencing X- and P-band digital elevation models. \u03b4 P varied significantly over the glacier, but it was possible to distinguish representative zones. In the accumulation area, \u03b4 P decreased with decreasing elevation from 18&plusmn;3 m in the percolation zone to 10&plusmn;4 m in the wet snow zone. In the central portion of the ablation area, a location free of debris and crevasses, we identified a zone of very high \u03b4 P (34&plusmn;4 m) which decreased at lower elevations (23&plusmn;3 m in bare ice and 5 - 10 m in debris-covered ice). We observe that the spatial configuration of \u03b4 P is consistent with the expected thermal regime of each zone: \u03b4 P is high in areas where cold firn\/ice likely occurs (i.e. percolation zone and upper ablation area) and low in areas where temperate surface firn\/ice likely exists (wet snow zone and lower ablation area). We suggest that the very high \u03b4 P observed in the upper ablation area is due to the presence of a cold surface layer.","parentId":"50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2","contacts":[{"name":"Alessio Gusmeroli","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Alaska Fairbanks"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Anthony Arendt","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Alaska Fairbanks"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Donald Atwood","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Bert Kampes","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Mark Sanford","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Joanna C Young","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alaska CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/igsoc\/agl\/2013\/00000054\/00000064\/art00026","title":"Abstract and Full Text","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"glaciers"},{"name":"Kahiltna Glacier"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013-08","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-01-02T09:11:48.422-07:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-21T13:09:36.865-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2013","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-01-02T09:11:48.422-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-21T13:09:36.865-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Annals of Glaciology","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI Number","value":" doi: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3189\/2013AoG64A114 "}],"edition":"Volume 54 issue 64 pages 218 - 223 September 2013","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Alaska CSC","parent_id":"4f831626e4b0e84f6086809b","people":["Alessio Gusmeroli","Anthony Arendt","Donald Atwood","Bert Kampes","Mark Sanford","Joanna C Young"],"orgs":["Alaska CSC"],"children":[]},"54120cd9e4b0fe7e184a8fb7":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/50461941e4b0241d49d62bab","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Watershed Glacier Coverage Influences Dissolved Organic Matter Biogeochemistry in Coastal Watersheds of Southeast Alaska","relatedTitle":"Assessing the Sensitivity of Alaska\u2019s Coastal Rainforest Ecosystem to Changes in Glacier Runoff","id":"54120cd9e4b0fe7e184a8fb7","relatedId":"50461941e4b0241d49d62bab","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/54120cd9e4b0fe7e184a8fb7","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Assessing the Sensitivity of Alaska\u2019s Coastal Rainforest Ecosystem to Changes in Glacier Runoff","relatedTitle":"Watershed Glacier Coverage Influences Dissolved Organic Matter Biogeochemistry in Coastal Watersheds of Southeast Alaska","id":"50461941e4b0241d49d62bab","relatedId":"54120cd9e4b0fe7e184a8fb7","annotation":null}]},"id":"54120cd9e4b0fe7e184a8fb7","title":"Watershed Glacier Coverage Influences Dissolved Organic Matter Biogeochemistry in Coastal Watersheds of Southeast Alaska","body":"Abstract (from http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10021-014-9777-1): The Coast Mountains of southeast Alaska are currently experiencing some of the highest rates of glacier volume loss on Earth, with unknown implications for proglacial stream biogeochemistry. We analyzed streamwater for \u03b418O and dissolved organic matter (DOM) biogeochemistry (concentration, \u03b413C-dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and fluorescence characterization) during the 2012 glacial runoff season from three coastal watersheds in southeast Alaska that ranged in glacier coverage from 0 to 49% and a glacier outflow stream. Our goal was to assess how DOM biogeochemistry may change as receding glaciers are replaced by forests and glaciers contribute less meltwater to streamflow. Discharge and streamwater \u03b418O varied seasonally reflecting varying contributions of rainfall and snow\/icemelt to streamflow over the runoff season. Mean DOC concentrations were lowest in the glacial outflow and highest in the non-glacial stream reflecting an increasing contribution of vascular plant-derived carbon with decreasing watershed glaciation. Fluorescence and \u03b413C-DOC signatures indicated that DOM shifted from vascular plant-derived, humic-like material in the non-glacial stream toward more \u03b413C-DOC enriched, glacier-derived DOM in the glacial outflow. Streamwater \u03b418O was significantly correlated to DOC concentration, \u03b413C-DOC, and protein-like fluorescence of streamwater DOM (all \n<em>P<\/em>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05), demonstrating that changes in the source of streamwater across the glacial watershed continuum have important implications for the amount and quality of stream DOM export. Overall, our findings show that continued glacial recession and subsequent changes in glacial runoff could substantially influence the biogeochemistry of coastal temperature watersheds by altering the timing, magnitude, and chemical signature of DOM delivered to streams.","parentId":"50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2","contacts":[{"name":"Jason B.

Few survey data streams exist for such an assessment. The Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey is one notable exception to this limitation. This survey, conducted annually through the leadership of the Division of Migratory Bird Management of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, samples 5 million square kilometers and covers prairies, parklands, boreal forest, and coastal habitats. Additional surveys similarly cover tundra areas of the U.S. and Canada. Data from these surveys are used annually in an adaptive management and decision framework that provides objective model output for how harvest regulations across the continent should be implemented to maintain existing populations. We propose to estimate rates of species colonization or extinction (i.e., \u2018occupancy\u2019) using a spatially and temporally explicit model. We will also model the relationship between occupancy and habitat and climate covariates. These analyses will identify how species distributions of waterbirds for much of the continent are responding to climate processes. We anticipate that our results could affect monitoring design and the adaptive harvest management (AHM) process in several ways. One outcome may be a recommendation to eliminate some survey segments or strata or add in new ones. A second possibility is that the underlying demographic model structures that drive the adaptive management decision models may need to be modified to include progressive environmental change that is ultimately driven by climate. Our results and how they will impact future surveys and AHM will be presented both in publications and in meetings, including presentations at conferences, flyway meetings, and other appropriate venues. We will work closely through all phases of this project with US Fish and Wildlife Service colleagues. Additionally, we will partner with the University of Alaska. <\/div>","parentId":"5016dd28e4b06fb5ce8b73ad","contacts":[{"name":"Joel A Schmutz","oldPartyId":9130,"type":"Principal

Integrated Ecosystem Model to Illustrate Future Landscape Change","body":"<p>Ongoing and future climate change throughout Alaska has the potential to affect terrestrial ecosystems and the services that they provide to the people of Alaska and the nation.

The IEM generates maps and other products that illustrate how arctic and boreal landscapes might change in response to other climate change-driven changes in vegetation, hydrology, permafrost (e.g. frozen ground) etc.<br> <br> The IEM integrates three different models:<br> - the Alaska Frame-Based Ecosystem Code (ALFRESCO), which simulates wildland fire and vegetation establishment and growth;<br> - the Geophysical Institute Permafrost Lab model (GIPL), which simulates characteristics of soils, hydrology, vegetation, plant community composition, biomass, and carbon balance in soil;<br> - and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) [which includes the Dynamic Vegetation (DVM) and Dynamic Organic Soil (DOS) models], which simulates permafrost (i.e. frozen ground) dynamics and changes.<\/p>","purpose":"Ongoing climate change throughout Alaska has the potential to affect terrestrial ecosystems and the services that they provide to the people of Alaska and the nation. These services include the provisioning of food and fiber by Alaskan ecosystems, the importance of ecosystems to recreation, cultural, and spiritual activities of people in Alaska, and the role that Alaska ecosystems play in regulating the climate system. Assessments of the effects of climate change on ecosystem services has in part been hindered by the lack of tools capable of forecasting how landscape structure and function might change in response to climate change. In Alaska, such tools need to consider how ecological processes play out in both space and time. Landscapes may change substantially in time and space because of shifting composition of species dominance (e.g., an increase of shrubs in tundra) and species migration (e.g., treeline advance). These shifts in landscape structure and function may be caused by changes in disturbance regimes (e.g., fire, insects, wind throw), permafrost integrity, and hydrology across the landscape. In this study, we propose to develop and apply an ecosystem model for Alaska that is capable of forecasting how landscape structure and function might change in response to how climate change influences interactions among disturbance regimes, permafrost integrity, hydrology, vegetation succession, and vegetation migration. This tool would provide scenarios of changes in landscape structure and function that could be used by resource-specific impact models to assess the effects of climate change on specific natural resources.","parentId":"5016dd28e4b06fb5ce8b73ad","contacts":[{"name":"David McGuire","oldPartyId":16249,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"admcguire@alaska.edu","organization":{"displayText":"Alaska Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, University of Alaska, Fairbanks"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"T.

bias in carbon dioxide flux measurements with the EC150 and the IRGASON open-path gas analyzers","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0168192316303446):&nbsp;Across a global network of eddy covariance flux towers, two relatively new open-path infrared gas analyzers (IRGAs), the IRGASON and the EC150, are increasingly used to measure net carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2<\/sub>) fluxes (<em>F<sub>c_OP<\/sub><\/em>). Differences in net CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;fluxes derived from open- and closed-path IRGAs in general remain poorly constrained. In particular, the performance of the IRGASON and the EC150 for measuring&nbsp;<em>F<sub>c_OP<\/sub><\/em>&nbsp;has not been characterized yet. These IRGAs measure CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;absorption, which is scaled with air temperature and pressure before converting it to instantaneous CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;density. This sensor-internal conversion is based on a slow-response thermistor air temperature measurement. Here, we test if the high-frequency temperature attenuation causes selectively systematic&nbsp;<em>F<sub>c_OP<\/sub><\/em>&nbsp;errors that scale with kinematic temperature fluxes. First, we examine the relationship between wintertime&nbsp;<em>F<sub>c_OP<\/sub><\/em>&nbsp;and kinematic temperature fluxes for eight northern ecosystems. Second, we investigate how residuals between&nbsp;<em>F<sub>c_OP<\/sub><\/em>&nbsp;and CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;fluxes from co-located closed-path IRGAs (<em>F<sub>C_CP<\/sub><\/em>) are related to kinematic temperature fluxes for three different ecosystem types (i.e., boreal forest, grassland, and irrigated cropland). We find that kinematic temperature fluxes, but not mean ambient air temperatures or CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;flux regime, consistently determine the absolute magnitude of<em>F<sub>c_OP<\/sub><\/em>&nbsp;errors. This selectively systematic bias causes the most pronounced relative&nbsp;<em>F<sub>c_OP<\/sub><\/em>errors to occur when \u201ctrue\u201d CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;fluxes are low and kinematic temperature fluxes are high (e.g., northern ecosystems during the winter). The smallest relative errors occur during periods with large \u201ctrue\u201d CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;fluxes and low kinematic temperature fluxes. To address this bias, we replace the slow-response air temperature in the absorption-to-CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;density conversion with a fast-response air temperature derived from sonic anemometer measurements. The use of the fast-response air temperature improves the agreement between half-hourly&nbsp;<em>F<sub>c_OP<\/sub><\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>F<sub>C_CP<\/sub><\/em>&nbsp;for all open- versus closed-path IRGA comparisons. Additionally, cumulative&nbsp;<em>F<sub>c_OP<\/sub><\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>F<sub>c_CP<\/sub><\/em>&nbsp;sums are more comparable as differences drop from 63 %\u201313 % to 20 %\u20138 %. The improved IRGASON and EC150 performance enhances the ability and confidence to synthesize flux measurements across multiple sites including these two relatively new IRGAs.","parentId":"503fab88e4b09851b69ab40c","contacts":[{"name":"M.

A warming climate can induce environmental changes that accelerate the microbial breakdown of organic carbon and the release of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane. This feedback can accelerate climate change, but the magnitude and timing of greenhouse gas emission from these regions and their impact on climate change remain uncertain. Here we find that current evidence suggests a gradual and prolonged release of greenhouse gas emissions in a warming climate and present a research strategy with which to target poorly understood aspects of permafrost carbon dynamics.","parentId":"503fab88e4b09851b69ab40c","contacts":[{"name":"E.

Fire that burns the organic layer can trigger dramatic changes in the underlying permafrost, leading to accelerated ground thawing within a relatively short time. In this study, we addressed the following questions. (1) Which factors determine post-fire ground temperature dynamics in lowland and upland black spruce forests? (2) What levels of burn severity will cause irreversible permafrost degradation in these ecosystems?\n\nWe evaluated these questions in a transient modeling\u2013sensitivity analysis framework to assess the sensitivity of permafrost to climate, burn severity, soil organic layer thickness, and soil moisture content in lowland (with thick organic layers, ~80 cm) and upland (with thin organic layers, ~30 cm) black spruce ecosystems. The results indicate that climate warming accompanied by fire disturbance could significantly accelerate permafrost degradation. In upland black spruce forest, permafrost could completely degrade in an 18 m soil column within 120 years of a severe fire in an unchanging climate. In contrast, in a lowland black spruce forest, permafrost is more resilient to disturbance and can persist under a combination of moderate burn severity and climate warming.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["503fab88e4b09851b69ab40c"],"contacts":[{"name":"Elchin E.

The surface organic horizons insulate the deeper soil from variations in atmospheric temperature. The removal of these insulating horizons through consumption by fire increases the vulnerability of permafrost to thaw, and the carbon stored in permafrost to decomposition. In this study we ask how warming and fire regime may influence spatial and temporal changes in active layer and carbon dynamics across a boreal forest landscape in interior Alaska. To address this question, we (1) developed and tested a predictive model of the effect of fire severity on soil organic horizons that depends on landscape-level conditions and (2) used this model to evaluate the long-term consequences of warming and changes in fire regime on active layer and soil carbon dynamics of black spruce forests across interior Alaska. The predictive model of fire severity, designed from the analysis of field observations, reproduces the effect of local topography (landform category, the slope angle and aspect and flow accumulation), weather conditions (drought index, soil moisture) and fire characteristics (day of year and size of the fire) on the reduction of the organic layer caused by fire. The integration of the fire severity model into an ecosystem process-based model allowed us to document the relative importance and interactions among local topography, fire regime and climate warming on active layer and soil carbon dynamics. Lowlands were more resistant to severe fires and climate warming, showing smaller increases in active layer thickness and soil carbon loss compared to drier flat uplands and slopes. In simulations that included the effects of both warming and fire at the regional scale, fire was primarily responsible for a reduction in organic layer thickness of 0.06 m on average by 2100 that led to an increase in active layer thickness of 1.1 m on average by 2100. The combination of warming and fire led to a simulated cumulative loss of 9.6 kgC m<sup>\u22122<\/sup> on average by 2100. Our analysis suggests that ecosystem carbon storage in boreal forests in interior Alaska is particularly vulnerable, primarily due to the combustion of organic layer thickness in fire and the related increase in active layer thickness that exposes previously protected permafrost soil carbon to decomposition.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["503fab88e4b09851b69ab40c"],"contacts":[{"name":"H.

In nearby tundra regions, studies have identified a rapid increase in thermokarst formation (i.e., pits) over recent decades in response to climate warming, facilitating changes in polygonal tundra geomorphology. We assessed the future impact of 100&nbsp;years of tundra geomorphic change on peak growing season carbon exchange in response to: (i) landscape succession associated with the thaw-lake cycle; and (ii) low, moderate, and extreme scenarios of thermokarst pit formation (10%, 30%, and 50%) reported for Alaskan arctic tundra sites. We developed a 30&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;30&nbsp;m resolution tundra geomorphology map (overall accuracy:75%; Kappa:0.69) for our ~1800&nbsp;km\u22832; study area composed of ten classes; drained slope, high center polygon, flat-center polygon, low center polygon, coalescent low center polygon, polygon trough, meadow, ponds, rivers, and lakes, to determine their spatial distribution across the Barrow Peninsula.

Here we describe the distribution of thermokarst landforms in the continuous permafrost zone of Arctic Alaska, analyze linkages to the underlying surficial geology, and discuss the vulnerability of different types of landscapes to future thaw. We identified nine major thermokarst landforms and then mapped their distributions in twelve representative study areas totaling 300-km<\/span><sup>2<\/sup><span>. These study areas differ in their geologic history, permafrost-ice content, and ground thermal regime. Results show that 63% of the entire study area is occupied by thermokarst landforms and that the distribution of thermokarst landforms and overall landscape complexity varies markedly with surficial geology. Areas underlain by ice-rich marine silt are the most affected by thermokarst (97% of total area), whereas areas underlain by glacial drift are least affected (14%). Drained thermokarst-lake basins are the most widespread thermokarst landforms, covering 33% of the entire study region, with greater prevalence in areas of marine silt (48% coverage), marine sand (47%), and aeolian silt (34%). Thermokarst-lakes are the second most common thermokarst landform, covering 16% of the study region, with highest coverage in areas underlain by marine silt (39% coverage). Thermokarst troughs and pits cover 7% of the study region and are the third most prevalent thermokarst landform. They are most common in areas underlain by deltaic sands and gravels (18% coverage) and marine sand (12%). Alas valleys are widespread in areas of aeolian silt (14%) located in gradually sloping uplands. Areas of marine silt have been particularly vulnerable to thaw in the past because they are ice-rich and have low-gradient topography facilitating the repeated development of thermokarst-lakes. In the future, ice-rich aeolian, upland terrain (yedoma) will be particularly susceptible to thaw because it still contains massive concentrations of ground ice in the form of syngenetic ice-wedges that have remained largely intact since the Pleistocene.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5086e376e4b0a1435286ddfb","503fab88e4b09851b69ab40c"],"contacts":[{"name":"Louise Farquharson","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Dan H Mann","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Guido Grosse","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Benjamin M.

Here we describe the construction and evaluation of 771-m-resolution gridded historical and statistically downscaled projections of snow\/rain partitioning for the state of Alaska at decadal temporal resolution. The method developed here uses observational data to describe the relationship between average monthly temperature and the fraction of wet days in that month receiving snow, the snow-day fraction. Regionally and seasonally specific equations were developed to accommodate variability in synoptic scale climatology of rain and snow events. These equations were then applied to gridded decadal temperature data and projections. The gridded products provide a reasonable characterization of snow-day fraction throughout the state. However, there are local deviations from the regional relationships, particularly in the topographically complex areas ringing the Gulf of Alaska and Cook Inlet. When applied to questions about changing precipitation regimes in northern, western and south-eastern Alaska, these data demonstrate the potential for marked changes from snow-dominated to mixed precipitation regimes and also exhibit a wide range of potential future conditions.

The method is applied to four sites in Alaska. To validate the method we used measured snow densities and snow water equivalents. The modeled thermal conductivities of snow for the two interior Alaska sites have relatively low values and reach their maximum near the end of the snow season, while the conductivities at the two sites on the Alaskan North Slope are higher and reach their maximum earlier in the snow season. We show that the reconstructed daily thermal conductivities allow for more accurate modeling of ground surface temperatures when compared to applying a constant thermal conductivity for the snow layer.","parentId":"503fab88e4b09851b69ab40c","contacts":[{"name":"E.E.

Thermokarst has affected the lowlands of the Tanana Flats in central Alaska for centuries, as thawing permafrost collapses forests that transition to wetlands. Located within the discontinuous permafrost zone, this region has significantly warmed over the past half-century, and much of these carbon-rich permafrost soils are now within ~0.5&nbsp;\u00b0C of thawing. Increased permafrost thaw in lowland boreal forests in response to warming may have consequences for the climate system. This study evaluates the trajectories and potential drivers of 60&nbsp;years of forest change in a landscape subjected to permafrost thaw in unburned dominant forest types (paper birch and black spruce) associated with location on elevated permafrost plateau and across multiple time periods (1949, 1978, 1986, 1998, and 2009) using historical and contemporary aerial and satellite images for change detection. We developed (i) a deterministic statistical model to evaluate the potential climatic controls on forest change using gradient boosting and regression tree analysis, and (ii) a 30&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;30&nbsp;m land cover map of the Tanana Flats to estimate the potential landscape-level losses of forest area due to thermokarst from 1949 to 2009. Over the 60-year period, we observed a nonlinear loss of birch forests and a relatively continuous gain of spruce forest associated with thermokarst and forest succession, while gradient boosting\/regression tree models identify precipitation and forest fragmentation as the primary factors controlling birch and spruce forest change, respectively. Between 1950 and 2009, landscape-level analysis estimates a transition of ~15&nbsp;km\u00b2 or ~7% of birch forests to wetlands, where the greatest change followed warm periods. This work highlights that the vulnerability and resilience of lowland ice-rich permafrost ecosystems to climate changes depend on forest type.","parentId":"503fab88e4b09851b69ab40c","contacts":[{"name":"Mark J.

This study concentrates on two years, 2007 and 1996, with different arctic sea ice conditions and tundra fire activity. The year of 2007 is characterized by a low summer sea ice extent (second lowest) and high tundra fire activity, while 1996 had high sea ice extent, and few tundra fires. Atmospheric lateral boundary forcing from the NCEP\/NCAR Reanalysis drove the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model, along with varying sea ice surface forcing designed to delineate the role of sea ice. WRF runs successfully reproduced the differences between 1996 and 2007. Surprisingly, replacing sea ice conditions in 1996 run by those from 2007 and vice versa (2007 run with 1996 sea ice) did not change the overall picture. The atmospheric circulation in August of 1996 included a significant low-pressure system over the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. However, in 2007, a high-pressure system dominated the circulation over the Beaufort Sea. It is argued that this difference in large-scale patterns, rather than retreat of sea ice, was responsible for anomalously dry and warm atmospheric conditions over the North Slope in summer and autumn 2007, suitable for high tundra fire activity. Circulation in 2012 is contrasted with that in 2007 to further stress its importance for local weather on the North Slope.","parentId":"503fab88e4b09851b69ab40c","contacts":[{"name":"Vladimir A.

from anoxic soil incubations","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gcb.12875\/abstract):&nbsp;Permafrost thaw can alter the soil environment through changes in soil moisture, frequently resulting in soil saturation, a shift to anaerobic decomposition, and changes in the plant community. These changes, along with thawing of previously frozen organic material, can alter the form and magnitude of greenhouse gas production from permafrost ecosystems. We synthesized existing methane (CH <sub>4<\/sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2<\/sub>) production measurements from anaerobic incubations of boreal and tundra soils from the geographic permafrost region to evaluate large-scale controls of anaerobic CO <sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;and CH <sub>4<\/sub>&nbsp;production and compare the relative importance of landscape-level factors (e.g., vegetation type and landscape position), soil properties (e.g., pH, depth, and soil type), and soil environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and relative water table position). We found fivefold higher maximum CH <sub>4<\/sub>&nbsp;production per gram soil carbon from organic soils than mineral soils. Maximum CH <sub>4<\/sub>&nbsp;production from soils in the active layer (ground that thaws and refreezes annually) was nearly four times that of permafrost per gram soil carbon, and CH <sub>4<\/sub>&nbsp;production per gram soil carbon was two times greater from sites without permafrost than sites with permafrost. Maximum CH <sub>4<\/sub>&nbsp;and median anaerobic CO <sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;production decreased with depth, while CO <sub>2<\/sub>:CH <sub>4<\/sub>&nbsp;production increased with depth. Maximum CH <sub>4<\/sub>&nbsp;production was highest in soils with herbaceous vegetation and soils that were either consistently or periodically inundated. This synthesis identifies the need to consider biome, landscape position, and vascular\/moss vegetation types when modeling CH <sub>4<\/sub>&nbsp;production in permafrost ecosystems and suggests the need for longer-term anaerobic incubations to fully capture CH <sub>4<\/sub>&nbsp;dynamics. Our results demonstrate that as climate warms in arctic and boreal regions, rates of anaerobic CO <sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;and CH <sub>4<\/sub>&nbsp;production will increase, not only as a result of increased temperature, but also from shifts in vegetation and increased ground saturation that will accompany permafrost thaw.","parentId":"503fae8ee4b09851b69ab42c","contacts":[{"name":"Claire C Treat","oldPartyId":66081,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"ctreat@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Scientist","firstName":"Claire","middleName":"C","lastName":"Treat","organization":{"displayText":"University of Alaska Fairbanks"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"6503295232","streetAddress":{"zip":"94025","city":"Menlo Park","state":"CA","line1":"345 Middlefield Road"},"buildingCode":"WBM","name":"CN=Claire C Treat,OU=NON-USGS,OU=FDCC_STIG Users,OU=MenloParkCA-G VHZ,OU=MenloParkCA-M,OU=WR,DC=gs,DC=doi,DC=net - Primary Location","mailAddress":[],"building":"Mckelvey Bldg 15"}},{"name":"Susan Natali","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Woods Hole Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jessica Ernakovich","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Colorado State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Colleen M.

To better understand these dynamics, we established three sites in Alaska that vary in permafrost regime, including a black spruce peat plateau forest with stable permafrost, an internal collapse scar bog formed as a result of thermokarst, and a rich fen without permafrost. Measurements include year-round eddy covariance estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2 ), water, and energy fluxes, associated environmental variables, and methane (CH4 ) fluxes at the collapse scar bog. The ecosystems all acted as net sinks of CO2 &nbsp;in 2011 and 2012, when air temperature and precipitation remained near long-term means. In 2013, under a late snowmelt and late leaf out followed by a hot, dry summer, the permafrost forest and collapse scar bog were sources of CO2 . In this same year, CO2 &nbsp;uptake in the fen increased, largely because summer inundation from groundwater inputs suppressed ecosystem respiration. CO2 &nbsp;exchange in the permafrost forest and collapse scar bog was sensitive to warm air temperatures, with 0.5 g C m-2 &nbsp;lost each day when maximum air temperature was very warm (\u226529&deg;C). The bog lost 4981 &plusmn; 300 mg CH4 &nbsp;m-2 &nbsp;between April and September 2013, indicating that this ecosystem acted as a significant source of both CO2 &nbsp;and CH4 &nbsp;to the atmosphere in 2013. These results suggest that boreal peatland responses to warming and drying, both of which are expected to occur in a changing climate, will depend on permafrost regime.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> \n<strong>This publication was developed as part of the project,&nbsp; <a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/display-project\/4f831626e4b0e84f6086809b\/503fae15e4b09851b69ab425\">Ecology, Soil Carbon, and Permafrost Experiments (ECOSCAPE)<\/a>.<\/strong>","parentId":"503fae8ee4b09851b69ab42c","contacts":[{"name":"Euskirchen, E.

In this study, we used porewater stable isotopes collected from both the edge and center of a thermokarst bog in Interior Alaska to estimate in situ microbial reaction rates. We expected that near the edge of the thaw feature, actively thawing permafrost and greater abundance of sedges would increase carbon, oxygen and nutrient availability, enabling faster microbial rates relative to the center of the thaw feature. We developed three different conceptual reaction networks that explained the temporal change in porewater CO2, CH4,&nbsp; \n<em>\u03b4<\/em>&nbsp;13C\u2013CO2&nbsp;and&nbsp; \n<em>\u03b4<\/em>&nbsp;13C\u2013CH4. All three reaction-network models included methane production, methane oxidation and CO2&nbsp;production, and two of the models included homoacetogenesis\u2014a reaction not previously included in isotope-based porewater models. All three models fit the data equally well, but rates resulting from the models differed. Most notably, inclusion of homoacetogenesis altered the modeled pathways of methane production when the reaction was directly coupled to methanogenesis, and it decreased gross methane production rates by up to a factor of five when it remained decoupled from methanogenesis. The ability of all three conceptual reaction networks to successfully match the measured data indicate that this technique for estimating in situ reaction rates requires other data and information from the site to confirm the considered set of microbial reactions. Despite these differences, all models indicated that, as expected, rates were greater at the edge than in the center of the thaw bog, that rates at the edge increased more during the growing season than did rates in the center, and that the ratio of acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was greater at the edge than in the center. In both locations, modeled rates (excluding methane oxidation) increased with depth. A puzzling outcome from the effort was that none of the models could fit the porewater dataset without generating \u201cfugitive\u201d carbon (i.e., methane or acetate generated by the models but not detected at the field site), indicating that either our conceptualization of the reactions occurring at the site remains incomplete or our site measurements are missing important carbon transformations and\/or carbon fluxes.

This process is largely dependent on microbial responses, but we know little about microbial activity in intact, let alone in thawing, permafrost. Molecular approaches have recently revealed the identities and functional gene composition of microorganisms in some permafrost soils2, 3, 4 and a rapid shift in functional gene composition during short-term thaw experiments3. However, the fate of permafrost carbon depends on climatic, hydrological and microbial responses to thaw at decadal scales5, 6. Here we use the combination of several molecular \u2018omics\u2019 approaches to determine the phylogenetic composition of the microbial communities, including several draft genomes of novel species, their functional potential and activity in soils representing different states of thaw: intact permafrost, seasonally thawed active layer and thermokarst bog. The multi-omics strategy reveals a good correlation of process rates to omics data for dominant processes, such as methanogenesis in the bog, as well as novel survival strategies for potentially active microbes in permafrost.","parentId":"503fae8ee4b09851b69ab42c","contacts":[{"name":"Jenni Hultman","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Mark P Waldrop","oldPartyId":10856,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"mwaldrop@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Soil Scientist","personalTitle":"Mr.","firstName":"Mark","middleName":"P","lastName":"Waldrop","cellPhone":"6507149294","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Volcano Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"6503294920","officePhone":"6503295005","streetAddress":{"zip":"94025","city":"Menlo Park","state":"CA","line1":"345 Middlefield Road"},"buildingCode":"WBM","name":"Mark P Waldrop\/GD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"94025-3561","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"962","city":"Menlo Park","state":"CA","line1":"Bldg 15, McKelvey Building, 345 Middlefield Road, Mail Stop 962"},"building":"Mckelvey Bldg 15"}},{"name":"Rachel Mackelprang","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"California State University Northridge"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Maude M.

Mean anaerobic CO2 production potential at 10 cm depth (14.1 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcmol C g-1 d-1) was as high as aerobic CO2 production potential (10.6 \u00b1 1.5 \u03bcmol C g-1 d-1), while CH4 production was low (mean of 7.8 \u00b1 1.5 nmol C g-1 d-1). Denitrification enzyme activity indicated a very high denitrification potential (197 \u00b1 23 \u03bcg N g-1 d-1), but net reduction suggested this was a relatively minor pathway for anaerobic CO2 production. Abundances of denitrifier genes (nirK and nosZ) did not change across water table treatments. &nbsp;reduction also did not appear to be an important pathway for anaerobic CO2 production. The net accumulation of acetate and formate as decomposition end products in the raised water table treatment suggested that fermentation was a significant pathway for carbon mineralization, even in the presence of . Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were the strongest predictors of potential anaerobic and aerobic CO2 production. Across all water table treatments, the CO2:CH4 ratio increased with initial DOC leachate concentrations. While the field water table treatment did not have a significant effect on mean CO2 or CH4 production potential, the CO2:CH4 ratio was highest in shallow peat incubations from the drained treatment. These data suggest that with continued drying or with a more variable water table, anaerobic CO2 production may be favored over CH4 production in this rich fen. Future research examining the potential for dissolved organic substances to facilitate anaerobic respiration, or alternative redox processes that limit the effectiveness of organic acids as substrates in anaerobic metabolism, would help explain additional uncertainty concerning carbon mineralization in this system.","parentId":"503fae8ee4b09851b69ab42c","contacts":[{"name":"E.S.

Snow cover helps regulate the earth\u2019s temperature and stores water on the landscape. As it melts, snow hydrates the soil and replenishes the freshwater supplies of streams and lakes, providing water for vegetation, wildlife, and human activities such as agriculture and electricity generation. Understanding present and future snow conditions under climate change is critical for managing Alaska\u2019s natural resources, yet many scientists, land managers, and policymakers lack this information at useful scales. Hence, the goal of this project was to produce an advanced snow modeling system for part of the Arctic that predicts a variety of factors across space and time, including estimates of snowfall, snow depth, and changes in snow season length. The model was developed with collaborative input from ecologists, biologists, and geophysical scientists to determine which outputs would be most useful. These datasets are presently being used by the Arctic Landscape Conservation Cooperative for continued climate, hydrologic, and ecosystem research.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","purpose":"Snow conditions are extremely important to a wide range of hydrologic and ecosystem components and processes, including those related to surface energy and moisture stores and fluxes, vegetation, mammals, birds, and fish. The required snow datasets currently do not exist at the required spatial and temporal scales needed by end users such as scientists, land managers, and policy makers. The goal of this project is to produce spatially distributed, time evolving, snow datasets for the Arctic LCC that can be used in a wide range of climate, hydrologic, and ecosystem applications.\n\nThe project researcher will use the MicroMet\/SnowModel snow-evolution modeling system to simulate a range of snow-related variables over an Arctic domain of interest to the Arctic LCC, and will lead a workshop to be attended by ecologists, biologists, and geophysical scientists from across agencies to determine what model outputs they would find most useful so that he can custom-code his model to ingest appropriate data and to produce those outputs.","parentId":"5016dab1e4b06fb5ce8b739e","contacts":[{"name":"Glen Liston","oldPartyId":60529,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"glen.liston@colostate.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Glen","lastName":"Liston","organization":{"displayText":"Colorado State University","directoryId":"22853"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alaska CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"name":"snow"},{"type":"label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2012"},{"type":"label","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Alaska CSC"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Start","dateString":"2012-09-30","label":"Start Date"},"1":{"type":"End","dateString":"2013-12-31","label":"End Date"},"2":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-08-15T12:24:46.172-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"3":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-12-08T06:44:16.843-07:00","label":"Last Updated"},"start":"2012","end":"2013","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-08-15T12:24:46.172-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-12-08T06:44:16.843-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"}],"files":[{"imageWidth":398,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":17729,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2016-03-22T18:59:54.000Z","name":"AK-2012-3_PolarBear_BeaufortSea_EricRegehr_USGS.JPG","pathOnDisk":"__disk__42\/d6\/4f\/42d64f94a2e6a689c307f7ac38d60ff0d4b4eadb","title":"Male polar bear in the Beaufort Sea -

Alaska","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/2015JF003539\/abstract):&nbsp;A quantitative understanding of snow thickness and snow water equivalent (SWE) on glaciers is essential to a wide range of scientific and resource management topics. However, robust SWE estimates are observationally challenging, in part because SWE can vary abruptly over short distances in complex terrain due to interactions between topography and meteorological processes. In spring 2013, we measured snow accumulation on several glaciers around the Gulf of Alaska using both ground- and helicopter-based ground-penetrating radar surveys, complemented by extensive ground truth observations. We found that SWE can be highly variable (40% difference) over short spatial scales (tens to hundreds of meters), especially in the ablation zone where the underlying ice surfaces are typically rough. Elevation provides the dominant basin-scale influence on SWE, with gradients ranging from 115 to 400 mm\/100 m. Regionally, total accumulation and the accumulation gradient are strongly controlled by a glacier's distance from the coastal moisture source. Multiple linear regressions, used to calculate distributed SWE fields, show that robust results require adequate sampling of the true distribution of multiple terrain parameters. Final SWE estimates (comparable to winter balances) show reasonable agreement with both the Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model climate data set (9\u201336% difference) and the U.S. Geological Survey Alaska Benchmark Glaciers (6\u201336% difference). All the glaciers in our study exhibit substantial sensitivity to changing snow-rain fractions, regardless of their location in a coastal or continental climate. While process-based SWE projections remain elusive, the collection of ground-penetrating radar (GPR)-derived data sets provides a greatly enhanced perspective on the spatial distribution of SWE and will pave the way for future work that may eventually allow such projections.","parentId":"5040dbe5e4b07a90c5ec1485","contacts":[{"name":"Daniel J

carbon sources (leaf litter, epilithic biofilm, and particulate organic matter) and consumers (aquatic macroinvertebrates and fish) in a nonglacial stream and two reaches of the heavily glaciated Herbert River. We tested the hypothesis that proglacial stream food webs are sustained by organic carbon released from glacial ecosystems. Carbon sources and consumers in the nonglacial stream had carbon isotope values that ranged from -30\u2030 to -25\u2030 for \u03b4<sup>13<\/sup>C and from -14\u2030 to 53\u2030 for \u0394<sup>14<\/sup>C reflecting a food web sustained mainly on contemporary primary production. In contrast, biofilm in the two glacial stream sites was highly \u0394<sup>14<\/sup>C-depleted (-215\u2030 to 175\u2030) relative to the nonglacial stream consistent with the assimilation of ancient glacier organic carbon. IsoSource modeling showed that in upper Herbert River, macroinvertebrates (\u0394<sup>14<\/sup>C = -171\u2030 to 22\u2030) and juvenile salmonids (\u0394<sup>14<\/sup>C = \u2212102\u2030 to 17\u2030) reflected a feeding history of both biofilm (~ 56%) and leaf litter (~ 40%). We estimate that in upper Herbert River on average 36% of the carbon incorporated into consumer biomass is derived from the glacier ecosystem. Thus, <sup>14<\/sup>C-depleted glacial organic carbon was likely transferred to higher trophic levels through a feeding history of bacterial uptake of dissolved organic carbon and subsequent consumption of <sup>14<\/sup>C-depleted biofilm by invertebrates and ultimately fish. Our findings show that the metazoan food web is sustained in part by glacial organic carbon such that future changes in glacial runoff could influence the stability and trophic structure of proglacial aquatic ecosystems.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5040dbe5e4b07a90c5ec1485"],"contacts":[{"name":"Jason Fellman","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Eran Hood","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Peter A.

Here we synthesize physical, chemical and biological linkages that characterize the northern PCTR ecosystem, with particular emphasis on the potential impacts of glacier change in the coastal mountain ranges on the surface\u2013water hydrology, biogeochemistry, coastal oceanography and aquatic ecology. We also evaluate the relative importance and interplay between interannual variability and long-term trends in key physical drivers and ecological responses. To advance our knowledge of the northern PCTR, we advocate for cross-disciplinary research bridging the icefield-to-ocean ecosystem that can be paired with long-term scientific records and designed to inform decisionmakers.","parentId":"5040dbe5e4b07a90c5ec1485","contacts":[{"name":"Shad R O'Neel","oldPartyId":7621,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"soneel@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Glaciologist","firstName":"Shad","middleName":"R","lastName":"O'Neel","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Alaska Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9077867150","officePhone":"9077867088","streetAddress":{"zip":"99508","city":"Anchorage","state":"AK","line1":"4210 University Drive"},"buildingCode":"WAW","name":"Shad R O'Neel\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"99508-4626","country":"USA","city":"Anchorage","state":"AK","line1":"4210 University Drive"},"building":"Glenn Olds Hall"}},{"name":"Eran Hood","oldPartyId":56214,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.","firstName":"Eran","lastName":"Hood","organization":{"displayText":"University of Alaska Southeast"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Allison L.

Characterizing DOC in Mendenhall Glacier outflow (southeast Alaska) we document a seasonal persistence to the radiocarbon-depleted signature of DOC, highlighting ancient DOC as a ubiquitous feature of glacier outflow. We observed no systematic depletion in&nbsp; \n<em>\u0394<\/em> &nbsp; 14 C-DOC with increasing discharge during the melt season that would suggest mobilization of an aged subglacial carbon store. However, DOC concentration,&nbsp; \n<em>\u03b4<\/em> &nbsp; 13 C-DOC,&nbsp; \n<em>\u0394<\/em> &nbsp; 14 C-DOC and fluorescence signatures appear to have been influenced by runoff from vegetated hillslopes above the glacier during onset and senescence of melt. In the peak glacier melt period, the&nbsp; \n<em>\u0394<\/em> &nbsp; 14 C-DOC of stream samples at the outflow (-181.7 to - 355.3\u2030) was comparable to the&nbsp; \n<em>\u0394<\/em> &nbsp; 14 C-DOC for snow samples from the accumulation zone (\u2212207.2 to \u2212390.9\u2030), suggesting that ancient DOC from the glacier surface is exported in glacier runoff. The pre-aged DOC in glacier snow and runoff is consistent with contributions from fossil fuel combustion sources similar to those documented previously in ice cores and thus provides evidence for anthropogenic perturbation of the carbon cycle. Overall, our results emphasize the need to further characterize DOC inputs to glacier ecosystems, particularly in light of predicted changes in glacier mass and runoff in the coming century.","parentId":"50461958e4b0241d49d62bb2","linkParentIds":["5040dbe5e4b07a90c5ec1485"],"contacts":[{"name":"Robert G M Spencer","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Woods Hole Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Andrew Vermilyea","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Castleton State College"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jason Fellman","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Alaska Southeast"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Peter Raymond","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Yale University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Aron Stubbins","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Skidaway Institute of Oceanography"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Durelle Scott","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Virginia Tech"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Eran Hood","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Alaska Southeast"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alaska CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/1748-9326\/9\/5\/055005","title":"Spencer et al. 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Mendenhall Glacier"},{"name":"Dissolved organic carbon (DOC)"},{"name":"glacier ecosystems"},{"name":"Glacier Runoff"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-05-08","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-08-28T14:00:01.825-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-20T12:07:53.488-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2014","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-08-28T14:00:01.825-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-20T12:07:53.488-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Environmental Research Letters","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issn","value":"1748-9326"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"volume","value":"9"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issue","value":"5"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"startPage","value":"055005"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1088\/1748-9326\/9\/5\/055005"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"journal article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Alaska CSC","parent_id":"4f831626e4b0e84f6086809b","people":["Robert G M Spencer","Andrew Vermilyea","Jason Fellman","Peter Raymond","Aron Stubbins","Durelle Scott","Eran Hood"],"orgs":["Alaska CSC"],"children":[]},"54dd2ab8e4b08de9379b31a9":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5040dbb0e4b07a90c5ec1418","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Storage and release of organic carbon from glaciers and ice sheets","relatedTitle":"Implications of Glacier Change in Alaska","id":"54dd2ab8e4b08de9379b31a9","relatedId":"5040dbb0e4b07a90c5ec1418","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/54dd2ab8e4b08de9379b31a9","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Implications of Glacier Change in Alaska","relatedTitle":"Storage and release of organic carbon from glaciers and ice sheets","id":"5040dbb0e4b07a90c5ec1418","relatedId":"54dd2ab8e4b08de9379b31a9","annotation":null}]},"id":"54dd2ab8e4b08de9379b31a9","title":"Storage and release of organic carbon from glaciers and ice sheets","body":"<p><span>Polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers, which cover roughly 11% of the Earth's land surface, store organic carbon from local and distant sources and then release it to downstream environments. Climate-driven changes to glacier runoff are expected to be larger than climate impacts on other components of the hydrological cycle, and may represent an important flux of organic carbon. A compilation of published data on dissolved organic carbon from glaciers across five continents reveals that mountain and polar glaciers represent a quantitatively important store of organic carbon. The Antarctic Ice Sheet is the repository of most of the roughly 6 petagrams (Pg) of organic carbon stored in glacier ice, but the annual release of glacier organic carbon is dominated by mountain glaciers in the case of dissolved organic carbon and the Greenland Ice Sheet in the case of particulate organic carbon. Climate change contributes to these fluxes: approximately 13% of the annual flux of glacier dissolved organic carbon is a result of glacier mass loss. These losses are expected to accelerate, leading to a cumulative loss of roughly 15 teragrams (Tg) of glacial dissolved organic carbon by 2050 due to climate change \u2014 equivalent to about half of the annual flux of dissolved organic carbon from the Amazon River. Thus, glaciers constitute a key link between terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes, and will be of increasing importance in land-to-ocean fluxes of organic carbon in glacierized regions.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["4ffae449e4b0c15d5ce9fadf","5040dbe5e4b07a90c5ec1485"],"contacts":[{"name":"Eran Hood","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Tom J.

Landscapes of Northern Alaska","body":"<div>\n<p>Permafrost \u2013 the thick layer of permanently frozen soil found in Arctic regions \u2013 has been thawing rapidly over the past century due to climate change. When permafrost thaws unevenly, it produces thermokarst landscapes, irregular surfaces of small hills interspersed with hollows. The processes that produce thermokarst can lead to significant changes within the surrounding ecosystems, altering water quality, vegetation, and water, carbon, and nutrient storage and flows. These changes can have substantial implications for fish and wildlife populations and disrupt rural communities and infrastructure.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThe goal of this project was to better understand the extent of thermokarst processes and the rate at which they are happening under climate change in northern Alaska. Researchers used a combination of mapping, literature review, and consultations with wildlife experts to assess thermokarst extent; possible impacts on fish, wildlife, and habitats; and the strengths and weaknesses of current and past efforts to monitor thermokarst. Researchers used these insights to develop and propose a plan for monitoring thermokarst on the North Slope of Alaska, a means to supply information that will build understanding of how climate change is reshaping the region\u2019s landscape and living things.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","purpose":"Thermokarst-related surface disturbance alters hydrology, carbon and nutrient flux, vegetation, stream sediment-loading, and consequently, fish and wildlife habitat use and population dynamics. Lake expansion accompanied by drainage, development of new drainage networks due to thawing ice wedges, and riverbank thaw slumps are examples of thermokarst processes that may be increasing in areal extent with climate change and could substantially affect fish and wildlife populations. However, the rate and extent of thermokarst-driven land surface change at the landscape scale is poorly quantified.\n\nProject researchers will review and consider current and past efforts to monitor thermokarst processes at broad spatial and temporal scales, compare scale-relevance, costs, and strengths\/weaknesses of the various approaches and techniques. Researchers will then outline potential study designs for monitoring thermokarst events that emphasize processes affecting large areas, or with a disproportionately large impact on fish and wildlife habitat quality. Specifically, we will 1) review existing thermokarst monitoring methods via a literature review, 2) provide a brief description and review of thermokarst landforms and processes associated with permafrost degradation typical of northern Alaska, 3) describe the landscape settings associated with each type, form, or process, 4) quantify the rate and cumulative area of such features in northern Alaska, 5) conduct a literature review to identify the ways in which fish, wildlife, and habitat resources may be impacted by thermokarst-affected landscapes, and 6) describe possible study designs (including novel approaches) and required sample sizes for a thermokarst monitoring program on the North

conditions on the Alaskan Arctic Coastal Plain using ground penetrating radar and TerraSAR-X satellite data","body":"Arctic freshwater ecosystems have responded rapidly to climatic changes over the last half century. Lakes and rivers are experiencing a thinning of the seasonal ice cover, which may increase potential over-wintering freshwater habitat, winter water supply for industrial withdrawal, and permafrost degradation. Here, we combined the use of ground penetrating radar (GPR) and high-resolution (HR) spotlight TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite data (1.25 m resolution) to identify and characterize floating ice and grounded ice conditions in lakes, ponds, beaded stream pools, and an alluvial river channel. Classified ice conditions from the GPR and the TSX data showed excellent agreement: 90.6% for a predominantly floating ice lake, 99.7% for a grounded ice lake, 79.0% for a beaded stream course, and 92.1% for the alluvial river channel. A GIS-based analysis of 890 surface water features larger than 0.01 ha showed that 42% of the total surface water area potentially provided over-wintering habitat during the 2012\/2013 winter. Lakes accounted for 89% of this area, whereas the alluvial river channel accounted for 10% and ponds and beaded stream pools each accounted for &lt;1%. Identification of smaller landscape features such as beaded stream pools may be important because of their distribution and role in connecting other water bodies on the landscape. These findings advance techniques for detecting and knowledge associated with potential winter habitat distribution for fish and invertebrates at the local scale in a region of the Arctic with increasing stressors related to climate and land use change.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5086e376e4b0a1435286ddfb"],"contacts":[{"name":"Benjamin M.

In the course of studying vegetation and permafrost-terrain characteristics along a chronosequence of tundra burn sites from AD 1977, 1993, and 2007 on the North Slope of Alaska, we discovered two large, previously unrecognized tundra fires. The Meade River fire burned an estimated 500 km2 and the Ketik River fire burned an estimated 1200 km2. Based on radiocarbon dating of charred twigs, analysis of historic aerial photography, and regional climate proxy data, these fires likely occurred between AD 1880 and 1920. Together, these events double the estimated burn area on the North Slope of Alaska over the last ~100 to 130 years. Assessment of vegetation succession along the century-scale chronosequence of tundra fire disturbances demonstrates for the first time on the North Slope of Alaska that tundra fires can facilitate the invasion of tundra by shrubs. Degradation of ice-rich permafrost was also evident at the fire sites and likely aided in the presumed changes of the tundra vegetation postfire. Other previously unrecognized tundra fire events likely exist in Alaska and other Arctic regions and identification of these sites is important for better understanding disturbance regimes and carbon cycling in Arctic tundra.","parentId":"5086e376e4b0a1435286ddfb","contacts":[{"name":"Benjamin M Jones","oldPartyId":5187,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"bjones@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Remote Sensing Scientist","personalTitle":"Mr.","firstName":"Benjamin","middleName":"M","lastName":"Jones","organization":{"displayText":"Alaska Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"9077867033","streetAddress":{"zip":"99508-4626","country":"US","city":"Anchorage","state":"AK","line1":"4210 University Drive"},"buildingCode":"WAW","name":"Benjamin M Jones\/GEOG\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"99508-4626","country":"USA","city":"Anchorage","state":"AK","line1":"4210 University Drive"},"building":"Glenn Olds Hall"}},{"name":"Amy L.

Their dynamic states are seldom investigated, despite their importance for landscape stability, hydrology, nutrient fluxes, and carbon cycling. Here we report results based on high-resolution Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements using space-borne data for a study area located on the North Slope of Alaska near Prudhoe Bay, where we focus on the seasonal thaw settlement within DTLBs, averaged between 2006 and 2010. The majority (14) of the 18 DTLBs in the study area exhibited seasonal thaw settlement of 3\u20134 cm. However, four of the DTLBs examined exceeded 4 cm of thaw settlement, with one basin experiencing up to 12 cm. Combining the InSAR observations with the in situ active layer thickness measured using ground penetrating radar and mechanical probing, we calculated thaw strain, an index of thaw settlement strength along a transect across the basin that underwent large thaw settlement. We found thaw strains of 10\u201335% at the basin center, suggesting the seasonal melting of ground ice as a possible mechanism for the large settlement. These findings emphasize the dynamic nature of permafrost landforms, demonstrate the capability of the InSAR technique to remotely monitor surface deformation of individual DTLBs, and illustrate the combination of ground-based and remote sensing observations to estimate thaw strain. Our study highlights the need for better description of the spatial heterogeneity of landscape-scale processes for regional assessment of surface dynamics on Arctic coastal lowlands.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5086e376e4b0a1435286ddfb"],"contacts":[{"name":"Lin Liu","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Kevin Schaefer","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Alessio Gusmeroli","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Guido Grosse","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Benjamin M.

Here we describe the distribution of thermokarst landforms in the continuous permafrost zone of Arctic Alaska, analyze linkages to the underlying surficial geology, and discuss the vulnerability of different types of landscapes to future thaw. We identified nine major thermokarst landforms and then mapped their distributions in twelve representative study areas totaling 300-km<\/span><sup>2<\/sup><span>. These study areas differ in their geologic history, permafrost-ice content, and ground thermal regime. Results show that 63% of the entire study area is occupied by thermokarst landforms and that the distribution of thermokarst landforms and overall landscape complexity varies markedly with surficial geology. Areas underlain by ice-rich marine silt are the most affected by thermokarst (97% of total area), whereas areas underlain by glacial drift are least affected (14%). Drained thermokarst-lake basins are the most widespread thermokarst landforms, covering 33% of the entire study region, with greater prevalence in areas of marine silt (48% coverage), marine sand (47%), and aeolian silt (34%). Thermokarst-lakes are the second most common thermokarst landform, covering 16% of the study region, with highest coverage in areas underlain by marine silt (39% coverage). Thermokarst troughs and pits cover 7% of the study region and are the third most prevalent thermokarst landform. They are most common in areas underlain by deltaic sands and gravels (18% coverage) and marine sand (12%). Alas valleys are widespread in areas of aeolian silt (14%) located in gradually sloping uplands. Areas of marine silt have been particularly vulnerable to thaw in the past because they are ice-rich and have low-gradient topography facilitating the repeated development of thermokarst-lakes. In the future, ice-rich aeolian, upland terrain (yedoma) will be particularly susceptible to thaw because it still contains massive concentrations of ground ice in the form of syngenetic ice-wedges that have remained largely intact since the Pleistocene.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5086e376e4b0a1435286ddfb","503fab88e4b09851b69ab40c"],"contacts":[{"name":"Louise Farquharson","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Dan H Mann","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Guido Grosse","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Benjamin M.

These fish have large ranges \u2013 spending part of their lives in the ocean and part in freshwater streams \u2013 and they require specific environmental conditions to survive, migrate, and reproduce. For these reasons, Pacific lamprey and Pacific eulachon are likely threatened by a variety of climate change impacts to both their ocean and freshwater habitats. However, to date, little research has explored these impacts, despite the importance of these species to tribal communities.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThis project will evaluate the effects of future climate change on Pacific lamprey and Pacific eulachon populations used as food sources by Native American tribes in the Pacific Northwest. Researchers will examine changes to both ocean conditions and freshwater habitats, providing an overall picture of what climate change may mean for these fish populations\u2019 health. This assessment will provide critical information for tribes preparing for changes to these food sources as well as state and federal agencies concerned with managing these populations.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<strong>This project is jointly supported by the Northwest Climate Science Center, the Alaska Climate Science Center, and the North Pacific Landscape Conservation Cooperative.<\/strong><\/div>\n","purpose":"Pacific Lamprey and Pacific Eulachon are important \"first food\" sources of Pacific Northwest Native Americans. These fish are already limited by a number of factors (habitat changes, temperature fluctuations, and migration timing changes) and are being considered for protection by management agencies. Under a changing climate, these fish are likely to be impacted both by changes to ocean conditions and food availability and freshwater habitat because of their life histories. Little research today has assessed the magnitude or nature of these impacts on these two species, despite their importance to tribes. This project will evaluate the impacts of future climate change scenarios on the survival and viability of Pacific lamprey and Pacific eulachon populations that are used as food sources by the Native American tribes of the Columbia River Basin and coastal areas of Washington and Oregon. This evaluation will couple projected changes to ocean conditions and to freshwater habitat and consider the effects of these changes on the life cycles of these fish populations. With matching funding, this project will expand the analysis to also include select anadromous salmonid populations of importance to the Columbia River tribes.\n\nThis project is jointly supported by the Northwest Climate Science Center, the Alaska Climate Science Center, and the North Pacific Landscape Conservation Cooperative.

Berries supply essential nutrients that prevent heart disease and cancer, are used for medicinal purposes, and are the only sweet food in the traditional Native diet. Hence, berries have both nutritional and cultural significance.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> From 2008 to 2012, wild berry populations in the Chugach region were decimated by an unexpected outbreak of moths, thought to have been brought about by shifting climate (i.e., warmer temperatures allowed a greater number of moths to survive the winter). This outbreak amounted to a total loss of blueberry and salmonberry harvests during these years, jeopardizing a tribal for-profit enterprise in the region. It also led to a need to restore berry production and to prepare for future threats from damaging insects.\n <br> \n <br> The goal of this project was to create maps and models that would help tribal and other land managers identify prime areas for berry restoration. Researchers used a variety of information sources, including remote sensing imagery, field data, and local tribal knowledge, to develop and verify these products. The resulting maps and models are helping tribal forest managers and local landowners target their berry restoration efforts where they are most likely to be successful and protected from future insect outbreaks, contributing to the reestablishment and future resilience of wild berry populations.\n <br> \n <br> \n <strong>This project was jointly supported by the Northwest Climate Science Center, the Alaska Climate Science Center, and the North Pacific Landscape Conservation Cooperative.<\/strong>\n<\/div>","purpose":"After a series of defoliation events from Geometrid moths from 2008 to 2012, defoliators not previously recorded by western science or remembered in tribal history, which lead to a total loss of blueberry and salmon berry subsistence harvests during those years our tribes were determined to restore and improve berry production. The Goal of our project was to develop predictive models to identify potential blueberry habitat on the southern tip the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska using model predictions, field data, and local knowledge.  Our project was successfully able to model and predict optimum blueberry habitat on the southern tip of the Kenai Peninsula Alaska.  We utilized Landsat imagery, digital elevation models, vegetation data, locally collected field data, and local tribal knowledge to build and verify the models.  We were not able to successfully develop a windthrow risk model.  These models will enable our Tribes to better manage the forest for blueberry resources especially in the face of a changing climate.  By identifying potential high quality blueberry habitat, berry habitat improvement treatments can be targeted in areas where treatments have the highest likelihood of being effective.  Treatments will result in more healthy and resilient blueberry picking areas.\n\nThis project is jointly supported by the Northwest Climate Science Center, the Alaska Climate Science Center, and the North Pacific Landscape Conservation Cooperative.","parentId":"52ab6f5ae4b078ad3e41b120","linkParentIds":["5238c2d0e4b0c7d45ef072bc"],"contacts":[{"name":"Nathan Lojewski","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"Nathan@chugachmiut.org","organization":{"displayText":"Chugachmiut Tribal Consortium"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alaska CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"North Pacific LCC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"John Lundquist","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USDA Forest Service"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Robin M.

Perspectives of Alaska\u2019s environmental managers on trends in wild berry abundance","body":"Background. Wild berries are a valued traditional food in Alaska. Phytochemicals in wild berries may contribute to the prevention of vascular disease, cancer and cognitive decline, making berry consumption important to community health in rural areas. Little was known regarding which species of berries were important to Alaskan communities, the number of species typically picked in communities and whether recent environmental change has affected berry abundance or quality.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> Objective. To identify species of wild berries that were consumed by people in different ecological regions of Alaska and to determine if perceived berry abundance was changing for some species or in some regions.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> Design. We asked tribal environmental managers throughout Alaska for their views on which among 12 types of wild berries were important to their communities and whether berry harvests over the past decade were different than in previous years. We received responses from 96 individuals in 73 communities.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> Results. Berries that were considered very important to communities differed among ecological regions of Alaska. Low-bush blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum and V. caespitosum), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) and salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis) were most frequently identified as very important berries for communities in the boreal, polar and maritime ecoregions, respectively. For 7 of the 12 berries on the survey, a majority of respondents indicated that in the past decade abundance had either declined or become more variable.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> Conclusions. Our study is an example of how environmental managers and participants in local observer networks can report on the status of wild resources in rural Alaska. Their observations suggest that there have been changes in the productivity of some wild berries in the past decade, resulting in greater uncertainty among communities regarding the security of berry harvests. Monitoring and experimental studies are needed to determine how environmental change may affect berry abundance.","parentId":"52fa2d26e4b02baefb048e0a","contacts":[{"name":"Jerry

Alaskan Coastal Forest Watersheds","body":"<div>The flow of water is often highlighted as a priority in land management planning and assessments. A recent evaluation of climate impacts to freshwater aquatic systems identified water as a key supporting ecosystem service. Reduced snowfall and snowpack, earlier spring runoff, increased winter streamflow and flooding, and decreased summer streamflow were identified as potential impacts due to climate change. These factors all have close links to the water balance in the perhumid coastal temperate rainforest (PCTR). The improved measurement and modeling of water is required to develop predictive estimates for plant distributions, soil moisture, and snowpack, which all play important roles in ecosystem planning in the face of climate change. The goal of this project is to develop a spatially explicit groundwater prediction model. Using remote sensing, digital elevation models, GIS, and spatial analysis techniques we will create a data framework to support multi-faceted hydrologic modeling at the landscape scale. The primary data deliverable will be a viable wetness index validated with an extensive soil water measurement records. The index will be used to identify zones of soil moisture accumulation and flow routing to stream networks and provide a critical input variable for informing and testing the <a

Alaska Perhumid Coastal Temperate Rainforest (AKPCTR_DEM)","body":"AKPCTR_DEM is a 50-meter resolution, bare-earth digital elevation model (DEM) in raster (geotiff) format. The perhumid (wettest) region of the North American coastal temperate rainforest (PCTR) extends along the coast of British Columbia and southeast Alaska between approximately 50.57 and 59.6 degrees north latitude.The extent of this dataset includes all of the Alaska and Canada watersheds that discharge into southeast Alaska coastal waters, which covers essentially the northern half of the PCTR. **General Methods:** Using Desktop ArcGIS version 10.3.1, the following three elevation datasets were combined to create a continuous DEM for the Alaska perhumid coastal temperate rainforest (AKPCTR) watersheds: 1) The 2-arc-second, 1:63360, [USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED)](http:\/usgs.seamless.gov), downloaded 12\/4\/2008. Horizontal datum=NAD83; vertical datum=NGVD29; map units=decimal degrees; elevation units=meters. [Note: the term \"3DEP\" has replaced \"NED.\"] 2) The 25-meter resolution, 1:20,000 British Columbia Terrain Resource Information Management (TRIM) DEM, downloaded 9\/4\/2009. Horizontal datum=NAD83; vertical datum=CGVD28; projection=BC Albers; map units=meters; elevation units=meters. 3) The 0.75-arc-second, 1:50,000 [Canadian Digital Elevation Data (CDED)](ftp:\/\/ftp2.cits.rncan.gc.ca\/pub\/geobase\/official\/cded\/50k_dem\/) DEM for the Yukon Territory, downloaded 8\/11\/2015. Horizontal datum=NAD83; vertical datum=CGVD28; map units=decimal degrees; elevation units=meters. The 3 DEMs were projected to a common coordinate system, resolution, and registration. The Canadian TRIM and CDED datasets were combined, then a program called \u201cMerge\u201d was used to join the Canada DEM to the NED. The different processing methods, scales, and vertical datums used to produce the source U.S. and Canada DEMs result in a visible seam where the 2 datasets are joined. The \u201cMerge\u201d program creates a smooth transition along the seam between the NED and Canada DEMs (see process steps for details). Portions of the NED for Southeast Alaska have been updated with higher-resolution IfSAR and LiDAR data; however the vertical datum for this newer data is based on NAVD88. Using the updated portions of the NED would result in an AKPCTR DEM containing a mix of NAVD88, NGVD29, and CGVD28 elevations. There are no datum converters for Alaska to easily transform between NAVD88 and NGVD29 or CGVD28. To avoid the mix of vertical datums and to be more consistent with adjacent Canadian elevations in CGVD28, the older version of the NED (pre-LiDAR and IfSAR) was used. Source data for the Alaska and Canada DEMs range from the 1940's to 2002.","purpose":"AKPCTR_DEM provides elevation values of the bare-earth surface for use in analysis, mapping, and display. The original motivation for developing this dataset was to support research studies focused on the Alaska perhumid coastal temperate rainforest. This layer was specifically created for projects needing continuous DEM coverage of the United States\/Canada transboundary drainage area for southeast Alaska.","parentId":"5313a67ae4b0123ceff009aa","contacts":[{"name":"Frances

for the Alaska Perhumid Coastal Temperate Rainforest","body":"These files include a derived 50 meter spatial resolution Compound Topographic (or Wetness) Index ([CTI or TWI](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Topographic_Wetness_Index)) and Flow Accumulation (as represented by specific catchment area, SCA) calculated from a continuous, transboundary DEM developed across the Alaska perhumid coastal temperate rainforest (AKPCTR). The extent of this dataset includes all of the Alaska and Canada watersheds that discharge into southeast Alaska coastal waters, which covers essentially the northern half of the full PCTR. The transboundary DEM used to calculate the CTI can be here: [link](http:\/\/ckan.snap.uaf.edu\/dataset\/a-continuous-transboundary-50-meter-dem-for-the-alaska-perhumid-coastal-temperate-rainforest-ak06b59) Flow accumulation is represented by a grid of specific catchment area (SCA), which is the contributing area per unit contour length using the multiple flow direction D-infinity approach. Unit contour length is equal to the DEM resolution of 50 meters. **There are two versions of both the CTI and SCA provided:** *CTI_AKPCTR_NoFlowMask.tif and SCA_AKPCTR_NoFlowMask.tif* This is the resulting CTI file when no masks are applied to the study area before the CTI procedure is run. After the CTI procedure is run, all glacial areas are masked out, as CTI is not meaningful over glaciers. *CTI_AKPCTR_FlowMask.tif and SCA_AKPCTR_FlowMask.tif* This is the resulting CTI file where prior to running the CTI procedure, we apply a mask across all active glaciers and all downslope cells receiving flow from glacially affected cells. These masked cells are excluded from the CTI procedure. This results in fewer CTI values on the landscape. This dataset is provided to identify cells in the direct downslope path of glaciers because CTI values for cells receiving upslope accumulation from glaciers may not be reliable due to uncertainties in surface water flowpaths in glaciated areas. **Processing Steps:** 1. Using the pitremove function from [TAUDEM](http:\/\/hydrology.usu.edu\/taudem\/taudem5\/index.html), filled sinks in the DEM following the method of Planchon and Darboux (2001). 2. (For **_FlowMask* versions only) Mask out glacial areas and associated downslope cells. Prior to calculating flow direction and flow accumulation, change cells in the filled DEM to NoData where glaciers exist, using the [Randolph Glacier Inventory version 5.0](https:\/\/www.glims.org\/RGI\/rgi50_dl.html) raster dataset to identify the presence of glaciers. Cells downslope from the masked glaciers will then also be identified as NoData in subsequent processing and the final CTI raster. Compute D-infinity slopes and flow direction and flow accumulation (as specific catchment area) rasters from the filled DEM using TAUDEM D-infinity method. As part of the D-infinity routine, TauDEM uses the method of Garbrecht &amp; Martz (1997) to resolve flats. 3. The D-infinity slope raster was modified in the following way: if slope = 0, then change slope value to 0.0001; otherwise leave slope value unchanged. This was done to avoid dividing by zero when calculating CTI. 4. Compute Compound Topographic Index (CTI) using these steps: `Dsca` = D-infinity specific catchment area raster `Dslp` = D-infinity slope raster Then, CTI = `Ln(Dsca\/Dslp)` 5. Clip the CTI raster to the Alaska perhumid coastal temperate rainforest (AKPCTR) watershed boundary.","purpose":"The motivation for developing this dataset was to support research studies focused on the Alaska perhumid coastal temperate rainforest.

Change on Moose and Caribou Habitat in Alaska","body":"<div>Moose and caribou are two very important animals to both subsistence and sport hunting economies in Alaska. Their survival and reproduction is dependent on sufficient winter habitat and food sources, which may be threatened by climate change.<br>\n<br>\nDuring the winter, caribou eat lichens (organisms made up of algae and fungus) that grow on the snow-covered ground. Lichens will likely have a complex response to climate change, affected in different ways by factors like changing precipitation, wildfire, and competition with plants. For example, as temperatures warm, there will likely be less snow cover, exposing more of the lichen to caribou. Simultaneously, increased fire frequency could reduce lichen availability.<br>\n<br>\nMoose, on the other hand, eat the twigs of deciduous shrubs that stick up above the snow. Unlike lichen, shrub habitats may actually be affected positively by increased fire. Warmer temperatures and less snow are also likely to increase shrub biomass.<br>\n<br>\nProject researchers are using the <a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/display-project\/4f831626e4b0e84f6086809b\/503faaa3e4b09851b69ab403\">Alaska Integrated Ecosystem Model<\/a> to unravel some of these complex relationships and estimate the effects of climate change on food availability for these two species throughout most of Alaska and parts of Canada (from about 1970-2100). The resulting maps will be divided by land ownership and landscape characteristics to show expected changes in winter food for moose and caribou that will be tailored to and directly useable by natural resource managers as they devise strategies for adapting to a changing climate. &nbsp;<\/div>\n","purpose":"Climate change is a complex process that may affect the food resources of different species of wildlife in contrasting ways. Moose and caribou are important to both subsistence and sport hunting economies throughout Alaska, but their winter diets are quite different; caribou focus on snow covered ground hugging lichens while moose focus on the twigs of erect deciduous shrubs that protrude above the snow. This project will use output from the Integrated Ecosystem Model to estimate the differential effects of climate change on the quantity of food available to these two species throughout most of Alaska and parts of Canada, ~1970-2100. The model integrates the expected effects of climate on lichen and shrub production, wildfire and resulting plant community change, and the restrictions to food availability caused by deep snow and ground icing as a result of rain-on-snow. The results will be stratified by land ownership and landscape characteristics to provide maps of expected changes in winter food for moose and caribou that will be tailored to and directly useable by natural resource managers as they devise strategies for adapting to a changing climate.

thermokarst landscapes","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/ncomms13043):&nbsp;Thermokarst is the process whereby the thawing of ice-rich permafrost ground causes land subsidence, resulting in development of distinctive landforms. Accelerated thermokarst due to climate change will damage infrastructure, but also impact hydrology, ecology and biogeochemistry. Here, we present a circumpolar assessment of the distribution of thermokarst landscapes, defined as landscapes comprised of current thermokarst landforms and areas susceptible to future thermokarst development. At 3.6 \u00d7 106&nbsp;km2, thermokarst landscapes are estimated to cover&nbsp;\u223c20% of the northern permafrost region, with approximately equal contributions from three landscape types where characteristic wetland, lake and hillslope thermokarst landforms occur. We estimate that approximately half of the below-ground organic carbon within the study region is stored in thermokarst landscapes. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly considering thermokarst when assessing impacts of climate change, including future landscape greenhouse gas emissions, and provide a means for assessing such impacts at the circumpolar scale.","parentId":"521244dde4b08b85aab612c7","contacts":[{"name":"D.

Alaska provides important breeding ground for hundreds of migratory bird species that travel thousands of miles in their annual migrations between breeding and wintering spots.<br>\n<br>\nUnderstanding how climate and land use changes affect migratory bird populations is crucial; however this information is also very difficult to collect. Migration routes expose birds to a wide range of landscapes and habitats, which are often experiencing varying degrees of climate and land use change (e.g. warmer temperatures or increased housing developments). Moreover, climate change in the future may cause bird populations to shift their migration patterns, adding even more complexity. Visible impacts to bird populations are the cumulative result of many factors, giving researchers a major challenge when trying to pinpoint the most important threats.<br>\n<br>\nAs an important step towards unraveling these different threats to migratory birds, this project will define a large-scale multi-region strategy to help prioritize and guide future research. The researchers will use literature reviews, surveys, and coordination with other researchers and managers to identify the major gaps in our understanding.

The effects of climate and land use on their survival and productivity varies along the migratory routes and population trends result from the cumulative effects of habitat quality and climate throughout their annual range. It is unlikely that the direction or strength of climate and habitat change are consistent among ranges and, as a result, it is extremely difficult to unravel the most important effects on population size when potentially contrasting positive and negative influences of climate and habitat occur within a year at widely separated locations. A very large scale research framework or strategy is needed to deal with the complexity of this problem and increase the relevance, efficiency and effectiveness of research studies and resulting management. Using an intensive review of the scientific literature to identify knowledge gaps and a survey of expert opinions of researchers and managers this project will identify what types of information are most critical for the development of a focused and integrated multi-regional research program and the best ways for researchers and managers from seasonal ranges to communicate in common terms.","parentId":"55130bb3e4b02e76d75c0748","contacts":[{"name":"Brad Griffith","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"ffdbg@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Alaska Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"9074745067","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"99775-7020","country":"USA","city":"Fairbanks","state":"AK","line1":"209 Irving I Bldg, P.O.

Because life history requirements and the timing of migration varies among migrant guilds and species, and because climate change is heterogeneous throughout North America (IPCC 2007) it is unlikely that the direction or magnitude of climate effects, or non-climate stressors for that matter, on the seasonal habitats (breeding, stopover, wintering) of any species or guild is consistent.  Climate change may be beneficial on one seasonal range, detrimental on another and the cumulative effects across annual life cycles and decades may not be known unless there is a coordinated and focused effort to integrate research across the entire annual range of a migrant or group of migrants, i.e., across multiple CSCs.  Population trends result from the sequential cumulative effects of habitat quality and mortality sources on survival and fecundity schedules as migrants traverse their annual routes from year to year.  Seasonal use areas ignore administrative boundaries and habitat quality and mortality factors in each of the seasonal use areas of migrants affects energy balance, productivity and survival (performance) but explicit pathways, nature (additive, multiplicative), relative strengths and sum of effects are generally unknown.  This project will employ 1) an intensive literature review to a) identify knowledge gaps in regard to waterfowl life histories and potential strength an direction of climate effects on their seasonal ranges; 2) a questionnaire survey of researchers and managers from seasonal ranges to identify most critically needed life history and habitat information from adjacent ranges (i.e., breeding, stopover, wintering) and an assessment of the relative strength of climate and non-climate stressors on seasonal and annual waterfowl performance; 3) a special session at a regional\/national meeting to summarize, discuss and refine the results of 1 and 2 into a draft research framework that emphasizes common and transferrable variables of appropriate temporal and spatial scale. The draft research framework will be distributed to cooperators\/partners for review and comment and ultimately published in a peer reviewed journal such as Environmental Management.

The project will develop robust methods for hydrologic modeling that will be applicable throughout AK and WA, including areas lacking types of on-the-ground measurements traditionally required for this type of research. Beyond improving theoretical understanding of glacier-influenced hydrology and building operational tools for other scientists, this project helps citizens of AK and WA by providing improved historical and projected statistics of streamflow to land resource managers and private citizens alike. This will be done by sharing the software and raw data of the modeling process through internet-standard protocols and developing a web portal specifically designed to allow users to explore content, access data, and view results through map-based and statistical visualizations. This will help the general population understand (1) the state of available resources, (2) potential responses of hydrology to changes in climate and glacier extent, and (3) uncertainty of model simulations associated with use of historical and projected future climate data. The development of this information can support the assessment of potential hazards (such as ice dam failures) and decision-making for more resilient development and risk management. &nbsp; <\/div>","parentId":"55130c4fe4b02e76d75c0755","linkParentIds":["4ffae449e4b0c15d5ce9fadf","55130bb3e4b02e76d75c0748"],"contacts":[{"name":"Roland Viger","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"rviger@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Geographer","firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Viger","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Branch of Regional Research, Central Region"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"3032365034","officePhone":"3035413075","streetAddress":{"zip":"80309","city":"Boulder","state":"CO","line1":"3215 Marine St, Bldg 6"},"buildingCode":"KDG","name":"Roland Viger\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80303","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"412","city":"Boulder","state":"CO","line1":"3215 Marine Street, Suite E-127, Mail Stop 412"},"building":"University of Colorado - Building 6"}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alaska CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Lauren E Hay","oldPartyId":4344,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"lhay@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Hydrologist","firstName":"Lauren","middleName":"E","lastName":"Hay","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Branch of Regional Research, Central Region"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"3032365034","officePhone":"3032367279","streetAddress":{"zip":"80225","city":"Lakewood","state":"CO","line1":"W 6th Ave Kipling St"},"buildingCode":"KAH","name":"Lauren E Hay\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80225-0046","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"412","city":"Denver","state":"CO","line1":"Box 25046, Denver Federal Center, Mail Stop 412"},"building":"DFC Bldg 53"}},{"name":"Steven L Markstrom","oldPartyId":6505,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"markstro@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Hydrologist","firstName":"Steven","middleName":"L","lastName":"Markstrom","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Branch of Regional Research, Central Region"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"3032365034","officePhone":"3032363330","streetAddress":{"zip":"80225","city":"Lakewood","state":"CO","line1":"W 6th Ave Kipling St"},"buildingCode":"KAH","name":"Steven L Markstrom\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80225-0046","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"412","city":"Denver","state":"CO","line1":"Box 25046, Denver Federal Center, Mail Stop 412"},"building":"DFC Bldg 53"}},{"name":"Robert Steven Regan","oldPartyId":40010,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from FPPS data from 1992 through 2009.","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"Steven","lastName":"Regan","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Branch of Regional Research, Central Region"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Gregory J McCabe","oldPartyId":6652,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"gmccabe@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Physical Scientist","firstName":"Gregory","middleName":"J","lastName":"McCabe","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Branch of Regional Research, Central Region"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"3032365034","officePhone":"3032367278","streetAddress":{"zip":"80225","city":"Lakewood","state":"CO","line1":"W 6th Ave Kipling St"},"buildingCode":"KAH","name":"Gregory J Mccabe\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80225-0046","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"413","city":"Denver","state":"CO","line1":"Box 25046, Denver Federal Center, Mail Stop 413"},"building":"DFC Bldg 53"}},{"name":"Jacob H LaFontaine","oldPartyId":5799,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"jlafonta@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Hydrologist","personalTitle":"Mr.","firstName":"Jacob","middleName":"H","lastName":"LaFontaine","cellPhone":"6786182644","organization":{"displayText":"Georgia Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"6789246710","officePhone":"6789246664","streetAddress":{"zip":"30093","city":"Norcross","state":"GA","line1":"1770 Corporate Drive Suite 500"},"buildingCode":"AYE","name":"Jacob H LaFontaine\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"30360-2824","country":"USA","city":"Atlanta","state":"GA","line1":"3039 Amwiler Road, Suite 130"},"building":"GA WSC & SE Rex Offices"}},{"name":"Ashley E.

In particular, changes in seasonal snowcover and glacier volume have the potential to change the amount and timing of freshwater delivery to the ocean. Climate change will also impact the amount and timing of nutrients delivered by streams to near-shore habitats. As glaciers change, so will the runoff that is a primary driver for coastal currents that contribute to vibrant nearshore marine ecosystems. The potential impacts on economically important species such as herring and salmon are poorly understood, but we do know that the wellbeing of many species is linked to physical processes and climate. Improving our understanding of these linkages will help resource managers to make better long-term decisions with regard to managing ecosystems along the Gulf of Alaska. Other potential impacts of glacier loss include changing coastal viewsheds, which impacts tourism and recreation industries. Providing decision support to plan for these changes requires interagency collaborations, cross-disciplinary research and technical tools that enable data integration across space and time. Our work will provide a data-backed foundation by which we can assess snow and ice in coastal Alaska, and contribute to informed decision making regarding our resources.

Additionally, as glacier retreat changes Alaska\u2019s coastal viewsheds, tourism and recreation industries will be affected, and industries dependent on reliable seasonal snowpacks, such as ski recreation, are likely to suffer if predictions of increased winter rain manifest. Our project, Ice2O, will focus on integrating several newly available data products that can be combined to allow us to begin to develop forecasting decision-making tools related to cryospheric and hydrological change throughout the PCTR. These tools, leveraging the inter-agency collaborations we have established, will ultimately help address projected climate and ecosystem changes over multiple temporal and spatial scales. \r\nIce2O will integrate climate downscaling, snow accumulation, glacier mass balance and streamflow datasets, and then use the integrated database to assess glacier sensitivity to changes in climate forcing.  We will perform the analysis at the basin scale, but integrate over the entire northern PCTR region.  The sensitivity testing will be guided by colleagues in resource management (including LCC\u2019s, USFS, NPS, BLM) and ecology (including colleagues at the UAF School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences and the USGS) in order to align our efforts with the \u201cquestions that matter\u201d, that is those with large uncertainty and\/or substantial management and economic impacts. By building on an observational foundation, and by incorporating external ecosystem expertise, we will enhance model accuracy and provide relevant, accurate information on glacier change in the PCTR to to decision-makers. Our results will be presented in multiple formats to best facilitate engagement with both the science and management communities. The Ice2O team is diverse, with backgrounds in physical, chemical and biological science. We have a proven track-record of working with management, highlighting the existing and potential ecosystem-wide implications of glacier change. Each member of our team brings many other funded projects with them, allowing this project to focus on integrating a broad array of new discovery.\r\n"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award

(from&nbsp;http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0309170815002444):&nbsp;The northern portion of the Pacific coastal temperate rainforest (PCTR) is one of the least anthropogenically modified regions on earth and remains in many respects a frontier area to science. Rivers crossing the northern PCTR, which is also an international boundary region between British Columbia, Canada and Alaska, USA, deliver large freshwater and biogeochemical fluxes to the Gulf of Alaska and establish linkages between coastal and continental ecosystems. We evaluate interannual flow variability in three transboundary PCTR watersheds in response to El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). Historical hydroclimatic datasets from both Canada and the USA are analyzed using an up-to-date methodological suite accommodating both seasonally transient and highly nonlinear teleconnections. We find that streamflow teleconnections occur over particular seasonal windows reflecting the intersection of specific atmospheric and terrestrial hydrologic processes. The strongest signal is a snowmelt-driven flow timing shift resulting from ENSO- and PDO-associated temperature anomalies. Autumn rainfall runoff is also modulated by these climate modes, and a glacier-mediated teleconnection contributes to a late-summer ENSO-flow association. Teleconnections between AO and freshet flows reflect corresponding temperature and precipitation anomalies. A coherent NPGO signal is not clearly evident in streamflow. Linear and monotonically nonlinear teleconnections were widely identified, with less evidence for the parabolic effects that can play an important role elsewhere. The streamflow teleconnections did not vary greatly between hydrometric stations, presumably reflecting broad similarities in watershed characteristics. These results establish a regional foundation for both transboundary water management and studies of long-term hydroclimatic and environmental change.","parentId":"55159a69e4b03238427817c2","contacts":[{"name":"Sean W.

the Arctic.&nbsp; These activities, in turn, supplement a growing body of work that provides guidance for communities, resource managers and decision makers tasked with anticipating and adapting to climate.&nbsp; However, information related to these activities is dispersed across many technical publications, and is often not readily accessible to those outside the research community.&nbsp; As a result, the AK CSC is working with the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Dr. Gary Kofinas to develop a summary of the \u201cstate of our knowledge\u201d regarding climate change adaptation and resilience in Arctic communities.&nbsp; Ultimately, this summary will be published as a chapter in the forthcoming Arctic Resilience Assessment. &nbsp;This summary addresses several critical needs

Alaskan Forests and Ecotones","body":"Models built to project future vegetation changes given climate change frequently rely on gridded observed climate to establish the relationships between climate variables and ecological responses such as tree species\u2019 presence \/ absence, tree growth, establishment, and other demographic and physiological responses. However, gridded historical climate in Alaska relies heavily on both a sparse network of observations and generalized assumptions about temperature lapse rates with elevation that do not account for Alaska\u2019s extreme topography and climatic gradients. Much of what is known about tree responses from individual growth to species distributions therefore comes from assumed climatic relationships that have rarely, if ever, been verified with direct observation; such observations are only available at a handful of sites such as the Caribou \/ Poker Creek site and Bonanza Creek Long Term Ecological Research facility. We have established a network of forest and treeline sites from the wet, comparatively warm southeast Alaska perhumid rain forest, the transitional boral forest in southcentral Alaska, and the limits of tree distribution in the boreal forest and northwestern Alaska. The aims of this project are to provide observations of climate (including, but not limited to air temperature, surface temperature and snowpack duration, soil temperature) and co-located ecological responses (including, but not limited to tree establishment, sap flux, and tree growth) in order to better establish the direct effects of climate on ecological processes than species \/ climate associations alone can. The project will also contribute to fundamental methodological development for the use of inexpensive temperature sensors in high-latitude environments and synthetic assessment of standard species distribution modeling.","parentId":"586fbe18e4b01a71ba0bc9a6","contacts":[{"name":"Jeremy Littell","type":"Principal

(UAF) have developed an extensive suite of research related to the impacts of climate variability and change on permafrost within the Alaska region.&nbsp; In turn, this body of AK CSC sponsored research compliments a variety of previous and ongoing efforts based at the UAF and aimed at understanding linkages among temperature increase, permafrost degradation, thermokarst formation and erosional processes.&nbsp; However, given the mission of the AK CSC to inform resource management, adaptation and planning, there is a critical need to translate these scientific findings into products, resources and services that can be applied in a decision support context.&nbsp; As a result, the AK CSC is partnering with UAF to hire a new post-doctoral Fellow that will be tasked with the development and dissemination of synthesis products related to permafrost research in recent years.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nThe Fellow will also assist in a National Science Foundation funded project: Study

In many cases the effects of precipitation variability and change are less visible, especially where precipitation arrives mainly as snow.&nbsp; However, snow remains a crucial component of atmospheric and hydrologic dynamics, and key driver of regional ecosystems.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nAddressing \u201csnow drought\u201d as it manifests in changes to total snowfall amounts, snow accumulation, and the timing\/length of the snow season are then critical for understanding and predicting a host of climate impacts. Unfortunately, snowfall-dominated areas defy traditional approaches to drought characterization. As such, this project seeks to address the following research questions:\n<ol>\n\t<li>What are the most effective definitions of meteorological and hydrological snow drought for Alaska?<\/li>\n\t<li>What are the temporal features or indicators for snow drought?<\/li>\n\t<li>How crucial is the gap between how well we measure snow at gauges (meteorological snow drought) and snowpack conditions (hydrological snow drought)?<\/li>\n\t<li>What changes in snowpack and snow drought susceptibility are potentially due to changes in cover or terrain?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThis project will also use existing datasets (ground observations, reanalyses, remote sensing datasets, and modeled) to address snow drought in Alaska. Specific tasks for the project include:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Analyzing various drought indices and their coherence, as well as their temporal and spatial variability to assess their suitability for Alaska conditions.<\/li>\n\t<li>Assessing snowpack characteristics (e.g., timing of arrival and departure, speed of departure) on drought manifestation and severity, and if those characters are exacerbating snow drought occurrences or extent over time.<\/li>\n\t<li>Exploring the linkages among station observations (precipitation falling from the sky) and snowpack development (snow on the ground) with drought.<\/li>\n\t<li>Observing whether snow drought conditions are tied to ecosystem trajectories, vegetation indices, or fire occurrence, and how changing landscapes and ecosystems are impacting snow distributions.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","parentId":"586fbe18e4b01a71ba0bc9a6","contacts":[{"name":"Christopher A.

However, climate change vulnerability assessments for coastal wetlands generally focus solely on sea-level rise without considering the effects of other facets of climate change. Across the globe and in all ecosystems, macroclimatic drivers (e.g., temperature and rainfall regimes) greatly influence ecosystem structure and function. Macroclimatic drivers have been the focus of climate-change related threat evaluations for terrestrial ecosystems, but largely ignored for coastal wetlands. In some coastal wetlands, changing macroclimatic conditions are expected to result in foundation plant species replacement, which would affect the supply of certain ecosystem goods and services and could affect ecosystem resilience.

Relatively low DO (&lt;6 mg\/L) also was measured at relatively high discharge (3.2 m3\/s) and maximum T (22.2 \u00b0C).

However, natural variability of Earth\u2019s climate system can degrade capabilities for identifying climate trends. Here we produced a long-term (1982\u20132013) remote sensing based land ET record and investigated multidecadal changes in global ET and underlying causes. The ET record shows a significant upward global trend of 0.88 mm yr\u22122&nbsp;( \nP &lt; 0.001) over the 32-year period, mainly driven by vegetation greening (0.018% per year;&nbsp; \nP &lt; 0.001) and rising atmosphere moisture demand (0.75 mm yr\u22122;&nbsp; \nP = 0.016). Our results indicate that reduced ET growth between 1998 and 2008 was an episodic phenomenon, with subsequent recovery of the ET growth rate after 2008.

To address this challenge, this project seeks to establish unique, cutting-edge, dynamic downscaling capabilities among the SC CSC partners using a system that is expected to better capture physical variability and extremes as well as their uncertainties, and be able to more accurately quantify the impacts on agriculture, fish and wildlife, water availability and quality, and cultural resources, etc., all of which are key challenges facing the communities of the region. &nbsp;This information will be provided to and is expected to be used by public and private sector managers and decision makers facing climate adaptation challenges.","type":["Project"],"parent_id":"4f8c652fe4b0546c0c397b4a"},"239":{"id":"551ec03ee4b027f0aee3b95b","fy":"2015","title":"Very High-Resolution Dynamic Downscaling of Regional Climate for Use in Long-term Hydrologic Planning along the Red River Valley System","authors":["Ming Xue","Xiaoming Hu"],"csc":["South Central CSC"],"keywords":["CSC","South Central CSC","2015","water resource management","dynamic downscaling","ensemble"],"dates":{"start":"2015","end":"2017","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-04-03T10:30:54.883-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-12-14T11:35:16.068-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"status":"In Progress","author-orgs":["Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms (CAPS), University of Oklahoma","University of Oklahoma"],"body":"Across the Southern Great Plains, climate change is expected to cause more severe droughts, more intense heavy rainfall events, and subsequently more flooding episodes. These potential changes in climate will adversely affect habitats, ecosystems, and landscapes as well as the fish and wildlife they support. But while today\u2019s global climate models (GCMs) provide generally accurate, large-scale projections, local predictions are notoriously imprecise, and impede proper, long-term mitigation planning. To address these challenges, this research will take a collaborative multi-organization approach that leverages the expertise of the University of Oklahoma, Department of Interior South Central Climate Science Center, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

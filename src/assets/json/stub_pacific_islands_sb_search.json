National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP\/NCAR) reanalysis data from wet season months (November to April) 1958\u20132010 are composited for heavy rain days at 12 rainfall stations in the Hawaiian Islands. The occurrence of heavy rain events (days with amounts above the 90th percentile estimated from all wet season rain days 1958\u20132010) was found to be strongly correlated with upper level cyclonic circulation anomalies centered northwest of Hawai\u2018i and south-to-north transport of water vapor in the middle troposphere.

Panel regression is used to overcome limitations of traditional regression methods, and obtain reliable model coefficients, in particular to understand the elasticity of streamflow to rainfall. Using annual rainfall and selected basin characteristics at 86 gaged streams in the Hawaiian Islands, regional regression models for three stream classes were developed to estimate the annual low-flow duration discharges. Three panel-regression structures (random effects, fixed effects, and pooled) were compared to traditional regression methods, in which space is substituted for time.

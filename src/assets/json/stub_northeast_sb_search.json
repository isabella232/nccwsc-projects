We combined annual tree ring measurements and mortality models to address two questions: first, how do assumptions about tree growth and mortality influence reconstructions of biomass growth? Second, under what circumstances does biomass production follow the model that peaks early, then declines? We integrated three stochastic mortality models with a census tree-ring data set from eight temperate forest types to reconstruct stand-level biomass increments (in Minnesota, USA).

In this study, three stream temperature models were implemented for two different case-study basins in the Northeast Climate Science Center region. Two coupled hydrology-stream temperature (physical) models were used: VIC-RBM and SWAT-Ficklin et al. (2012). The third model implemented was a nonlinear regression (statistical) model developed by Mohseni et al. (1998). Metrics were developed to assess these models regarding their prediction skill, data input requirements, spatial and temporal resolutions, and \u201cuser-friendliness.\u201d This comprehensive assessment will be employed by aquatic resource managers in need of projected stream temperatures for management decisions in the face of climate change. Additionally, these models were used to predict stream temperatu...","type":["Publication"]},"230":{"id":"580151dae4b0824b2d18be18","csc":"Northeast CSC","title":"StreamThermal: A Software Package for Calculating Thermal Metrics from Stream Temperature Data","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/03632415.2016.1210517):&nbsp;Improving quality and better availability of continuous stream temperature data allow natural resource managers, particularly in fisheries, to understand associations between different characteristics of stream thermal regimes and stream fishes. However, there is no convenient tool to efficiently characterize multiple metrics reflecting stream thermal regimes with the increasing amount of data from continuously recording data loggers. This article describes a software program packaged as a library in R to facilitate this process. With this freely available package, users will be able to quickly summarize metrics that describe five categories of stream thermal regimes: magnitude, variability, frequency, timing, and rate of change. The installation and usage instruction of this package, the definition of calculated thermal metrics, as well as the output format from the package are described, along with an application sh...","type":["Publication"]},"231":{"id":"5519b35de4b03238427832e4","csc":"Northeast CSC","title":"Supporting Cooperation Between Tribes and Climate Scientists in the Northeast Region","body":"All peoples have a right to make meaningful plans for their future.

As custodians of ecological goods and services valued by society, coastal National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) have an especially important role to play in helping socio-ecological systems adapt to global-change processes.&nbsp;To help refuges address this challenge, we articulated a two-track decision problem faced by coastal refuge managers.

Federal land management agencies (e.g., US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, USDA Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management and Department of Defense) are required to adopt policies that respond to climate change and may have longer-term institutional support to enforce such policies compared to state, local, non-governmental, or private land managers.

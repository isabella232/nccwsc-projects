The broad range of complex factors influencing coastal systems contributes to large uncertainties in predicting long-term sea level rise impacts. Here we explore and demonstrate the capabilities of a Bayesian network (BN) to predict long-term shoreline change associated with sea level rise and make quantitative assessments of prediction uncertainty. A BN is used to define relationships between driving forces, geologic constraints, and coastal response for the U.S. Atlantic coast that include observations of local rates of relative sea level rise, wave height, tide range, geomorphic classification, coastal slope, and shoreline change rate. The BN is used to make probabilistic predictions of shoreline retreat in response to different future sea level rise rates.

Cankerworms are common pests of urban trees that have been shown in forests to disperse from preferred to less preferred hosts. I found that two common characteristics of urban habitats, low vegetational diversity and exotic plants, affect cankerworm herbivory of non-host understory plants. In an urban landscape I measured cankerworm herbivory on native dogwood trees growing in the open and below cankerworm host and non-host trees.&nbsp;Herbivory&nbsp;of native dogwoods was ten times greater below cankerworm hosts than on trees below non-hosts or in the open.

However, climate change vulnerability assessments for coastal wetlands generally focus solely on sea-level rise without considering the effects of other facets of climate change. Across the globe and in all ecosystems, macroclimatic drivers (e.g., temperature and rainfall regimes) greatly influence ecosystem structure and function. Macroclimatic drivers have been the focus of climate-change related threat evaluations for terrestrial ecosystems, but largely ignored for coastal wetlands. In some coastal wetlands, changing macroclimatic conditions are expected to result in foundation plant species replacement, which would affect the supply of certain ecosystem goods and services and could affect ecosystem resilience.

Because of this, the most common recommended strategy to protect wildlife as climate changes is to connect their habitats, providing them safe passage. There are great challenges to implementing this strategy in the southeastern US, however, because most intervening lands between habitat patches are held in private ownership. In partnership with South Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative members, we assessed current and projected connectivity for three species&nbsp;that inhabit bottomland hardwoods throughout the southeastern US:&nbsp;black bear (Ursus americanus), Rafinesque\u2019s big-eared bat (Corynorhinus rafinesquii), and timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus).&nbsp;For each species, we measured connectivity using three different modeling approaches that incorporate...","type":["Project","Data"],"parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c"},"144":{"id":"535fd531e4b078dca33ae521","fy":"Unknown","title":"Connectivity Modeling web page","authors":null,"csc":["Southeast CSC"],"keywords":["landscape resistance","modeling connectivity","wildlife","habitats","climate","land use "],"dates":{"pub":"2013","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-04-29T10:37:05.966-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-23T09:42:12.613-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"status":"Unknown","author-orgs":["No organizations associated with this item."],"body":"This project is a collaboration with scientists from North Carolina State University, the University of Florida, the Wildlands Network, USGS, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Southeast Climate Science Center, and southeastern Landscape Conservation Cooperatives.&nbsp; We are using multiple approaches to defining landscape resistance and modeling connectivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;","type":"Unknown","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c"},"145":{"id":"55fb1b38e4b05d6c4e501c08","fy":"2015","title":"Consequences of Urbanization and Climate Change on Human and Ecosystem Health","authors":["Steven D.

In this experiment we manipulated temperature in field-based, open-top chambers for three years to examine the relationship between biotic interactions and climatic warming on the population dynamics of seedlings of Quercus alba. We investigated the effect of warming on rates of insect herbivory on Q. alba seedlings.

Cultural resources represent evidence of past human activity, such as archeological sites, or are of significance to a group of people traditionally associated with the resource, such as Native American ceremonial sites.\n  &nbsp;\n  Climate change is challenging the long-term persistence of many cultural resources. For example, those located in coastal areas, such as historic lighthouses, are threatened by sea-level rise, shoreline erosion, and more frequent severe storm events. While climate change challenges managers of both natural and cultural resources to make decisions in the face of uncertainty, far less work has been done to identify the impacts of climate change on cultural resources, compared to natural resources.&nbsp;\n  &nbsp;\n  To address this critical gap, researchers are developing a strategy to aid decision makers in climate adaptation planning efforts.

Here, we ask whether these documented latitudinal patterns can be generalized to predict arthropod responses to warming across mid- and high temperate latitudes, for taxa whose thermal physiology has not been measured. To address this question, we used a novel natural experiment consisting of a series of urban warming gradients at different latitudes. Specifically, we sampled arthropods from a single common street tree species across temperature gradients in four US cities, located from 35.8 to 42.4\u00b0 latitude.

Urban sprawl strongly impacts the urban ecosystems it creates and the natural and agro-ecosystems that it displaces and fragments. Here, we project urban sprawl changes for the next 50 years for the fast-growing Southeast U.S. Previous studies have focused on modeling population density, but the urban extent is arguably as important as population density per se in terms of its ecological and conservation impacts. We develop simulations using the SLEUTH urban growth model that complement population-driven models but focus on spatial pattern and extent. To better capture the reach of low-density suburban development, we extend the capabilities of SLEUTH by incorporating street-network information.

Using a unique, citywide, factorial experiment, we investigated how warming and insect herbivory affected physiological function and carbon sequestration (carbon stored per year) of mature trees. Urban warming increased herbivorous arthropod abundance on trees, but these herbivores had negligible effects on tree carbon sequestration. Instead, urban warming was associated with an estimated 12% loss of carbon sequestration, in part because photosynthesis was reduced at hotter sites. Ecosystem service assessments that do not consider urban conditions may overestimate urban tree carbon storage. Because urban and global warming are becoming more intense, our results suggest that urban trees will sequester even less carbon in the future.","type":["Publication"],"parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c"},"354":{"id":"57f7d11ce4b0bc0bec09cfee","fy":"Unknown","title":"Urban Warming Slows Tree Growth, Photosynthesis","authors":["Emily Meineke"],"csc":["Southeast CSC"],"keywords":["Urban Warming","Trees","Photosynthesis","Pests","Insects"],"dates":{"other":[{"type":"Release","dateString":"2016-10-05","label":"Release Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-10-07T10:45:16.163-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-07T10:45:53.675-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"status":"Unknown","author-orgs":["North Carolina State University"],"body":"New research from North Carolina State University finds that urban warming reduces growth and photosynthesis in city trees.

In an eastern deciduous forest system in the United States with approximately 40 ant species, we found that for some species, the loss of thermal niche space for foraging was related to decreases in abundance with increasing experimental climatic warming.

To determine the importance of vegetation in these processes, we measured elevation change and surface accretion over a 4-year period in recently subsided, unvegetated marshes, resulting from drought-induced marsh dieback, in paired planted and unplanted plots.

Through computer simulations that are run under a range of future management and climate scenarios, this project builds upon a body of knowledge that can help inform management planning for a changing future, raising the likelihood that ecosystems can be sustained for both humans and wildlife.","parentId":"55317b6ee4b0b22a1580631a","contacts":[{"name":"Institute for Natural Resources","type":"Point of Contact","email":"emilie.henderson@oregonstate.edu","primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"541-737-9918","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"97207","country":"USA","city":"Corvallis","state":"OR","line2":"Oregon State University","line1":"PO Box 751"}}},{"name":"Emilie Henderson","type":"Metadata Contact","email":"emilie.henderson@oregonstate.edu","organization":{"displayText":"Institute for Natural Resources, Oregon State University"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"541-737-9918","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"97207","country":"USA","city":"Corvallis","state":"OR","line2":"Oregon State University","line1":"PO Box 751"}}},{"name":"Emilie Henderson","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Megan Creutzberg","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jessica Halofsky","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Institute for Natural Resources, Oregon State University","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Data"],"tags":[{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"Stream temperature"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"climate change"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"land management"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"state and transition modeling"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"vegetation change"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"vulnerability assessment"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"wildlife habitat"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Pacific Northwest"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Washington"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Pacific Coast"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015-04-22","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"Start","dateString":"2007","label":""},{"type":"End","dateString":"2096","label":""},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-04-17T15:32:09.319-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-02-26T09:23:49.560-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":115512,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-04-17T21:31:57.000Z","name":"2LookupTablesAndDefinitions.zip","pathOnDisk":"__disk__4d\/94\/22\/4d9422dede27d67184c3e784a81dde74a8af7093","title":"","contentType":"application\/zip","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55317bd9e4b0b22a15806320?f=__disk__4d%2F94%2F22%2F4d9422dede27d67184c3e784a81dde74a8af7093"},{"originalMetadata":true,"processed":false,"size":9239,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-04-22T23:30:58.000Z","name":"northwestWashington_lookUpTables_metadata.xml","pathOnDisk":"__disk__e3\/8c\/45\/e38c453332ed27f54f78123a8635421def941aac","title":"","contentType":"application\/fgdc+xml","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55317bd9e4b0b22a15806320?f=__disk__e3%2F8c%2F45%2Fe38c453332ed27f54f78123a8635421def941aac"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55317bd9e4b0b22a15806320","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"2LookupTablesan.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46"},"55352d51e4b0b22a158078de":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5006e784e4b0abf7ce733f4d","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"2 Lookup Tables and Definitions","relatedTitle":"Climate, Land Management and Future Wildlife Habitat in the Pacific Northwest","id":"55352d51e4b0b22a158078de","relatedId":"5006e784e4b0abf7ce733f4d","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/55352d51e4b0b22a158078de","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Climate, Land Management and Future Wildlife Habitat in the Pacific Northwest","relatedTitle":"2 Lookup Tables and Definitions","id":"5006e784e4b0abf7ce733f4d","relatedId":"55352d51e4b0b22a158078de","annotation":null}]},"id":"55352d51e4b0b22a158078de","title":"2 Lookup Tables and Definitions","body":"The following files are designed to be run using the Path Landscape Model software, version 3.0.4.

The csv files within HabitatSummary are designed to be joined ot the grid mentioned above, to allow for a spatial depiction of habitat projections. There is one column per modeled year, containing a summary that indicates the proportion of each modeling stratum that is comprised of potential greater sage grouse habitat (the general summary, not the high-quality summary, averaged over monte carlo repetitions). Sample queries outlining how to build new summaries of output data for mapping from the ClassesSummary files and lookup tables are included in the database: SEO_Summaries.accdb Due to a minor error in starting conditions, summaries of sage-grouse habitat may be underestimated in the early years, especially within the northwestern quadrant of the map. Because of this, we have removed the summaries of the first four years within the Habitat summary files, and constrain the sample queries to only show projections for after 2011. If the early years of this summary data are needed for viewing other parts of the map, they can be constructed by removing a constraint within query1 of the sample queries shown above.","purpose":"Balancing socio-economic and ecological demands on forests is an ongoing challenge and may be further complicated by future changes in climate.

The available meteorological data include temperature, precipitation, and wind, as well as derived humidity and downwelling solar and infrared radiation estimated via algorithms that index these quantities to the daily mean temperature, temperature range, and precipitation, and disaggregate them to 3-hourly time steps. Furthermore, the authors employ the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model to produce 3-hourly estimates of soil moisture, snow water equivalent, discharge, and surface heat fluxes. Relative to an earlier similar dataset by Maurer and others, the improved dataset has 1) extended the period of analysis (1915\u20132011 versus 1950\u20132000), 2) increased the spatial resolution from \u215b&deg; to&nbsp;\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/journals.ametsoc.org\/na101\/home\/literatum\/publisher\/ams\/journals\/content\/clim\/2013\/15200442-26.23\/jcli-d-12-00508.1\/20131226\/images\/medium\/jcli-d-12-00508.1-inf1.gif\" \/>, and 3) used an updated version of VIC. The previous dataset has been widely used in water and energy budget studies, climate change assessments, drought reconstructions, and for many other purposes. It is anticipated that the spatial refinement and temporal extension will be of interest to a wide cross section of the scientific community.","parentId":"502aaaaae4b0a8e4a0fdb197","contacts":[{"name":"Ben Livneh","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science (CIRES), University of Colorado, Boulder"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Eric A.

Beginning in the late 1800s and expanding after World War II, fish and wildlife managers intentionally introduced millions of predatory trout (primarily&nbsp; \n<em>Oncorhynchus<\/em> &nbsp;spp) into fishless mountain ponds and lakes across the western states. These new top predators, which now occupy 95% of large mountain lakes, have limited the habitat distributions of native frogs, salamanders, and wetland invertebrates to smaller, more ephemeral ponds where trout do not survive. Now a second \u201cexperiment\u201d \u2013 anthropogenic climate change \u2013 threatens to eliminate many of these ephemeral habitats and shorten wetland hydroperiods. Caught between climate-induced habitat loss and predation from introduced fish, native mountain lake fauna of the western US \u2013 especially amphibians \u2013 are at risk of extirpation. Targeted fish removals, guided by models of how wetlands will change under future climate scenarios, provide innovative strategies for restoring resilience of wetland ecosystems to climate change.

Genetic data can be used with landscape models and traditional ecological assessment data to identify biodiversity hotspots, predict ecosystem responses to anthropogenic effects, and detect impairments to underlying processes. We show that by combining taxonomic, demographic, and genetic data of species in complex riverscapes, managers can better understand the spatial and temporal scales over which environmental processes and disturbance influence biodiversity. We describe how population genetic models using empirical or simulated genetic data quantify effects of environmental processes affecting species diversity and distribution. Our summary shows that aquatic assessment initiatives that use standardized data sets to direct management actions can benefit from integration of genetic data to improve the predictability of disturbance\u2013response relationships of river fishes and their habitats over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales.<\/div>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50465251e4b0241d49d62c7c"],"contacts":[{"name":"Kim T Scribner","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Winsor H.

The intimate connections that tribes have maintained with the natural environment are more spiritually rich and complex than non-Native consumptive views of natural resources. After careful consideration of tribe size, level of cultural activity, strength of ties to the environment, and connection to culturally significant and aboriginal geographic regions, three Northwest tribes were selected for this study--the&nbsp;Confederated Tribes of Salish and Kootenai, the Qinault Indian Nation, and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians. Information was collected through interviews with tribal elders and individuals with substantial cultural expertise. We found that in addition to changes in specific cultural practices, a profound disruption to identity connected with (a) changes in seasonality, disturbing the sense of natural time; and (b) a sense that wisdom passed down through generations is no longer a sound basis for which decisions are made. These observations contribute to the understanding of Northwest tribal culture and its vulnerability and adaptive capacity to a changing climate. This research documented traditional cultural commonalities among the tribes involved with this project and illustrated inter-tribal cultural adaptations to their prevailing environmental conditions.

Models predict warmer temperatures and more precipitation as rainfall and decreased snowfall occur over the next 50 years, which will directly affect the abundance of culturally significant foods, such as salmon, deer, root plants, and berries. These foods are important for ceremonies and subsistence, and in some instances commercial activities. Tribes\u2019 access to traditional hunting, fishing, and gathering sites is guaranteed by treaty, executive order, and agreements with the United States government. \n\nThe Tribal Leadership Forum (TLF) was awarded a grant by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to conduct a survey of 15 Columbia River Basin Tribes and 3 Intertribal Organizations to assess their policy and technical capacity and needs to address climate change. In summary, the 15 Tribes and 3 Intertribal organizations have disparate levels of technical, management, and policy capacity related to climate change planning and ability to implement adaptation plans. All of the Tribes and 3 Intertribal organizations have limited resources to adequately plan and adapt to climate change impacts affecting their communities and natural resources in the Columbia River Basin. The Columbia River Basin Tribes and 3 Intertribal organizations identified a variety of needs including increasing their technical, policy and management capacities, increasing tribal community awareness of climate change impacts, and increased funding and staffing to develop vulnerability assessments, adaptation plans, and effectively engage in regional climate planning forums.","parentId":"531899cce4b051b1b924ea01","contacts":[{"name":"Donald Sampson","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"don@seventhgenerationllc.com","organization":{"displayText":"Tribal Leadership Forum"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Label","name":"Tribal"},{"type":"Label","name":"Columbia River Basin"},{"type":"Label","name":"Tribal Capacity Assessment"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Location","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Location","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Northwest CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-09-22","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2015-05-30","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-09-25T11:18:17.637-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-27T17:46:20.153-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"Completed","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Grant Award Number","value":"G14AP00191"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":63499.37,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2014","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":63499.37}]},{"facetName":"Expando","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ExpandoFacet"}],"files":[{"imageWidth":3264,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":4382223,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2016-03-17T18:41:01.000Z","name":"NW-2014-3_ColumbiaRiver_WA_AlexDemas_USGS.JPG","pathOnDisk":"__disk__81\/4a\/06\/814a0622425cc63f569a2861b3d4d7fc841ccd51","title":"Columbia River, WA -

Loss of winter snow pack, reduced summer stream flows, and increased summer temperatures are all phenomena that have already been observed, and are expected to worsen over this century. Research is ongoing in the Northwest to understand agriculture practices that might allow farmers to prepare for these climate change impacts.

To address this lack of information, this project will evaluate the potential for biochar soil amendments to mitigate drought impacts on agriculture. Results of these studies will be used to develop a web-based Pacific Northwest Biochar Atlas, providing interactive maps that show potential biochar feedstocks, biochar producers and early adopters, results of biochar studies, and calculators that can be used to estimate biochar impacts on moisture retention, as well as maps of projected changes in precipitation and temperature. <\/div>","purpose":"Climate change is predicted to diminish mountain snow packs.

Washington","body":"The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon. We performed bathymetric surveys using a shallow-water echo-sounding system comprised of an acoustic profiler, Leica Viva RTK GPS, and laptop computer mounted on a shallow-draft, portable flat-bottom boat. The RTK GPS enabled high resolution elevations of the water surface. The rover positions were received from the Leica Smartnet system or base station and referenced to the same bench mark used in the elevation surveys. We mounted a variable frequency transducer on the front of the boat and connected it to the sounder; the sounder worked in areas of &gt;10 cm of water. We recorded twenty depth readings and one GPS location each second along transects spaced 100 m apart perpendicular to the nearby salt marsh. We calibrated the system before use with a bar-check plate and adjusted the sound velocity for salinity and temperature differences. The bar-check plate was suspended below the transducer at a known depth that was verified against the transducer readings. We synthesized the bathymetry data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) of the nearshore regions at Port Susan, Skokomish, Nisqually, Grays Harbor, Willapa, and Bull Island using ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size). We removed portions of bathymetry data that overlapped with elevation surveys conducted on the tidal marsh. We present elevation data as local orthometric heights (NAVD88). At Padilla we mapped the nearshore area using the methodologies outlined in the project report as the dense eelgrass beds would have increased the error in acoustic measurements","purpose":"At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions. Overall tidal range decreased from northern Washington to southern Oregon.","parentId":"554cd7d2e4b082ec54129d68","contacts":[{"name":"Karen M Thorne","oldPartyId":13502,"type":"Point of

Washington","body":"The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon. We performed bathymetric surveys using a shallow-water echo-sounding system comprised of an acoustic profiler, Leica Viva RTK GPS, and laptop computer mounted on a shallow-draft, portable flat-bottom boat. The RTK GPS enabled high resolution elevations of the water surface. The rover positions were received from the Leica Smartnet system or base station and referenced to the same bench mark used in the elevation surveys. We mounted a variable frequency transducer on the front of the boat and connected it to the sounder; the sounder worked in areas of &gt;10 cm of water. We recorded twenty depth readings and one GPS location each second along transects spaced 100 m apart perpendicular to the nearby salt marsh. We calibrated the system before use with a bar-check plate and adjusted the sound velocity for salinity and temperature differences. The bar-check plate was suspended below the transducer at a known depth that was verified against the transducer readings. We synthesized the bathymetry data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) of the nearshore regions at Port Susan, Skokomish, Nisqually, Grays Harbor, Willapa, and Bull Island using ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size). We removed portions of bathymetry data that overlapped with elevation surveys conducted on the tidal marsh. We present elevation data as local orthometric heights (NAVD88). At Padilla we mapped the nearshore area using the methodologies outlined in the project report as the dense eelgrass beds would have increased the error in acoustic measurements","purpose":"At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions. Overall tidal range decreased from northern Washington to southern Oregon.","parentId":"554cd7d2e4b082ec54129d68","contacts":[{"name":"Karen M Thorne","oldPartyId":13502,"type":"Point of

Washington","body":"The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon. We performed bathymetric surveys using a shallow-water echo-sounding system comprised of an acoustic profiler, Leica Viva RTK GPS, and laptop computer mounted on a shallow-draft, portable flat-bottom boat. The RTK GPS enabled high resolution elevations of the water surface. The rover positions were received from the Leica Smartnet system or base station and referenced to the same bench mark used in the elevation surveys. We mounted a variable frequency transducer on the front of the boat and connected it to the sounder; the sounder worked in areas of &gt;10 cm of water. We recorded twenty depth readings and one GPS location each second along transects spaced 100 m apart perpendicular to the nearby salt marsh. We calibrated the system before use with a bar-check plate and adjusted the sound velocity for salinity and temperature differences. The bar-check plate was suspended below the transducer at a known depth that was verified against the transducer readings. We synthesized the bathymetry data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) of the nearshore regions at Port Susan, Skokomish, Nisqually, Grays Harbor, Willapa, and Bull Island using ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size). We removed portions of bathymetry data that overlapped with elevation surveys conducted on the tidal marsh. We present elevation data as local orthometric heights (NAVD88). At Padilla we mapped the nearshore area using the methodologies outlined in the project report as the dense eelgrass beds would have increased the error in acoustic measurements","purpose":"At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services.

Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast.

Washington","body":"The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon. We performed bathymetric surveys using a shallow-water echo-sounding system comprised of an acoustic profiler, Leica Viva RTK GPS, and laptop computer mounted on a shallow-draft, portable flat-bottom boat. The RTK GPS enabled high resolution elevations of the water surface. The rover positions were received from the Leica Smartnet system or base station and referenced to the same bench mark used in the elevation surveys. We mounted a variable frequency transducer on the front of the boat and connected it to the sounder; the sounder worked in areas of &gt;10 cm of water. We recorded twenty depth readings and one GPS location each second along transects spaced 100 m apart perpendicular to the nearby salt marsh. We calibrated the system before use with a bar-check plate and adjusted the sound velocity for salinity and temperature differences. The bar-check plate was suspended below the transducer at a known depth that was verified against the transducer readings. We synthesized the bathymetry data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) of the nearshore regions at Port Susan, Skokomish, Nisqually, Grays Harbor, Willapa, and Bull Island using ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size). We removed portions of bathymetry data that overlapped with elevation surveys conducted on the tidal marsh. We present elevation data as local orthometric heights (NAVD88). At Padilla we mapped the nearshore area using the methodologies outlined in the project report as the dense eelgrass beds would have increased the error in acoustic measurements","purpose":"At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions. Overall tidal range decreased from northern Washington to southern Oregon.","parentId":"554cd7d2e4b082ec54129d68","contacts":[{"name":"Karen M Thorne","oldPartyId":13502,"type":"Point of

Washington","body":"The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon. We performed bathymetric surveys using a shallow-water echo-sounding system comprised of an acoustic profiler, Leica Viva RTK GPS, and laptop computer mounted on a shallow-draft, portable flat-bottom boat. The RTK GPS enabled high resolution elevations of the water surface. The rover positions were received from the Leica Smartnet system or base station and referenced to the same bench mark used in the elevation surveys. We mounted a variable frequency transducer on the front of the boat and connected it to the sounder; the sounder worked in areas of &gt;10 cm of water. We recorded twenty depth readings and one GPS location each second along transects spaced 100 m apart perpendicular to the nearby salt marsh. We calibrated the system before use with a bar-check plate and adjusted the sound velocity for salinity and temperature differences. The bar-check plate was suspended below the transducer at a known depth that was verified against the transducer readings. We synthesized the bathymetry data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) of the nearshore regions at Port Susan, Skokomish, Nisqually, Grays Harbor, Willapa, and Bull Island using ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size). We removed portions of bathymetry data that overlapped with elevation surveys conducted on the tidal marsh. We present elevation data as local orthometric heights (NAVD88). At Padilla we mapped the nearshore area using the methodologies outlined in the project report as the dense eelgrass beds would have increased the error in acoustic measurements","purpose":"At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions. Overall tidal range decreased from northern Washington to southern Oregon.","parentId":"554cd7d2e4b082ec54129d68","contacts":[{"name":"Karen M Thorne","oldPartyId":13502,"type":"Point of

This project will help address limited tribal capacity for vulnerability assessment by providing guidance and data tailored to the needs and capacities of Northwest and Great Basin tribes. Specifically, the project will: \u2022 Make the vulnerability assessment process more accessible to tribal staff by providing online guidance materials targeted to tribal needs and capacities; \u2022 Address the demand for climate data at the scale of tribal decision-making by providing downscaled climate data and climate change summaries for tribes; and \u2022 Support tribal staff through the vulnerability assessment process via workshops and a webinar to provide training on the use of project resources and datasets, and by staffing a Tribal Climate Technical Support Desk to provide rapid response to relevant queries. These objectives will be accomplished in consultation with an advisory group consisting of representatives from regional tribes and tribal organizations. We will also work with existing tribal knowledge-sharing networks to connect project products and training opportunities to a broad range of tribal communities.

Arthington, 2012; Liermann and others, 2012). In the Pacific Northwest, dams on major rivers have been a major focus for fishery managers, primarily in regard to passage of anadromous salmonids (principally Pacific salmon and steelhead trout [<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss<\/em>], for example, Ferguson and others, 2011), but more recently other species, such as Pacific lamprey (<em>Entosphenus tridentatus<\/em>) and resident (non-anadromous) salmonids, are receiving more attention (Neraas and Spruell, 2001; Moser and others, 2002; Muhlfeld and others, 2012). In the case of resident salmonids, fish can adopt a wide range of migratory behaviors that often bring them into mainstem rivers where they can come into direct contact with large dams. When this occurs, some of the most important direct effects of dams on salmonids include barriers to upstream and downstream movement and mortality associated with entrainment within the dam or spill over dams. Biologically, these direct impacts can lead to (1) disruption of natural historical (pre-dam) genetic and demographic connectivity among local populations, (2) loss of access to historically used migratory destinations, (3) loss of individuals to the population through mortality associated with entrainment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In this report, we address these issues for the case of Boundary Dam, located immediately south of the Canadian border on the lower Pend Oreille River in northeastern Washington (fig. 1).

Bull Trout Vulnerability Assessment: &nbsp;This analysis was generated to show the relative vulnerability of bull trout across&nbsp;the Columbia basin. Input variables include the prportion of valley bottom (e.g. floodplains), the average max summer temperature (July 15th to Sept 15th), and winter flood&nbsp;frequency (the frequency of high flow events exceeding the 95th percentile from December&nbsp;through March) for a given watershed. The estimates for temperature and flow were taken from&nbsp;the mouth of the watershed. This analysis includes historic and future (2040s scenario).&nbsp;Stream temperature and flow data are avaliable at rap.ntsg.umt.edu. See Wu H, Kimball JS, Elsner MM,&nbsp;Mantua N, Adler RF, Stanford JA (2012a) Projected climate change impacts on the hydrology&nbsp;and temperature of Pacific Northwest rivers. Water Resources Research, 48, W11530 for&nbsp;information on stream temp and flow data.\n<br> \n<br> 2. Valley Bottoms: &nbsp;Valley bottoms for the Columbia River were generated from an algorithm for Dave&nbsp;Nagel (USFS). See Nagel, D. E., J. M. Buffington, S. Parkes, S. J. Wenger, and J. R. Goode&nbsp;(2013) A landscape Scale Valley Confinement Algorithm: delineating unconfined valley bottoms&nbsp;for geomorphic, aquatic, and riparian applications. Page 42. RMRS-GTR-321. USDA Forest&nbsp;Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Boise, ID for more information. Input used to&nbsp;delineate the valley bottoms include a 30 m DEM and the NHD moderate resolution&nbsp;data.The algorithm estimates unconfined valley bottoms (UVB) from elevation and stream data&nbsp;in a GIS. We used the NHD streams and 30 m National Elevation Dataset (NED) data packaged&nbsp;with the NHD dataset. The UVB algorithm calculates a first-pass estimate of UVB using a GIS&nbsp;cost-distance approach (distance from stream times ground slope), and results are refined using a valley-filling procedure where a valley is \u201cflooded\u201d to a set flood height&nbsp;above the stream channel elevation. The flood height is set as a user-defined \u201cflood factor\u201d&nbsp;multiplied by bankfull depth. We used a flood factor of 6 in this analysis. The flood height&nbsp;is spread outward from the stream until it intersects a valley wall, and is further confined&nbsp;by a user-defined maximum ground slope (9%) and max valley width, which we set to 2000 m.&nbsp; We used an annual mean precipitation value of 150 cm for the study area, and all other&nbsp;variables in the algorithm were set to defaults. Further details on the algorithm can be&nbsp;found in Nagel et al. (2014). We used the percent slope calculated as part of the UVB&nbsp;algorithm (using the 30 m NED data).","purpose":"This analysis was generated to show the relative vulnerability of bull trout across the Columbia basin.","parentId":"5046524ae4b0241d49d62c7a","contacts":[{"name":"Diane Whited","type":"Point of Contact","contactType":"person","email":"diane.whited@flbs.umt.edu","firstName":"Diane","lastName":"Whited","organization":{"displayText":"University of Montana"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Data"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"tags":[{"type":"Subject","name":"bull trout"},{"type":"Subject","name":"vulnerability"},{"type":"Subject","name":"valley bottoms"},{"type":"Place","name":"Columbia River Basin"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015-02-13","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-02-13T16:50:18.245-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-03-16T08:25:09.108-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":9789307,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-02-13T23:36:43.000Z","name":"BT vulnerability.zip","pathOnDisk":"__disk__d9\/a4\/91\/d9a49189e810f8901220ea4d94e8c53777bb2721","title":"","contentType":"application\/zip","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/54de8dbae4b08de9379b3a03?f=__disk__d9%2Fa4%2F91%2Fd9a49189e810f8901220ea4d94e8c53777bb2721"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/54de8dbae4b08de9379b3a03?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/54de8dbae4b08de9379b3a03?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/54de8dbae4b08de9379b3a03","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"BullTroutVulner.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Diane Whited"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"55e07c5fe4b0f42e3d040f3e":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"55e07c5fe4b0f42e3d040f3e","title":"Can We Conserve Wetlands Under a Changing Climate? Mapping Wetland Hydrology Across an Ecoregion and Developing Climate Adaptation Recommendations","body":"As the impacts of climate change amplify, understanding the consequences for wetland dynamics will be critical for their sustainable management and conservation, particularly in arid regions such as the Columbia Plateau ecoregion. However, the data to model climate impacts to wetland ecosystems has been hampered by the lack of accurate maps showing their spatial distribution and data on their historical hydrological dynamics. Though these data may exist for particular wetlands, there are no wall-to-wall consistent datasets of wetland location and long-term hydrological dynamics. Climate change has emphasized the growing need to plan conservation actions across large landscapes and at longer-term time scales. As such, consistent datasets become critical to assess regional trends in wetland dynamics over time, including changes in wetland function. These assessments are necessary to understanding the full picture of wetland dynamics, and to develop \u2013 and achieve \u2013 conservation goals beyond \u201cno net loss\u201d. The intent of this project is to fill critical information gaps in support of wetland conservation efforts in the Columbia Plateau ecoregion under a changing climate. First, we will provide consistent, wall-to-wall data on wetland location, historical hydrologic dynamics, and projected climate change impacts on hydrologic dynamics.

We engaged citizen scientists to collect observations of the timing of distributed snow disappearance over three snow seasons across the Pacific Northwest, U.S.A. . The primary goal of the project was to build a more spatially robust dataset documenting the influence of forest cover on the timing of snow disappearance, and public outreach was a secondary goal. Each year's effort utilized a different strategy, building on the lessons of the previous year. We began by soliciting our professional networks to contribute observations via electronic or paper forms, moved to a public outreach effort to collect geotagged photographs, and finally settled on close collaboration with an outdoor science school that was well-positioned to collect the needed data. Whereas the outreach efforts garnered abundant enthusiasm and publicity, the resulting datasets were sparse. In contrast, direct collaboration with an outdoor science school that was already sending students to make weekly snow observations proved fruitful in both data collection and educational outreach. From a data collection standpoint, the shift to an educational collaboration was successful because it essentially traded wide spatial coverage combined with sparse temporal coverage for dense temporal coverage at a single, but important location. From a public engagement standpoint, the partnership allowed for more intensive participation by more people and enhanced the science curriculum at the collaborating school.","parentId":"541b07b8e4b01571b3d654fa","contacts":[{"name":"Susan Dickerson-Lange","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Karla Bradley Eitel","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Idaho"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Leslie Dorsey","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Idaho"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Timothy E.

The ERC is a number related to the available energy (BTU) per unit area (square foot) within the flaming front at the head of a fire. The ERC is considered a composite fuel moisture index as it reflects the contribution of all live and dead fuels to potential fire intensity. As live fuels cure and dead fuels dry, the ERC will increase and can be described as a build-up index. The ERC has memory. Each daily calculation considers the past 7 days in calculating the new number. Daily variations of the ERC are relatively small as wind is not part of the calculation.&nbsp;The ERC is projected to the 2050s using three different Global Circulation Models: CanESM2, CNRM-CM5, and MIROC5. &nbsp;Other data in this project used the CCSM4 model. Since that model was not available in the ERC data, the MIROC5 model projection was used as a middle climate change projection in its stead.","purpose":"The ERC relates well to the condition of the fuels. Fire managers and planners have found that the ERC can be used as a decision tool to prepare for an approaching fire season or it can be used as a tool for daily staffing when used in combination with other NFDRS components such as 100-hr fuel moisture or the Burning Index (BI). Tracking the ERC and other NFDRS components through the season and on a daily basis will increase the situational awareness of wildland firefighters.","parentId":"5318c6bfe4b0ae6e9d5a3bb3","contacts":[{"name":"Meade Krosby","type":"Metadata Contact","contactType":"person","email":"mkrosby@uw.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington Climate Impacts Group"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"+1 206 221-2997","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"98195-5674","country":"USA","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","line1":"3737 Brooklyn Ave NE"}}},{"name":"John T.

As the western population is projected to grow by 310 million people by 2100, this will potentially increase demand for diminishing supplies if housing growth occurs in rangelands or forested lands. Understanding watershed vulnerabilities due to changing climate, fire regime, and population pressures is important to managers, and more importantly, to human well-being. Because changes from climate and population pressures cannot be altered, knowing which watersheds are currently, and will be in the future, ranked as highly vulnerable will enable proactive management of water and fuels to most effectively reduce the potential impact by wildfire. &nbsp;<\/div>\n","parentId":"531899cce4b051b1b924ea01","contacts":[{"name":"Jason R Kreitler","oldPartyId":13836,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jkreitler@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Geographer","personalTitle":"Mr.","firstName":"Jason","middleName":"R","lastName":"Kreitler","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Western Geographic Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"2084265217","streetAddress":{"zip":"83706","city":"Boise","state":"ID","line1":"970 Lusk Street"},"buildingCode":"WID","name":"Jason R Kreitler\/GEOG\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"83706","country":"USA","city":"Boise","state":"ID","line1":"970 Lusk Street"},"building":"Snake River Field Station"}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Joel B Sankey","oldPartyId":24174,"type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jsankey@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Geologist","firstName":"Joel","middleName":"B","lastName":"Sankey","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Southwest Geographic Science Team"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9285567100","officePhone":"9285567289","streetAddress":{"zip":"86001","city":"Flagstaff","state":"AZ","line1":"2255 North Gemini Drive"},"buildingCode":"WZD","name":"Joel B Sankey\/GEOG\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"86001","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"150","city":"Flagstaff","state":"AZ","line1":"2255 North Gemini Drive, Mail Stop 150"},"building":"Bldgs.4And5"}},{"name":"Todd J Hawbaker","oldPartyId":12013,"type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"tjhawbaker@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Todd","middleName":"J","lastName":"Hawbaker","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Geosciences and Environmental Change Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"3032365349","officePhone":"3032361371","streetAddress":{"zip":"80225","city":"Lakewood","state":"CO","line1":"W 6th Ave Kipling St"},"buildingCode":"KAE","name":"Todd J Hawbaker\/GEOG\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80225-0046","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"516","city":"Denver","state":"CO","line1":"Box 25046, Denver Federal Center, Mail Stop 516"},"building":"DFC Bldg 25"}},{"name":"Nicole Vaillant","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Forest Service"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Scott Lowe","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Boise State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Label","name":"water"},{"type":"Label","name":"wildland fire"},{"type":"Label","name":"ecosystem services"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Location","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Location","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Northwest CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-05-13","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2016-05-12","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-03-10T07:59:41.612-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-29T12:04:42.805-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Technical Summary","value":"Objectives\/Justification: Our objective is to understand how changing western fire frequency, extent, and location will affect watersheds and the ecosystem services they supply to growing western communities. Procedures\/Methods: We will leverage existing datasets and models to accomplish our objective. We will couple existing wildfire simulations from multiple GCMs from the USGS LandCarbon project through 2050. The wildfire simulations will be used to inform potential vegetation change as a result of fire, then used in the InVEST Sediment Retention Model to determine present and future sedimentation rates. We will also incorporate population and housing growth projections, developed for the EPA\u2019s Integrated Climate and Land Use Scenarios project and following the IPCC SRES storylines, to account for growing population pressures and how they will change water demand. The results will be combined to assess the importance of watersheds to surface drinking water and their potential vulnerability under climate change. Finally, the Landscape Treatment Designer program will be used to design and explore spatially explicit landscape fuel treatment scenarios to reduce the potential vulnerability of western watersheds. Expected Products and Info\/Tech Transfer: Our plan for technology and information transfer is focused on outreach and applied use of our data products (primarily watershed vulnerability maps) and models (InVEST sediment retention). Through the western JFSP wildland fire consortia, LCC, and CSC communities we will give webinars, contribute fact sheets, and collaborative explore project scenarios with scientists and managers. Our products could also be used directly within wildfire management systems, specifically: 1) WFDSS, to identify watershed or subwatershed areas sensitive to post-fire erosion, 2) RAVAR, for determining values threatened by wildland fire, and 3) IFTDSS, for fuel treatment planning and prioritization."},{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"COA","value":"MS3445"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":194032,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2014","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":94476},{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":99556}]},{"facetName":"Expando","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ExpandoFacet"}],"files":[{"imageWidth":1598,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":785651,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2016-03-16T17:46:07.000Z","name":"NW-2014-1_Fire_BoulderCO_BrianEbel_USGS.JPG","pathOnDisk":"__disk__a1\/58\/8a\/a1588aef49ef7af258a1a1f1f7116eeb4870025e","title":"Fire near Boulder, CO - Credit: Brian Ebel, USGS","contentType":"image\/jpeg","imageHeight":1198,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/531dc54de4b04cb293ee7806?f=__disk__a1%2F58%2F8a%2Fa1588aef49ef7af258a1a1f1f7116eeb4870025e"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/531dc54de4b04cb293ee7806?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/531dc54de4b04cb293ee7806?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=531dc54de4b04cb293ee7806&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=531dc54de4b04cb293ee7806&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=531dc54de4b04cb293ee7806&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=531dc54de4b04cb293ee7806","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/531dc54de4b04cb293ee7806\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/531dc54de4b04cb293ee7806","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"ChangestoWaters.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Jason R Kreitler","Joel B Sankey","Todd J Hawbaker","Nicole Vaillant","Scott Lowe"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"],"funding_years":"2014","fy":"2014"},"50477198e4b067bd38f7f4fb":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"50477198e4b067bd38f7f4fb","title":"Cheatgrass dieoff in Northern Great Basin Final Report","body":"<p>Cheatgrass began invading the Great Basin about 100 years ago, changing large parts of the landscape from a rich, diverse ecosystem to one where a single invasive species dominates. Cheatgrass is highly flammable; consequently, cheatgrass-dominated areas experience more fires that burn more land than in native ecosystems, resulting in economic and resource losses. Therefore, the reduced production, or absence, of cheatgrass in previously invaded areas during years of adequate precipitation could be seen as a windfall. However, this cheatgrass dieoff phenomenon creates other problems for land managers such as accelerated soil erosion, loss of early spring food supply for livestock and wildlife, and unknown recovery pathways. We used satellite data and scientific techniques to map annual estimated cheatgrass percent cover and areas of cheatgrass dieoff in the western and central parts of the northern Great Basin from 2000 to 2010. For this same area, we developed a map of cheatgrass percent cover variability and another map that displays cheatgrass dieoff probability.<\/p> \n<p>These maps can assist land managers in understanding when and where cheatgrass did and did not exist over an extremely large landscape, and can possibly explain characteristics of dieoff areas that can help researchers pinpoint the cause or causes of cheatgrass dieoff. The cheatgrass dieoff maps show that dieoff areas are spatially and temporally variable; in other words, a dieoff may impact an area for a few years and then cheatgrass may return, only to dieoff again later. This pattern of variability also persists in different areas. During the study period, we estimated that, on average, about 2.6 million acres experienced cheatgrass dieoff annually. Restoring dieoff areas to a native ecosystem could be land management\u2019s goal, but until cheatgrass dieoff causes and natural recovery pathways are better understood, engaging in costly restoration activities may be unwise.<\/p>","purpose":"The proposal\u2019s original objectives were to 1) facilitate an effective monitoring project that provided science-based information on dieoff magnitude and trends; and 2) provide robust data to inform predictive models and analytical tools for current and future management. To meet these objectives we produced a cheatgrass dieoff model to map annual cheatgrass dieoff from 2000 to 2010.","parentId":"502aa00ae4b0a8e4a0fdb174","contacts":[{"name":"Bruce K

However, if forests can be managed to retain snow longer, some of these environmental and financial impacts may be mitigated. Recent results from our research team demonstrate that in areas with relatively warm winters, strategically-cut forest gaps could offset climatic warming by increasing snow retention on the landscape and delaying runoff. However, in areas with colder winters, the opposite is true, as snow lasts longer under the forest canopy. We will map these climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect snow duration in different locations and testing those predictions against careful observations from our field sites and a network of citizen scientists. Working with regional forest and water managers, we will identify strategies for applying these findings to decision-making, linking climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management. Results from this project will help managers to act strategically to maximize snow retention (protecting forests in some areas while opening gaps in others), providing more water later in the season for hydropower, agriculture, and fish flows.","parentId":"541b07bee4b01571b3d654fc","contacts":[{"name":"Jessica Lundquist","oldPartyId":66563,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jdlund@u.washington.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Jessica","lastName":"Lundquist","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Susan E.

To effectively manage sagebrush steppe landscapes for long-term goals, managers need information about the potential impacts of climate change, disturbances, and management activities. We integrated information from a dynamic global vegetation model, a sage-grouse habitat climate envelope model, and a state-and-transition simulation model to project broad-scale vegetation dynamics and potential sage-grouse habitat across 23.5 million acres in southeastern Oregon. We evaluated four climate scenarios, including continuing current climate and three scenarios of global climate change, and three management scenarios, including no management, current management and a sage-grouse habitat restoration scenario. All climate change scenarios projected expansion of moist shrub steppe and contraction of dry shrub steppe, but climate scenarios varied widely in the projected extent of xeric shrub steppe, where hot, dry summer conditions are unfavorable for sage-grouse. Wildfire increased by 26% over the century under current climate due to exotic grass encroachment, and by two- to four-fold across all climate change scenarios as extreme fire years became more frequent. Exotic grasses rapidly expanded in all scenarios as large areas of the landscape initially in semi-degraded condition converted to exotic-dominated systems. Due to the combination of exotic grass invasion, juniper encroachment, and climatic unsuitability for sage-grouse, projected sage-grouse habitat declined in the first several decades, but increased in area under the three climate change scenarios later in the century, as moist shrub steppe increased and rangeland condition improved. Management activities in the model were generally unsuccessful in controlling exotic grass invasion but were effective in slowing woodland expansion. Current levels of restoration treatments were insufficient to prevent some juniper expansion, but increased treatment rates under the restoration scenario maintained juniper near initial levels in priority treatment areas. Our simulations indicate that climate change may have both positive and negative implications for maintaining sage-grouse habitat.","parentId":"50465355e4b0241d49d62c8b","contacts":[{"name":"Megan K.

Will they be stable or unstable? Will the waters be cold and clear or warm and muddy? Will they have salmon or other species? These questions motivated our two-year study of climate warming effects on headwater streams draining the Cascade Mountains. Using a novel combination of snow, geohydrology, and sediment transport models we assessed the vulnerability of stream channels to changing peak streamflow. Our snow modeling shows that with just a 2\u00b0C warming, snowfall shifts to rainfall at all elevations, peak snowpacks occur over two months earlier, and snowpacks are reduced by over half of historical values. Our geohydrology modeling shows that greater rainfall and earlier snowmelt enhances peak winter streamflows but impacts depend on snow amount and watershed geohydrology. In spring-fed watersheds, increased winter flows are within historical bounds. In runoff-dominated watersheds, increased winter flows will exceed the historical range by up to 44% and the frequency of high flows will increase by over 100 days per year. Since streambed gravels and sand are transported during high flows, climate warming is likely to result in a dramatic increase in the amount of sediment moving through Cascade streams. Daily sediment transport rates in the surface-runoff system could potentially double. Besides affecting water quality with increased levels of suspended sediment, more frequent sediment transport events may lead to instability in the gravels where bull trout and salmon lay their eggs, making their survival less certain in the future. A key aspect of this project was engaging managers through a knowledge- to-action approach. Stakeholder dialogues were held in organized workshops and informal discussions through which we shared needs, information, and knowledge to interpret the consequences of these projected changes for water supply, threatened and endangered aquatic species, and dam operations.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"5006c2c9e4b0abf7ce733f42","contacts":[{"name":"Anne Nolin","type":"Principal

wildfire changes will complicate future management of native coldwater fishes in fire-prone landscapes, and new approaches to management that incorporate uncertainty are needed to address this challenge. We used a Bayesian network (BN) approach to evaluate population vulnerability of bull trout ( \n<em>Salvelinus confluentus<\/em>) in the Wenatchee River basin, Washington, USA, under current and future climate and fire scenarios. The BN was based on modeled estimates of wildfire, water temperature, and physical habitat prior to, and following, simulated fires throughout the basin. We found that bull trout population vulnerability depended on the extent to which climate effects can be at least partially offset by managing factors such as habitat connectivity and fire size. Moreover, our analysis showed that local management can significantly reduce the vulnerability of bull trout to climate change given appropriate management actions. Tools such as our BN that explicitly integrate the linked nature of climate and wildfire, and incorporate uncertainty in both input data and vulnerability estimates, will be vital in effective future management to conserve native coldwater fishes.","parentId":"502a9e8fe4b0a8e4a0fdb164","contacts":[{"name":"Jeffrey A.

Many species are moving in directions and at rates that correspond with recent climatic change. Understanding how species distributions and abundances are likely to be altered can inform management and planning activities resulting in more robust management. We projected climate-driven changes in the abundances and distributions of 31 focal bird species in Oregon and Washington using the latest downscaled CMIP5 climate projections and corresponding vegetation model outputs. We mapped these future projections and integrated them into an existing web-based tool (<a href=\"http:\/\/data.pointblue.org\/apps\/nwcsc\/\">http:\/\/data.pointblue.org\/apps\/nwcsc\/<\/a>) to allow managers and planners to access and download the projections. Our model outputs forecast significant changes in vegetation across much of Washington and Oregon by the end of the century. These changes are particularly dramatic east of the Cascade Mountains. Our bird models project much less dramatic changes in avian communities across the two states, but those changes tend to be largest in the Olympic and Cascade Mountains as well as across portions of the Columbia Plateau and in eastern and southeastern Oregon. Despite the smaller changes in avian communities, our models do project significant changes in abundance for some species in specific locations ranging from large increases to local extirpations. Our results also show that for some bird species, vegetation model projections are particularly important for forecasting changes in abundances and distributions. For example, Columbia Plateau Low Sagebrush Steppe and Shrubland, Northern Rocky Mountain-Vancouverian Montane-Foothill Grassland, and Great Basin and Intermountain (Sagebrush) Shrubland and Steppe were particularly important predictors for Oregon Vesper Sparrow (<em>Pooecetes gramineus affinis<\/em>). Dynamic general vegetation model (DGVM) outputs, such as fire, fuels, and carbon were important predictors of these habitat types. In conclusion our results forecast significant climate-driven changes in vegetation for the region and highlight areas where nuanced management actions will be warranted.","parentId":"531899cce4b051b1b924ea01","contacts":[{"name":"John Kim","type":"Co-Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USDA U.S. Forest Service"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"97331","country":"United States","city":"Corvallis","state":"OR","line1":"3200 SW Jefferson Way"}}},{"name":"Joshua Lawler","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jlawler@u.washington.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Sam Veloz","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Point Blue"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Leo Salas","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Point Blue"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Robert Altman","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"American Bird Conservancy"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"John Alexander","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Klamath Bird Observatory"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"avian vulnerability tool"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"dynamic global vegetation models"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"bird species distributions"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Location","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Location","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Northwest CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-09-01","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2016-03-31","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-03-10T08:31:03.067-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2017-01-03T17:13:10.995-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"Completed","facetName":"Project","projectProducts":[{"_class":"ProjectProduct","productDescription":"http:\/\/data.pointblue.org\/apps\/nwcsc\/","status":"Delivered"}],"parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Technical Summary","value":"The overall goal of this project was to update and improve the existing Avian Vulnerability Tool by extending the geographic extent and by integrating new data and vegetation projections from a DGVM into the tool.

While all the CMIP5 temperature projections agree on a substantial level of warming throughout the year, there is fair bit of divergence in the magnitude and seasonality of projected changes in rainfall. While desert plants and animals are generally adapted to extreme conditions, some species may be approaching their physiological threshold. We calculated the climate velocity of both temperature and aridity (PPT\/PET) in SE California to illustrate the spatial variability of climate projections and reported on the probable expansion of barren lands reducing current species survivorship. We used a vegetation model to illustrate both temporal and spatial shifts in land cover in response to changes in environmental conditions. Such information is useful to plan land use for renewable energy siting in the region.","parentId":"50463e10e4b0241d49d62c35","contacts":[{"name":"Dominique Bachelet","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Conservation Biology Institute"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Ken Ferschweiler","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Conservation Biology Institute"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Tim Sheehan","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Oregon State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"James Strittholt","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Conservation Biology Institute"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0140196315300677","title":"Bachelet et al. 2016","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"CMIP5"},{"name":"Models"},{"name":"temperature"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2016-04","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-03-17T13:06:43.975-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-03-17T13:08:33.252-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Journal of Arid Environments","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Volume","value":"127"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Pages","value":"17-29"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Dominique Bachelet","Ken Ferschweiler","Tim Sheehan","James Strittholt"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"586d8d0de4b0f5ce109fca03":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/531dcca7e4b04cb293ee787e","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Climate Change Maps","relatedTitle":"Climate Change Avian Vulnerability Visualization and Analysis Tool for Land Managers: Expansion to NW CSC with Dynamic Vegetation Simulations","id":"586d8d0de4b0f5ce109fca03","relatedId":"531dcca7e4b04cb293ee787e","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/586d8d0de4b0f5ce109fca03","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Climate Change Avian Vulnerability Visualization and Analysis Tool for Land Managers: Expansion to NW CSC with Dynamic Vegetation Simulations","relatedTitle":"Climate Change Maps","id":"531dcca7e4b04cb293ee787e","relatedId":"586d8d0de4b0f5ce109fca03","annotation":null}]},"id":"586d8d0de4b0f5ce109fca03","title":"Climate Change Maps","body":"These maps indicate the magnitude of multivariate climate change using the standardized Euclidean distance (SED).

These maps are based on multiple climate models ( CanESM2, MIROC5, MIROC_ESM_CHEM, and MRI_CGCM3 climate models ) for the periods 2035-2064 and 2070-2099 and are based on bioclimatic variables and seasonal climate variables..","purpose":"Terrestrial ecosystems are vulnerable to future changes in the global climate, including increased temperatures, and changing precipitation patterns.

A stakeholders\u2019 workshop was held, which was attended by local politicians; federal, state and NGO resource managers; ranchers and&nbsp;farmers; and Tribal representatives. Products from the workshop included stakeholder-defined goals for adapting to climate change.&nbsp;An important aspect of adaptation of aquatic resources in the Methow Basin is the role of habitat connectivity on the ability of native fishes to obtain food.&nbsp;Native fishes participate in feeding both as predators and as prey.&nbsp;With funds from the Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative&nbsp;and the Northwest Climate Science Center (NW CSC), we examined the influence of temperature, habitat availability, and flow under normal conditions and under climate change scenarios to simulate growth and consumption by fish and estimate the potential impact of predation on juvenile ESA-listed salmon.&nbsp;Specific tasks included: (1) determining if large bodied fish (bull trout, cutthroat trout, and mountain whitefish) feeding in the mainstem Columbia River experience increased growth, which increases their predation on juvenile salmon in the Methow River; (2) developing parameters for bioenergetics models for bull trout and mountain whitefish to predict their growth under predicted climate change scenarios; and (3) determining current and potentially available side-channel connectivity, which provides rearing areas and refugia from predation for juvenile fish, in the mainstem Methow River. With NW CSC funds we modeled possible effects of climate change on fish habitat by completing the side channel assessment and combining that with existing tributary and mainstem models that predict flow under several climate change scenarios.&nbsp;These predicted changes will be run through an existing fish habitat decision support system to predict changes in habitat.<\/p>","parentId":"5006c1e5e4b0abf7ce733f3b","linkParentIds":["521e1ecde4b051c878dc356f"],"contacts":[{"name":"Michael

Persistence Following Wildfire","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/abs\/10.3955\/046.089.0305):&nbsp;It is hypothesized that climate impacts forest mosaics through dynamic ecological processes such as wildfires. However, climate-fire research has primarily focused on understanding drivers of fire frequency and area burned, largely due to scale mismatches and limited data availability. Recent datasets, however, allow for the investigation of climate influences on ecological patch metrics across broad regions independent of area burned and at finer scale. One area of particular interest is the distribution of fire refugia within wildfire perimeters. Although much recent research emphasis has been placed on high-severity patches within wildfires, unburned and low-severity patches provide critical remnant habitat and serve as seed sources to initiate colonization and succession in recently burned landscapes. These patches of persistence also may yield insights into approaches for developing fire-resilient landscapes by forest managers and communities seeking to reduce wildfire hazard. Here, we present results showing no decline in proportion of persistent patches in three study areas surrounding National Parks in the western United States, even as research and anecdotal information suggests that fires have become larger and more severe. We also show climate linkages to metrics of persistence that echo previous findings in climate-fire research, and we introduce a framework for addressing global change impacts on forest pattern more broadly. Specifically, we discuss the interactions of multiple drivers at landscape scales and the need to disaggregate relative influences using mixed methods that can address both social and ecological phenomenon.","parentId":"53189314e4b051b1b924e9e5","contacts":[{"name":"Crystal A.

The climatic drivers of this recent mortality and the potential for future whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetle are not well understood, yet are important considerations in whether to list whitebark pine as a threatened or endangered species. We sought to increase the understanding of climate influences on mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine forests, which are less well understood than in lodgepole pine, by quantifying climate-beetle relationships, analyzing climate influences during the recent outbreak, and estimating the suitability of future climate for beetle outbreaks. We developed a statistical model of the probability of whitebark pine mortality in the GYE that included temperature effects on beetle development and survival, precipitation effects on host tree condition, beetle population size, and stand characteristics. Estimated probability of whitebark pine mortality increased with higher winter minimum temperature, indicating greater beetle winter survival; higher fall temperature, indicating synchronous beetle emergence; lower two-year summer precipitation, indicating increased potential for host tree stress; increasing beetle populations; stand age; and increasing percent composition of whitebark pine within a stand. The recent outbreak occurred during a period of higher-than-normal regional winter temperatures, suitable fall temperatures, and low summer precipitation. In contrast to lodgepole pine systems, area with mortality was linked to precipitation variability even at high beetle populations. Projections from climate models indicate future climate conditions will likely provide favorable conditions for beetle outbreaks within nearly all current whitebark pine habitat in the GYE by the middle of this century. Therefore, when surviving and regenerating trees reach ages suitable for beetle attack, there is strong potential for continued whitebark pine mortality due to mountain pine beetle.","parentId":"50465652e4b0241d49d62c9a","contacts":[{"name":"Polly C.

Northwest: A Comparison of Three Approaches","body":"<p>Climate change is already affecting species in many ways. Because individual species respond to climate change differently, some will be adversely affected by climate change whereas others may benefit. Successfully managing species in a changing climate will require an understanding of which species will be most and least impacted by climate change. Although several approaches have been proposed for assessing the vulnerability of species to climate change, it is unclear whether these approaches are likely to produce similar results. In this study, we compared the relative vulnerabilities to climate change of 76 species of birds, mammals, amphibians, and trees based on three different approaches to assessing vulnerability. We compared (1) projected shifts in species distributions to (2) an assessment based on expert opinion and projected changes in climate to (3) an approach based on the current and future climatic conditions within species\u2019 current ranges. We found that the three approaches provided substantially different rankings of the species. Some species were determined to be highly vulnerable by one approach but only moderately vulnerable by the other two approaches. Only one species, the caribou, was consistently ranked in the top ten most vulnerable species by all three approaches. This is not entirely surprising given that the three measures assess different aspects of vulnerability and are based on different types of information. Nonetheless, these results are important because they indicate that more than one approach may be needed to adequately assess vulnerability and that basing management decisions on one approach alone may lead scientists and managers to underestimate vulnerability.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n","parentId":"5006c2c9e4b0abf7ce733f42","contacts":[{"name":"Joshua Lawler","type":"Principal

Here, we introduce a novel modeling framework for aquatic systems that integrates spatially-explicit, individual-based, demographic and genetic (demogenetic) assessments with environmental variables. To show its potential utility, we simulated a hypothetical network of 19 migratory riverine populations (e.g., salmonids) using a riverscape connectivity and demogenetic model (CDFISH). We assessed how stream resistance to movement -- a function of water temperature, fluvial distance, and physical barriers -- might influence demogenetic connectivity and hence population vulnerability. We present demographic metrics (abundance, immigration, and change in abundance) and also genetic metrics (diversity, differentiation, and change in differentiation), and combine them into a single vulnerability index for identifying populations at risk of extirpation. We considered four realistic scenarios that illustrate the relative sensitivity of these metrics for early detection of reduced connectivity: (1) maximum resistance due to high water temperatures throughout the network, (2) minimum resistance due to low water temperatures throughout the network, (3) increased resistance at a tributary junction caused by a partial barrier, and (4) complete isolation of a tributary, leaving resident individuals only. We then apply this demogenetic framework using empirical data for a bull trout metapopulation in the upper Flathead River system, Canada and USA, to assess how current and predicted future stream warming may influence population vulnerability. Results suggest that warmer water temperatures and associated barriers to movement (e.g., low flows, de-watering) are predicted to fragment suitable habitat for migratory salmonids, resulting in the loss of genetic diversity and reduced sizes in certain vulnerable population. This demogenetic simulation framework, which is illustrated in a web-based interactive mapping prototype (http:\/\/ptolemy.dbs.umt.edu\/pvm\/), should be useful for evaluating population vulnerability in a wide variety of dendritic and fragmented riverscapes, helping to guide conservation and management efforts for freshwater species.","parentId":"50465251e4b0241d49d62c7c","contacts":[{"name":"E.

A key change from CMIP3 to CMIP5 is the change in scenarios of projected greenhouse gas concentrations during the 21st century. Other notable advancements from CMIP3 to CMIP5 include finer spatial resolution, the prescription of land use change (past and future), and, for some global climate models, simulations of the carbon cycle and atmospheric chemistry. CMIP5 model runs indicate a warmer future in the Pacific Northwest than those from CMIP3, while both modeling experiments suggest a slightly wetter future.","parentId":"50463e10e4b0241d49d62c35","contacts":[{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.doi.gov\/csc\/northwest\/upload\/CMIP5-v-CMIP3-two-pager.pdf","title":"Two-page Information Sheet","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"CMIP3"},{"name":"CMIP5"},{"name":"climate change"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-02-21T09:30:04.305-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-03-02T11:22:24.875-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"5006f56be4b0abf7ce733fa1":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"5006f56be4b0abf7ce733fa1","title":"Contribution of Landscape Characteristics and Vegetation Shifts from Global Climate Change to Long-Term Viability of Greater Sage-grouse","body":"<p>Greater sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus<\/em>) is a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act because of population and habitat fragmentation combined with inadequate regulatory mechanisms to control development in critical areas. In addition to the current threats to habitat, each 1 degree celsius&nbsp;increase in temperature due to climate change is expected to result in an additional 87,000 km2 of sagebrush (<em>Artemisia spp.<\/em>) that will be converted to unsuitable habitat for sage-grouse. Thus, the future distribution and composition of sagebrush landscapes is likely to differ greatly from today\u2019s configuration. We conducted a large, multi-objective project to identify: (1) characteristics of habitats required by sage-grouse, (2) spatial organization of breeding populations of sage-grouse across their entire range, (3) current and future distribution of sagebrush landscapes, and (4) connectivity of habitat and sage-grouse populations. Ultimately, the project will provide an understanding of sage-grouse response to spatial and temporal changes in their environment. This information will permit managers to estimate population vulnerability to stochastic or environmental risks and will aid decisions about allocating limited resources for conservation.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>Spatial organization of breeding populations (Objective 2) can best be delineated from genetic data. Funding from the Northwest&nbsp;Climate Science Center (NW CSC) was used to develop a peer-reviewed study plan that develops the scientific foundation for the range-wide genetic connectivity study. Funding from the NW CSC also was used to process genetic data in a preliminary sample of sage-grouse feathers collected in the northwest portion of the sage-grouse range. Funding from other federal and state agencies supported additional genetic analyses, development of landscape models delineating cost-surfaces, and assessment of features that influence genetic relatedness among sage-grouse populations.<\/p>","parentId":"5006c1e5e4b0abf7ce733f3b","contacts":[{"name":"Steven T Knick","oldPartyId":5573,"type":"Principal

However, climate change is now proceeding so quickly that it is becoming difficult for species to move fast enough to keep pace. In addition, today\u2019s landscapes feature significant barriers to movement presented by human land uses (e.g., roads, cities, farms). Such is the case in the region around the border of Washington and British Columbia, where increasing development pressure and limited coordination of land and wildlife management across the border pose a threat to the future ability of wildlife to move as the climate changes. The Washington-British Columbia Transboundary Climate-Connectivity Project sought to address this problem by building the capacity of land and wildlife managers in the transboundary region to incorporate climate change and wildlife movement into their decision-making. The project paired climate scientists with land and wildlife managers from both sides of the border to work together to anticipate how climate change may impact wildlife movement and identify actions for addressing these impacts, so that their management of the landscape and the wildlife within it would be better prepared for future change. Products are freely available via an online tool that allows users to view and download reports, maps, and other project products describing potential climate impacts and management responses for a diverse group of plants and animals living in the transboundary region. Together, this effort and its products have enhanced the ability of land and wildlife managers in Washington and British Columbia to collaboratively respond to future threats to regional wildlife movement, enhancing the resilience of our shared species and ecosystems.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<\/div>","parentId":"531899cce4b051b1b924ea01","contacts":[{"name":"Meade Krosby","type":"Principal

\n<br \/> 1. Consists of comparing results of the indexing method MTCLIM to estimate incoming short and long wave radiation, to observations, to BSRN station data, and to three Ameriflux towers in the Pacific Northwest.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> 2. Reports on forcing VIC with downscaled GCM forcings, with variations in two forcing variables: downward shortwave radiation (rad) and specific humidity (qair). For this task we consider the MACA downscaling method. Three cases are reported: a) both variables are downscaled; b) rad is indexed and qair is downscaled; c) rad is downscaled and qair is indexed.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> 3.&nbsp;Reports on forcing VIC with downscaled GCM forcing, with 5 variations in the downscaling methods. For this task, in contrast to task 2, rad and qair are always downscaled. Runs with five downscaling methods reported: a) dBCSD; b) MACA; c) mBCSD; d) NARCCAP; e) sdbcNARCCAP (or bcNARCCAP).\n<br \/> \n<br \/> Tasks 2 and 3 share the following characteristics:\n<br \/> \n<br \/> 1. The downscaled data corresponds to the CCSM3e GCM model run. All downscaling was \u201ctrained\u201d with the gridded Livneh et al., 2013 data set, downloaded in July 2012.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> 2. &nbsp;Only 4 pixels of the domain were selected for the figures in the final report of the project and stored in this repository, even though the model was set up and run for the whole pacific northwest domain. Though we carried out runs for 2 scenarios, here we only present the future SRES A2 scenario results.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> 3. The version of the code used was VIC version 4.1.2.g, with several improvements which have been incorporated into VIC version 4.1.2.h. The compiled executable is included in this directory and the sourcecode can be found online at http:\/\/www.hydro.washington.edu\/Lettenmaier\/Models\/VIC\/.&nbsp;\n<br \/> \n<br \/> 4. The model parameters correspond to those used by Livneh et al., 2013, for the continental US portion of the Pacific Northwest.

experimental modification of precipitation seasonality and soil depth: relationship to the two-layer model and ecohydrological niche","body":"<p>1. Ecohydrological niches are important for understanding plant community responses to climate shifts, particularly in dry lands. According to the two-layer hypothesis, selective use of deep-soil water increases growth or persistence of woody species during warm and dry summer periods and thereby contributes to their coexistence with shallow-rooted herbs in dry ecosystems. The resource-pool hypothesis further suggests that shallow-soil water benefits growth of all plants while deep-soil water primarily enhances physiological maintenance and survival of woody species. Few studies have directly tested these by manipulating deep-soil water availability and observing the long-term outcomes.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>2. We predicted that factors promoting infiltration and storage of water in deep soils, specifically greater winter precipitation and soil depth, would enhance <i>Artemisia tridentata<\/i> (big sagebrush) in cold, winter-wet\/summer-dry desert. Sagebrush responses to 20 years of winter irrigation were compared to summer- or no irrigation, on plots having relatively deep or shallow soils (2 m vs. 1 m depths).<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>3. Winter irrigation increased sagebrush cover, and crown and canopy volumes, but not density (individuals\/plot) compared to summer or no irrigation, on deep-soil plots. On shallow-soil plots, winter irrigation surprisingly decreased shrub cover and size, and summer irrigation had no effect. Furthermore, multiple regression suggested that the variations in growth were related (i) firstly to water in shallow soils (0-0.2 m) and secondly to deeper soils (&gt; 1 m deep) and (ii) more by springtime than by midsummer soil water. Water-use efficiency increased considerably on shallow soils without irrigation and was lowest with winter irrigation.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>4. <i>Synthesis<\/i>. Sagebrush was more responsive to the seasonal timing of precipitation than to total annual precipitation. Factors that enhanced deep-water storage (deeper soils plus more winter precipitation) led to increases in <i>Artemisia tridentata<\/i> that were consistent with the two-layer hypothesis, and the contribution of shallow water to growth on these plots was consistent with the resource-pool hypothesis. However, shallow-soil water also had negative effects on sagebrush, suggesting an ecohydrological trade-off not considered in these or related theories. The interaction between precipitation timing and soil depth indicates that increased winter precipitation could lead to a mosaic of increases and decreases in <i>A. tridentata<\/i> across landscapes having variable soil depth.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["504665cce4b0241d49d62cbd"],"contacts":[{"name":"Matthew J.

However, fire activity is expected to increase given the current rate of climate change, with uncertain outcomes. A fire impact that has not been widely addressed is the development of unburned islands; areas within the fire perimeter that do not burn. These areas function as critical ecological refugia for biota during or following wildfires, but they have been largely ignored in methodological studies of remote sensing assessing fire severity under the assumption that they will be detected by algorithms for delineating fire perimeters. Our objective was to develop a model for classifying unburned areas within wildfire perimeters using moderate resolution satellite (i.e., Landsat) and ancillary data. We performed field observations at locations that were unburned or lightly burned within the perimeters of 12 wildfires that burned in 2012 and 2014, and augmented this with field data previously acquired on another seven wildfires across the study region. We used randomForest and classification trees to separate burned from unburned locations with high overall classification accuracy (91.7% and 89.2%, for randomForest and classification tree methods respectively). Classification accuracy was significantly higher than the semi-automated classification products from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) program. After application of the most parsimonious and accurate classification tree model, we found that the average unburned proportion of the fires was 20% with high variability between fires (standard deviation: 16.4%). The total area of unburned islands in non-forested areas was significantly higher than the total unburned area in forested areas. Accurate detection and delineation of unburned areas is increasingly critical, as some of these unburned areas contain habitat (i.e., wildfire refugia) that are crucial for maintaining biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems, particularly given observed and projected anthropogenic climate change.","parentId":"53189314e4b051b1b924e9e5","contacts":[{"name":"Arjan J.H.

assess the current topography of tidal marsh at the study sites we conducted survey-grade global positioning system (GPS) surveys between 2009 and 2014 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK GPS network coverage (Padilla, Port Susan, Nisqually, Siletz, Bull Island, and Bandon), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem. At sites without network coverage (Skokomish, Grays Harbor, and Willapa), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. At sites where we used the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov\/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning and referenced positions to a local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmark or a benchmark established by a surveyor (Figure 4). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-9 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. To measure topographic variation at each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines (Appendix Figs. A1 \u2013 I1). We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid measurements (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 using Leica GeoOffice v7.0.1 (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA).In ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013, Redlands, CA), we created a digital elevation model (DEM) for each site using each sites survey elevation data points. We processed the elevation point data with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size) while adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square (RMS) error to create the best model fit for the DEM (Table 2). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones.","purpose":"At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions. Overall tidal range decreased from northern Washington to southern Oregon.","parentId":"554cd7d2e4b082ec54129d68","contacts":[{"name":"Karen M Thorne","oldPartyId":13502,"type":"Process

The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions. Overall tidal range decreased from northern Washington to southern Oregon.","parentId":"554cd7d2e4b082ec54129d68","contacts":[{"name":"Karen M Thorne","oldPartyId":13502,"type":"Point of

Washington","body":"To assess the current topography of tidal marsh at the study sites we conducted survey-grade global positioning system (GPS) surveys between 2009 and 2014 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK GPS network coverage (Padilla, Port Susan, Nisqually, Siletz, Bull Island, and Bandon), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem. At sites without network coverage (Skokomish, Grays Harbor, and Willapa), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. At sites where we used the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov\/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning and referenced positions to a local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmark or a benchmark established by a surveyor (Figure 4). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-9 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. To measure topographic variation at each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines (Appendix Figs. A1 \u2013 I1). We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid measurements (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 using Leica GeoOffice v7.0.1 (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA).In ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013, Redlands, CA), we created a digital elevation model (DEM) for each site using each sites survey elevation data points. We processed the elevation point data with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size) while adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square (RMS) error to create the best model fit for the DEM (Table 2). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones.","purpose":"At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies.

Washington","body":"To assess the current topography of tidal marsh at the study sites we conducted survey-grade global positioning system (GPS) surveys between 2009 and 2014 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK GPS network coverage (Padilla, Port Susan, Nisqually, Siletz, Bull Island, and Bandon), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem. At sites without network coverage (Skokomish, Grays Harbor, and Willapa), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. At sites where we used the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov\/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning and referenced positions to a local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmark or a benchmark established by a surveyor (Figure 4). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-9 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. To measure topographic variation at each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines (Appendix Figs. A1 \u2013 I1). We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid measurements (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 using Leica GeoOffice v7.0.1 (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA).In ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013, Redlands, CA), we created a digital elevation model (DEM) for each site using each sites survey elevation data points. We processed the elevation point data with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size) while adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square (RMS) error to create the best model fit for the DEM (Table 2). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones.","purpose":"At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions. Overall tidal range decreased from northern Washington to southern Oregon.","parentId":"554cd7d2e4b082ec54129d68","contacts":[{"name":"Karen M Thorne","oldPartyId":13502,"type":"Point of

Time Kinematic (RTK) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK GPS network coverage (Padilla, Port Susan, Nisqually, Siletz, Bull Island, and Bandon), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem. At sites without network coverage (Skokomish, Grays Harbor, and Willapa), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. At sites where we used the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov\/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning and referenced positions to a local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmark or a benchmark established by a surveyor (Figure 4). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-9 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. To measure topographic variation at each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines (Appendix Figs. A1 \u2013 I1). We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid measurements (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 using Leica GeoOffice v7.0.1 (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA).In ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013, Redlands, CA), we created a digital elevation model (DEM) for each site using each sites survey elevation data points. We processed the elevation point data with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size) while adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square (RMS) error to create the best model fit for the DEM (Table 2). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones.","purpose":"At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast.

The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3).

Washington","body":"To assess the current topography of tidal marsh at the study sites we conducted survey-grade global positioning system (GPS) surveys between 2009 and 2014 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK GPS network coverage (Padilla, Port Susan, Nisqually, Siletz, Bull Island, and Bandon), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem. At sites without network coverage (Skokomish, Grays Harbor, and Willapa), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. At sites where we used the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov\/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning and referenced positions to a local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmark or a benchmark established by a surveyor (Figure 4). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-9 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. To measure topographic variation at each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines (Appendix Figs. A1 \u2013 I1). We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid measurements (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 using Leica GeoOffice v7.0.1 (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA).In ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013, Redlands, CA), we created a digital elevation model (DEM) for each site using each sites survey elevation data points. We processed the elevation point data with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size) while adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square (RMS) error to create the best model fit for the DEM (Table 2). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones.","purpose":"At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions. Overall tidal range decreased from northern Washington to southern Oregon.","parentId":"554cd7d2e4b082ec54129d68","contacts":[{"name":"Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research

Washington","body":"To assess the current topography of tidal marsh at the study sites we conducted survey-grade global positioning system (GPS) surveys between 2009 and 2014 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK GPS network coverage (Padilla, Port Susan, Nisqually, Siletz, Bull Island, and Bandon), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem. At sites without network coverage (Skokomish, Grays Harbor, and Willapa), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. At sites where we used the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov\/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning and referenced positions to a local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmark or a benchmark established by a surveyor (Figure 4). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-9 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. To measure topographic variation at each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines (Appendix Figs. A1 \u2013 I1). We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid measurements (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 using Leica GeoOffice v7.0.1 (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA).In ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013, Redlands, CA), we created a digital elevation model (DEM) for each site using each sites survey elevation data points. We processed the elevation point data with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size) while adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square (RMS) error to create the best model fit for the DEM (Table 2). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones.","purpose":"At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions. Overall tidal range decreased from northern Washington to southern Oregon.","parentId":"554cd7d2e4b082ec54129d68","contacts":[{"name":"Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research

Refugia: Identifying Trends and Resilience in Unburned Islands under Climate Change","body":"<div>Wildfires are one of the greatest threats to human infrastructure and the ecosystem services humans value in the western US, but are also necessary in fire-adapted ecosystems. Wildfire activity is widely projected to increase in response to climate change in the Northwest, but we currently lack a comprehensive understanding of what this increase will look like or what its impacts will be on a variety of ecological and hydrologic systems. This project is addressing one critical part of those impacts: the islands of unburned vegetation within wildfires. Unburned islands occur naturally as wildfires burn across landscapes, and are important habitat refuges for species; places where plants and animals survive the fire and subsequently regenerate across the recently burned landscape. Since they are naturally resistant to burning, understanding how climate change impacts these islands will help us understand what species may be in even more danger from wildfires if these refuges disappear. Studying them and copying their characteristics can also help humans build our homes and communities to be more resistant to wildfire. This project aims to understand and model unburned islands within wildfires to inform both conservation and restoration planning and community wildfire protection planning efforts.<\/div>\n","parentId":"531899cce4b051b1b924ea01","contacts":[{"name":"Crystal Kolden","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"ckolden@uidaho.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Idaho"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"208-885-6018","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"83844-3021","country":"United States","city":"Moscow","state":"ID","line1":"875 Perimeter Dr. MS 3021"}}},{"name":"John Abatzoglou","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Idaho"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"James Lutz","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Matthew Germino","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Forest and Rangeland Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Carl Key","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Northern Rockies Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jan van Wagtendonk","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Western Ecological Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Nate Benson","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"NPS National Office"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Regina Rochefort","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Cascades National Park"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Cyndi Sidles","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"FWS Pacific Region"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Vita Wright","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Northern Rockies Fire Science Network"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Label","name":"wildfire"},{"type":"Label","name":"burn severity"},{"type":"Label","name":"habitat"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Location","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Location","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Northwest CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-08-25","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2017-08-24","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-03-02T14:24:43.532-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-29T12:06:51.436-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Technical Summary","value":"The primary objectives of this proposal are to 1) identify the climatic factors controlling frequency and distribution of unburned islands in Northwest landscapes impacted by wildfire and 2) test the hypothesis that a warming climate will significantly reduce or eliminate unburned refuges, resulting in smaller fragments of good habitat and lowered ecosystem resilience. Unburned islands within wildfire perimeters are estimated to comprise 20-25% of the area within wildfire perimeters in the western US. They play critical ecological roles, particularly as refugia for flora and fauna during and after wildfire. However, there has been no effort to characterize unburned islands across space and time in order to understand their top-down and bottom-up drivers, particularly climate and land use and land cover. This understanding is critical given the widespread projected increases in wildfire activity across the Pacific Northwest with anthropogenic climate change. In addition, conservation groups, land and fire managers, and urban-interface communities and the private sector need this information to alter management practices or develop new strategies for preserving or promoting the formation of unburned islands during wildfires. To characterize unburned islands, we will conduct two field seasons in 2013 (funded by Idaho NSF EPSCoR) and 2014 (requested here) to collect ground observations of unburned islands and classify spectral maps derived from satellite data. We will then use non-parametric modeling techniques to quantify the relative influence of climate, land use, and fuel treatments on development of unburned islands, and model projected changes in unburned islands formation under climate change. Expected products from this research include peer-reviewed journal articles, webinars delivered to non-technical stakeholders such as land managers and NGO partners through established regional outreach consortia (NRFSN and GNLCC), presentations at conferences, two geospatial databases made publicly available online, and management publications similar to Fact Sheets or research briefs."}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Type","value":"Grant"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Number","value":"G14AP00177"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":362811.74,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2014","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":85109.19},{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":277702.55}]},{"facetName":"Expando","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ExpandoFacet"}],"files":[{"imageWidth":3094,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":2243451,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2016-03-17T20:55:38.000Z","name":"NW-2014-5_Wildfire_YNP_MikeLewelling_NPS.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__a0\/5a\/2d\/a05a2d8e4a65deecd334352d710a5ce9dea5b41a","title":"Wildfire, Yellowstone National Park - Credit: Mike Lewelling, NPS","contentType":"image\/jpeg","imageHeight":2320,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5313a19be4b0123ceff00944?f=__disk__a0%2F5a%2F2d%2Fa05a2d8e4a65deecd334352d710a5ce9dea5b41a"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/5313a19be4b0123ceff00944?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/5313a19be4b0123ceff00944?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=5313a19be4b0123ceff00944&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=5313a19be4b0123ceff00944&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=5313a19be4b0123ceff00944&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=5313a19be4b0123ceff00944","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5313a19be4b0123ceff00944\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5313a19be4b0123ceff00944","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"DisappearingRef.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Crystal Kolden","John Abatzoglou","James Lutz","Matthew Germino","Carl Key","Jan van Wagtendonk","Nate Benson","Regina Rochefort","Cyndi Sidles","Vita Wright"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"],"funding_years":"2014","fy":"2014"},"5006f5d0e4b0abf7ce733fa9":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"5006f5d0e4b0abf7ce733fa9","title":"Disentangling the Effects of Climate and Landscape Change on Bird Population Trends in the Western U.S. and Canada","body":"<p>Climate change has been implicated in the range shifts and population declines of many species, but the confounding of climate change with other variables, particularly landscape change, hampers inference about causation.

This study investigates the potential impacts of climate change on two key ecosystem functions (i.e., water yield and ecosystem productivity) using the most recent climate projections derived from 20 Global Climate Models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). We find that future climate change may result in a significant reduction in water yield but an increase in ecosystem productivity in NFs. On average, gross ecosystem productivity is projected to increase by 76 ~ 229 g C m\u22122 yr\u22121 (8% ~ 24%) while water yield is projected to decrease by 18 ~ 31 mm yr\u22121 (4% ~ 7%) by 2100 as a result of the combination of increased air temperature (+1.8 ~ +5.2 \u00b0C) and precipitation (+17 ~ +51 mm yr\u22121). The notable divergence in ecosystem services of water supply and carbon sequestration is expected to intensify under higher greenhouse gas emission and associated climate change in the future, posing greater challenges to managing NFs for both ecosystem services.","parentId":"50463e10e4b0241d49d62c35","contacts":[{"name":"Kai Duan","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Ge Sun","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USDA Forest Service"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Shanlei Sun","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Peter V.

The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions. Overall tidal range decreased from northern Washington to southern Oregon.","parentId":"554cd7d2e4b082ec54129d68","contacts":[{"name":"Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research

Time Kinematic (RTK) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK GPS network coverage (Padilla, Port Susan, Nisqually, Siletz, Bull Island, and Bandon), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem. At sites without network coverage (Skokomish, Grays Harbor, and Willapa), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. At sites where we used the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov\/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning and referenced positions to a local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmark or a benchmark established by a surveyor (Figure 4). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-9 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. To measure topographic variation at each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines (Appendix Figs. A1 \u2013 I1). We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid measurements (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 using Leica GeoOffice v7.0.1 (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA).The feature class contains elevation surveys conducted at the CERCC Grays Harbor study site.","purpose":"At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions. Overall tidal range decreased from northern Washington to southern Oregon.","parentId":"554cd7d2e4b082ec54129d68","contacts":[{"name":"Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research

assess the current topography of tidal marsh at the study sites we conducted survey-grade global positioning system (GPS) surveys between 2009 and 2014 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK GPS network coverage (Padilla, Port Susan, Nisqually, Siletz, Bull Island, and Bandon), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem. At sites without network coverage (Skokomish, Grays Harbor, and Willapa), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. At sites where we used the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov\/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning and referenced positions to a local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmark or a benchmark established by a surveyor (Figure 4). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-9 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. To measure topographic variation at each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines (Appendix Figs. A1 \u2013 I1). We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid measurements (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 using Leica GeoOffice v7.0.1 (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA).The feature class contains elevation surveys conducted at the CERCC Padilla Bay study site.","purpose":"At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions. Overall tidal range decreased from northern Washington to southern Oregon.","parentId":"554cd7d2e4b082ec54129d68","contacts":[{"name":"Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research

assess the current topography of tidal marsh at the study sites we conducted survey-grade global positioning system (GPS) surveys between 2009 and 2014 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK GPS network coverage (Padilla, Port Susan, Nisqually, Siletz, Bull Island, and Bandon), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem. At sites without network coverage (Skokomish, Grays Harbor, and Willapa), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. At sites where we used the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov\/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning and referenced positions to a local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmark or a benchmark established by a surveyor (Figure 4). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-9 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. To measure topographic variation at each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines (Appendix Figs. A1 \u2013 I1). We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid measurements (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 using Leica GeoOffice v7.0.1 (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA).The feature class contains elevation surveys conducted at the CERCC Willapa Bay study site.","purpose":"At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US.The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions. Overall tidal range decreased from northern Washington to southern Oregon.","parentId":"554cd7d2e4b082ec54129d68","contacts":[{"name":"Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research

Temperature governs the composition of insect communities both spatially as well as temporally. Vannote and Sweeney (1978, 1980) found species have thermal optima where growth and fecundity are maximized. One way to try and determine these optimal temperatures as well as temperature tolerances is through empirical approaches using existing data.

For ESA-listed fish populations there is a strong need for adaptation strategies that reduce the risks of drought-induced fragmentation. While a loud and high profile debate has ensued over the permanent translocation of species (i.e. assisted migration), a unique effort to seasonally translocate fish, termed \u201cfish rescue\u201d, has quietly emerged in the Pacific Northwest. Fish rescue seeks to reduce drought related mortality in wild fish by manually moving individuals from fragmented areas to either free-flowing habitat or artificial rearing facilities, providing refuge during periods of low flow. We propose to empirically and analytically evaluate fish rescue so that managers can make informed decisions about whether to apply this climate change adaptation tool more broadly throughout the region. \t\r\n\r\nWorking with managers, we will develop a coho salmon life-cycle model that quantifies how survival across serial life-stages feeds back into population dynamics. User-parameterized equations will describe the effects of drought-induced fragmentation on juvenile survival and we will provide published parameter estimates for users lacking system-specific data. We will evaluate fish rescue through terms in the model that adjust juvenile and adult survival for the rescued segment of the population. Preliminary data suggest fish rescue increases juvenile survival to >90%, but captive rearing has also been shown to reduce subsequent adult survival; users can simulate across ranges of parameter values to evaluate the risks and benefits of applying fish rescue to their specific system. To narrow the parameter estimates for rescue effects and to directly evaluate an existing fish rescue program, we will empirically measure the survival of rescued and non-rescued coho salmon using mark-recapture techniques. Our modeling framework will help managers assess the biological trade-offs and economic feasibility of fish rescue under varying contexts of drought. We will disseminate our research through a webinar, workshop, and web-based user-parameterized model.

A suite of statistics, or metrics, was calculated, including correlation and variance of mean seasonal spatial patterns, amplitude of seasonal cycle, diurnal temperature range, annual- to decadal-scale variance, long-term persistence, and regional teleconnections to El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Performance, or credibility, was assessed based on the GCMs' abilities to reproduce the observed metrics. GCMs were ranked in their credibility using two methods. The first simply treated all metrics equally. The second method considered two properties of the metrics: (1) redundancy of information (dependence) among metrics, and (2) confidence in the reliability of an individual metric for accurately ranking models. Confidence was related to how robust the estimate of the metric was to ensemble size, given that for most of the models only a small number of ensemble members (i.e., realizations of the 20th century) were available. A cursory comparison with 24 CMIP3 models revealed few differences between the two generations of models with respect to the statistics analyzed.","parentId":"50463e10e4b0241d49d62c35","contacts":[{"name":"Rupp, David E.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Abatzoglou, John T.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Hegewisch, Katherine C.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Mote, Philip W.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jgrd.50843\/abstract","title":"Abstract Text Link","hidden":false},{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jgrd.50843\/full","title":"Full Text Link","hidden":false},{"type":"pdf","typeLabel":"PDF Download","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jgrd.50843\/pdf","title":"Publication PDF","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Climatology"},{"name":"Global climate models"},{"name":"CMIP5"},{"name":"Pacific Northwest"},{"name":"20th century"},{"name":"Empirical orthogonal function"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013-10-10","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-10-24T08:39:48.164-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-03-02T11:23:48.453-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1002\/jgrd.50843"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issn","value":"2169-8996"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Rupp, David E.","Abatzoglou, John T.","Hegewisch, Katherine C.","Mote, Philip W."],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"586c3ad2e4b0f5ce109fa895":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/531dcca7e4b04cb293ee787e","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Final Project Report - \"Climate Change Avian Vulnerability Visualization and Analysis Tool for Land Managers: Expansion to NW CSC with Dynamic Vegetation Simulations\"","relatedTitle":"Climate Change Avian Vulnerability Visualization and Analysis Tool for Land Managers: Expansion to NW CSC with Dynamic Vegetation Simulations","id":"586c3ad2e4b0f5ce109fa895","relatedId":"531dcca7e4b04cb293ee787e","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/586c3ad2e4b0f5ce109fa895","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Climate Change Avian Vulnerability Visualization and Analysis Tool for Land Managers: Expansion to NW CSC with Dynamic Vegetation Simulations","relatedTitle":"Final Project Report - \"Climate Change Avian Vulnerability Visualization and Analysis Tool for Land Managers: Expansion to NW CSC with Dynamic Vegetation Simulations\"","id":"531dcca7e4b04cb293ee787e","relatedId":"586c3ad2e4b0f5ce109fa895","annotation":null}]},"id":"586c3ad2e4b0f5ce109fa895","title":"Final Project Report - \"Climate Change Avian Vulnerability Visualization and Analysis Tool for Land Managers: Expansion to NW CSC with Dynamic Vegetation Simulations\"","body":"Ecological systems are already responding to modern changes in climate. Many species are moving in directions and at rates that correspond with recent climatic change. Understanding how species distributions and abundances are likely to be altered can inform management and planning activities resulting in more robust management. We projected climate-driven changes in the abundances and distributions of 31 focal bird species in Oregon and Washington using the latest downscaled CMIP5 climate projections and corresponding vegetation model outputs. We mapped these future projections and integrated them into an existing web-based tool (http:\/\/data.pointblue.org\/apps\/nwcsc\/) to allow managers and planners to access and download the projections. Our model outputs forecast significant changes in vegetation across much of Washington and Oregon by the end of the century. These changes are particularly dramatic east of the Cascade Mountains. Our bird models project much less dramatic changes in avian communities across the two states, but those changes tend to be largest in the Olympic and Cascade Mountains as well as across portions of the Columbia Plateau and in eastern and southeastern Oregon. Despite the smaller changes in avian communities, our models do project significant changes in abundance for some species in specific locations ranging from large increases to local extirpations. Our results also show that for some bird species, vegetation model projections are particularly important for forecasting changes in abundances and distributions. For example, Columbia Plateau Low Sagebrush Steppe and Shrubland, Northern Rocky Mountain-Vancouverian Montane-Foothill Grassland, and Great Basin and Intermountain (Sagebrush) Shrubland and Steppe were particularly important predictors for Oregon Vesper Sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus affinis). Dynamic general vegetation model (DGVM) outputs, such as fire, fuels, and carbon were important predictors of these habitat types. In conclusion our results forecast significant climate-driven changes in vegetation for the region and highlight areas where nuanced management actions will be warranted.","parentId":"531dcf00e4b04cb293ee7893","contacts":[{"name":"Joshua Lawler","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"birds"},{"name":"Cascade Mountains"}],"dates":[{"type":"Received ","dateString":"2016-07-11","label":"Date Received"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2017-01-03T16:59:14.500-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2017-01-03T17:02:59.158-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Final Report","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":6628190,"useForPreview":false,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"174880df24f48f045c826b870b49bd56"},"dateUploaded":"2017-01-03T23:59:09.000Z","name":"NWCSC_G14AP00175_UW_Lawler_FinalReport_16Nov16.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__32\/bc\/e8\/32bce834cf2b437d84013545629fc222b41bafa7","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/586c3ad2e4b0f5ce109fa895?f=__disk__32%2Fbc%2Fe8%2F32bce834cf2b437d84013545629fc222b41bafa7"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/586c3ad2e4b0f5ce109fa895","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalProjectRep.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Joshua Lawler"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"5447f05ce4b0f888a81b865e":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"5447f05ce4b0f888a81b865e","title":"Final Project Report - Sagebrush Ecosystems in a Changing Climate","body":"Climate responses of sagebrush are needed to inform land managers of the stability and restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, which are an important but threatened&nbsp;habitat type. We evaluated climate responses of sagebrush using two approaches: (1) experimental manipulations of temperature and precipitation for natural plants in the field, and (2)&nbsp;assessment of how climate adaptation and weather have affected sagebrush seeding efforts on nearly 25 large-scale sagebrush seeding projects done over the past several decades. Experimental warming increased growth of sagebrush in high-elevation meadows in the Teton Mountains, but had marginal or no effect&nbsp;at lower elevations sites (near Twin Falls and Boise, Idaho, respectively). Increased precipitation enhanced sagebrush abundance, along with&nbsp;flowering and stem growth, particularly&nbsp;when added in winter on deep soils. In the post-fire seeding study, we found sagebrush abundances to be highly variable across different seeding projects, and the variation was partly related to the climate of seeding and seed-source sites&nbsp;and weather. Sagebrush seeds typically traveled hundreds of kilometers and nearly&nbsp;1000 m downhill from seed source\/origins to seeding sites, from sites with colder minimum temperatures than the seeding sites. Big sagebrush is comprised of subspecies that differ in their climate adaptation, and many seeding projects received a subspecies that differed from the native type requested by&nbsp;the land managers. These climate transfers appeared important to the success of seedings: successful seedings imported seeds from sites having the same minimum temperatures. In failed &nbsp;seedings, seeds originated from relatively colder sites and, moreover, years with relatively warm minimum temperatures prevailed following planting. These results suggest minimum &nbsp;temperature and winter precipitation responses are important factors in the climate adaptation and ecology of this desert shrub, and their consideration in climate vulnerability analyses and selection of seed sources is likely to improve land planning and restoration.&nbsp;","parentId":"504665d5e4b0241d49d62cc1","contacts":[{"name":"Matthew J Germino","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Keith Reinhardt","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Idaho State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"David Pilliod","oldPartyId":8129,"type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"dpilliod@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Supervisory Research Ecologist","firstName":"David","lastName":"Pilliod","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"2084265202","streetAddress":{"zip":"83706","city":"Boise","state":"ID","line1":"970 Lusk Street"},"buildingCode":"WID","name":"David Pilliod\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"83706","country":"USA","city":"Boise","state":"ID","line1":"970 Lusk Street"},"building":"SNAKE RIVER FIELD STATION"}},{"name":"Diane Debinski","oldPartyId":65979,"type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"debinski@iastate.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Diane","lastName":"Debinski","organization":{"displayText":"Iowa State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Ann Marie Raymondi","oldPartyId":19839,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"araymondi@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Biological Science Technician","firstName":"Ann Marie","lastName":"Raymondi","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"2084265207","streetAddress":{"zip":"83706","country":"US","city":"Boise","state":"ID","line1":"970 Lusk Street"},"buildingCode":"WID","name":"Ann Marie Raymondi\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"97331","country":"USA","city":"Corvallis","state":"OR","line1":"3200 S.W.

However, climate change is now proceeding so quickly that it is becoming difficult for species to move fast enough to keep pace. In addition, today\u2019s landscapes feature significant barriers to movement presented by human land uses (e.g., roads, cities, farms). Such is the case in the region around the border of Washington and British Columbia, where increasing development pressure and limited coordination of land and wildlife management across the border pose a threat to the future ability of wildlife to move as the climate changes. The Washington-British Columbia Transboundary Climate-Connectivity Project sought to address this problem by building the capacity of land and wildlife managers in the transboundary region to incorporate climate change and wildlife movement into their decision-making. The project paired climate scientists with land and wildlife managers from both sides of the border to work together to anticipate how climate change may impact wildlife movement and identify actions for addressing these impacts, so that their management of the landscape and the wildlife within it would be better prepared for future change. Products of this effort are freely available via an online tool that allows users to view and download reports, maps, and other project products describing potential climate impacts and management responses for a diverse group of plants and animals living in the transboundary region. Together, this effort and its products have enhanced the ability of land and wildlife managers in Washington and British Columbia to collaboratively respond to future threats to regional wildlife movement, enhancing the resilience of our shared species and ecosystems.<\/div>\n","parentId":"5318c6bae4b0ae6e9d5a3bb1","contacts":[{"name":"Meade Krosby","oldPartyId":24506,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"mkrosby@u.washington.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Meade","lastName":"Krosby","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington","directoryId":"64464"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Document","Downloadable","Report","Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Connectivity"},{"type":"Subject","name":" climate change"},{"type":"Subject","name":" distribution"}],"dates":[{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2016-04-30","label":"Date Reported"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-08-16T18:53:08.586-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-12-13T10:37:59.709-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Final Report","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":1224875,"useForPreview":false,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"b6bcc8970faabe1a663c52747ebffbdf"},"dateUploaded":"2016-08-17T00:53:07.000Z","name":"NWCSC_G14AP00096_UW_Krosby_FinalReport.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__8d\/da\/e7\/8ddae71d2d649af7732ecaae2883ef8c2c6ef3ae","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/57b3b574e4b03bcb010397fb?f=__disk__8d%2Fda%2Fe7%2F8ddae71d2d649af7732ecaae2883ef8c2c6ef3ae"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/57b3b574e4b03bcb010397fb","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalProjectRep.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Meade Krosby"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"5806a7abe4b0841e59e282ae":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/55e01730e4b0f42e3d040dce","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Final Project Report: Integrated Scenarios Tools: Improving Accessibility of the Integrated Scenarios Data","relatedTitle":"Integrated Scenarios Tools: Improving the Accessibility of the Integrated Scenarios Data","id":"5806a7abe4b0841e59e282ae","relatedId":"55e01730e4b0f42e3d040dce","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5806a7abe4b0841e59e282ae","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Integrated Scenarios Tools: Improving the Accessibility of the Integrated Scenarios Data","relatedTitle":"Final Project Report: Integrated Scenarios Tools: Improving Accessibility of the Integrated Scenarios Data","id":"55e01730e4b0f42e3d040dce","relatedId":"5806a7abe4b0841e59e282ae","annotation":null}]},"id":"5806a7abe4b0841e59e282ae","title":"Final Project Report: Integrated Scenarios Tools: Improving Accessibility of the Integrated Scenarios Data","body":"The Integrated Scenarios (IS) of the Future Northwest Environment project resulted in several datasets describing projected changes in climate, hydrology and vegetation for the 21st century over the Northwestern US.

The intimate connections that tribes have maintained with the natural environment are more spiritually rich and complex than non-Native consumptive views of natural resources. After careful consideration of tribe size, level of cultural activity, strength of ties to the environment, and connection to culturally significant and aboriginal geographic regions, three Northwest tribes were selected for this study--the&nbsp;Confederated Tribes of Salish and Kootenai, the Qinault Indian Nation, and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians. Information was collected through interviews with tribal elders and individuals with substantial cultural expertise. We found that in addition to changes in specific cultural practices, a profound disruption to identity connected with (a) changes in seasonality, disturbing the sense of natural time; and (b) a sense that wisdom passed down through generations is no longer a sound basis for which decisions are made. These observations contribute to the understanding of Northwest tribal culture and its vulnerability and adaptive capacity to a changing climate. This research documented traditional cultural commonalities among the tribes involved with this project and illustrated inter-tribal cultural adaptations to their prevailing environmental conditions. The results of this study will also provide tribes a resource to assess climate change impacts on their cultural practices and identity.&nbsp;","parentId":"52fa3070e4b02baefb0492b7","contacts":[{"name":"Philip W Mote","oldPartyId":55752,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.","firstName":"Philip","middleName":"W","lastName":"Mote","organization":{"displayText":"Oregon State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Tribal"},{"name":"adaptive capacity"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015-02-04","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-01-29T13:04:35.164-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-02-26T08:18:58.017-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Final Report","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":1543605,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-01-29T20:08:15.000Z","name":"NWCSC_G13AC00264_OSU_Mote_FinalReport_03Feb15.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__ff\/2c\/04\/ff2c041d689a3473937aeec16ac2526fe7aee097","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/56abc5d3e4b0403299f4649c?f=__disk__ff%2F2c%2F04%2Fff2c041d689a3473937aeec16ac2526fe7aee097"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/56abc5d3e4b0403299f4649c","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalReportfor_.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Philip W Mote"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"566edcbbe4b09cfe53ca76b5":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5006e94ee4b0abf7ce733f56","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Final Report for \"Climate Change and Peak Flows\" Project","relatedTitle":"Climate Change and Peak Flows: Knowledge-to-Action to Help Managers Address Impacts on Streamflow Dynamics and Aquatic Habitat","id":"566edcbbe4b09cfe53ca76b5","relatedId":"5006e94ee4b0abf7ce733f56","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/566edcbbe4b09cfe53ca76b5","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Climate Change and Peak Flows: Knowledge-to-Action to Help Managers Address Impacts on Streamflow Dynamics and Aquatic Habitat","relatedTitle":"Final Report for \"Climate Change and Peak Flows\" Project","id":"5006e94ee4b0abf7ce733f56","relatedId":"566edcbbe4b09cfe53ca76b5","annotation":null}]},"id":"566edcbbe4b09cfe53ca76b5","title":"Final Report for \"Climate Change and Peak Flows\" Project","body":"What will the rivers of the Pacific Northwest look like in the future? Will they be stable or unstable? Will the waters be cold and clear or warm and muddy? Will they have salmon or other species? These questions motivated our two-year study of climate warming effects on headwater streams draining the Cascade Mountains. Using a novel combination of snow, geohydrology, and sediment transport models we assessed the vulnerability of stream channels to changing peak streamflow. Our snow modeling shows that with just a 2\u00b0C warming, snowfall shifts to rainfall at all elevations, peak snowpacks occur over two months earlier, and snowpacks are reduced by over half of historical values. Our geohydrology modeling shows that greater rainfall and earlier snowmelt enhances peak winter streamflows but impacts depend on snow amount and watershed geohydrology. In spring-fed watersheds, increased winter flows are within historical bounds. In runoff-dominated watersheds, increased winter flows will exceed the historical range by up to 44% and the frequency of high flows will increase by over 100 days per year. Since streambed gravels and sand are transported during high flows, climate warming is likely to result in a dramatic increase in the amount of sediment moving through Cascade streams. Daily sediment transport rates in the surface-runoff system could potentially double. Besides affecting water quality with increased levels of suspended sediment, more frequent sediment transport events may lead to instability in the gravels where bull trout and salmon lay their eggs, making their survival less certain in the future. A key aspect of this project was engaging managers through a knowledge- to-action approach. Stakeholder dialogues were held in organized workshops and informal discussions through which we shared needs, information, and knowledge to interpret the consequences of these projected changes for water supply, threatened and endangered aquatic species, and dam operations.&nbsp;","parentId":"5046442fe4b0241d49d62c4a","contacts":[{"name":"Anne Nolin","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Oregon State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"tags":[{"name":"Headwater Streams"},{"name":"Water"},{"name":"Future"},{"name":"Snow"},{"name":"Sediment Transport"}],"dates":[{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2015-02-23","label":"Date Reported"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-12-14T08:14:03.138-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-03-01T10:07:08.637-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":10219262,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-12-14T15:13:41.000Z","name":"NWCSC_G12AC20452_OSU_Nolin_FinalReport_02March15.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__64\/93\/65\/649365afcff3bc8ad9f5ccb2b72609083526eaae","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/566edcbbe4b09cfe53ca76b5?f=__disk__64%2F93%2F65%2F649365afcff3bc8ad9f5ccb2b72609083526eaae"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/566edcbbe4b09cfe53ca76b5","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalReportfor_.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Anne Nolin"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"55689a10e4b0d9246a9f623d":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5006e8e4e4b0abf7ce733f54","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Final Report for \"Climate-Change Vulnerability in the Pacific Northwest: A Comparison of Three Approaches\"","relatedTitle":"Climate-Change Vulnerability in the Pacific Northwest: A Comparison of Three Approaches","id":"55689a10e4b0d9246a9f623d","relatedId":"5006e8e4e4b0abf7ce733f54","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/55689a10e4b0d9246a9f623d","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Climate-Change Vulnerability in the Pacific Northwest: A Comparison of Three Approaches","relatedTitle":"Final Report for \"Climate-Change Vulnerability in the Pacific Northwest: A Comparison of Three Approaches\"","id":"5006e8e4e4b0abf7ce733f54","relatedId":"55689a10e4b0d9246a9f623d","annotation":null}]},"id":"55689a10e4b0d9246a9f623d","title":"Final Report for \"Climate-Change Vulnerability in the Pacific Northwest: A Comparison of Three Approaches\"","body":"Climate change is already affecting species in many ways. Because individual species respond to climate change differently, some will be adversely affected by climate change whereas others may benefit. Successfully managing species in a changing climate will require an understanding of which species will be most and least impacted by climate change. Although several approaches have been proposed for assessing the vulnerability of species to climate change, it is unclear whether these approaches are likely to produce similar results. In this study, we compared the relative vulnerabilities to climate change of 76 species of birds, mammals, amphibians, and trees based on three different approaches to assessing vulnerability. We compared (1) projected shifts in species distributions to (2) an assessment based on expert opinion and projected changes in climate to (3) an approach based on the current and future climatic conditions within species\u2019 current ranges. We found that the three approaches provided substantially different rankings of the species. Some species were determined to be highly vulnerable by one approach but only moderately vulnerable by the other two approaches. Only one species, the caribou, was consistently ranked in the top ten most vulnerable species by all three approaches. This is not entirely surprising given that the three measures assess different aspects of vulnerability and are based on different types of information. Nonetheless, these results are important because they indicate that more than one approach may be needed to adequately assess vulnerability\u2014and that basing management decisions on one approach alone may lead scientists and managers to underestimate vulnerability.&nbsp;&nbsp;","parentId":"5046659ee4b0241d49d62cb2","contacts":[{"name":"Joshua J.

Wetlands challenge our current scientific capacity because of their sheer number, their wide range of sizes, and their dynamic nature. As a result, wetlands are understudied compared to other ecosystem types. However, wetlands are thought to be among the most sensitive ecosystems to climate change, so the lack of dedicated scientific resources has accelerating consequences going forward. Our goal in this project was to address the deficiency in wetland resources by developing new approaches and technical tools to better understand wetlands in general and to more effectively manage and conserve wetlands under a changing climate. By focusing our efforts on a range of wetland types, our goal was to better characterize landscape-scale climate change impacts to wetlands across the Pacific Northwest region in support of ongoing assessment and adaptation efforts. Our approach was designed in collaboration with natural resource managers, and involved three methodological advances. First, using remote sensing approaches, we developed new methods for mapping wetlands and reconstructing historical wetland hydrologic dynamics. Second, we used the Variable Infiltration Capacity model, a regional-scale hydrologic model, to hindcast historical wetland dynamics and project the future impacts of climate change on wetlands. Third, we linked these approaches with ecological data to evaluate the impacts and risk of climate change to several classes of wetlands across three ecoregions of Washington state. In the process we developed or collected multiple new datasets on wetland distributions, dynamics, and species occupancy. This work has broad societal value in deepening our understanding of wetland dynamics over time; creating new tools that enable better management and conservation of wetlands and the ecological services that they provide; and enriching conservation and climate adaptation planning efforts with resource and evidence-based decision power.&nbsp;&nbsp;","parentId":"504650bde4b0241d49d62c6d","contacts":[{"name":"joshua lawler","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"tags":[{"name":"wetlands"},{"name":"amphibians"}],"dates":[{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2014-12-20","label":"Date Reported"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-06-11T12:25:09.701-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-03-01T09:26:58.969-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":43843036,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-06-11T18:24:27.000Z","name":"NWCSC_G12AC20482_UW_Lawler_FinalReport.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__54\/f1\/91\/54f191de4ba1da2bddaff4192feda0dffec6cd16","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5579d285e4b032353cc175c3?f=__disk__54%2Ff1%2F91%2F54f191de4ba1da2bddaff4192feda0dffec6cd16"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5579d285e4b032353cc175c3","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalReportfor_.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["joshua lawler"]},"55db7caae4b0518e35470be5":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5006eb9de4b0abf7ce733f5c","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Final Report for \"Integrated Scenarios of Climate, Hydrology, and Vegetation for the Northwest\"","relatedTitle":"Integrated Scenarios of Climate, Hydrology, and Vegetation for the Northwest (Funded Jointly by the Northwest CSC and NOAA\u2019s Climate Impacts Research Consortium)","id":"55db7caae4b0518e35470be5","relatedId":"5006eb9de4b0abf7ce733f5c","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/55db7caae4b0518e35470be5","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Integrated Scenarios of Climate, Hydrology, and Vegetation for the Northwest (Funded Jointly by the Northwest CSC and NOAA\u2019s Climate Impacts Research Consortium)","relatedTitle":"Final Report for \"Integrated Scenarios of Climate, Hydrology, and Vegetation for the Northwest\"","id":"5006eb9de4b0abf7ce733f5c","relatedId":"55db7caae4b0518e35470be5","annotation":null}]},"id":"55db7caae4b0518e35470be5","title":"Final Report for \"Integrated Scenarios of Climate, Hydrology, and Vegetation for the Northwest\"","body":"Climate change is expected to have different effects in different parts of the world.

The goal of this project was to use the latest global climate models and state of the science models of vegetation and hydrology, to describe what the latest science says about the Northwest\u2019s future climate, vegetation, and hydrology. Researchers in the project began by evaluating the ability of climate models to simulate observed climate patterns in the Northwest region. The best performing models were \u2018downscaled\u2019, that is, remapped onto the finer grids used in models of hydrology and vegetation. The researchers used the best performing models to project likely future changes to the Northwest\u2019s climate, hydrology, and vegetation.&nbsp;One product of this work is a series of freely available datasets that can be used to address specific management questions. These datasets are compatible with other hydrological and ecological modeling efforts and represent a next-generation climate change framework for land managers. This framework supports a range of management activities to increase the resilience of Northwest ecosystems, agricultural systems, and built environments. It allows the development of tools to help land managers identify the most vulnerable areas in the region and to develop strategies for reducing the impacts of climate change.\n<br> \n<br> This project was funded jointly by the Department of the Interior\u2019s Northwest Climate Science Center&nbsp;and by the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration\u2019s Climate Impacts Research Consortium.

A formal Memorandum of Understanding was developed between Oregon State University&nbsp;and the PGST to guide this culturally sensitive research. We recommend this formal approach to researchers considering tribal partnerships in order to ensure expectations of all parties are clearly outlined. During formal interviews and informal conversation, PGST elders mentioned 37 plants, of which eight terrestrial species and a group of marine taxa were of particular concern due to limited availabilities in 26 traditional gathering locations within the Usual and Accustomed (U&amp;A) gathering area guaranteed by the 1855 Point No Point Treaty. Landsat data were used to analyze recent changes in land cover within the U&amp;A. Substantial changes in land cover were found between 1975 and 2010. Detailed analysis for 1990-2010 documented recent forest fragmentation, loss of freshwater wetlands, and both losses and gains of saltwater wetlands. Current regional distribution and autecological information for the eight focal terrestrial species were compiled using available databases, herbarium records, and literature. Field studies documented plant communities in which selected focal species are currently found.<\/p> \n<p>Downscaled results from existing Pacific Northwest&nbsp;climate scenarios were adapted to the Olympic and Kitsap Peninsula, which house the U&amp;A. These suggest somewhat hotter, drier summers and somewhat warmer, wetter conditions in other seasons by the late 21st century. Likely changes in seasonal precipitation were less clear, with uncertainty regarding&nbsp;the magnitude and even direction of change. Published information related to climate variables for the eight focal species was sparse, making even semi-quantitative projections of response to changing climates impossible. In addition, we created map of the U&amp;A shoreline representing expected changes in shoreline due to changing climates combined with tectonic events. In summary, this project established a baseline on which future studies of vulnerable traditional women\u2019s plants can be built.<\/p>","parentId":"526eaa50e4b044919baee8d9","contacts":[{"name":"Jesse Ford","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Oregon State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"traditional foods"},{"name":"tribal"},{"name":"climate scenarios"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015-06-29","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-01-29T12:37:35.296-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-02-26T08:59:53.905-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Final Report","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":5555036,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-01-29T19:41:06.000Z","name":"NWCSC_G13AC00391_OSU_Ford_FinalReport.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__15\/3c\/9c\/153c9c9a6b4a9c2366f72d5599cdaa2a5adfeee6","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/56abbf7fe4b0403299f46442?f=__disk__15%2F3c%2F9c%2F153c9c9a6b4a9c2366f72d5599cdaa2a5adfeee6"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/56abbf7fe4b0403299f46442","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalReportfor_.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Jesse Ford"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"54dfc47ce4b08de9379b3a78":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5006f464e4b0abf7ce733f90","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Final Report for Range-Wide Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Threatened Bull Trout","relatedTitle":"Rangewide Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Threatened Bull Trout","id":"54dfc47ce4b08de9379b3a78","relatedId":"5006f464e4b0abf7ce733f90","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/54dfc47ce4b08de9379b3a78","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Rangewide Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Threatened Bull Trout","relatedTitle":"Final Report for Range-Wide Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Threatened Bull Trout","id":"5006f464e4b0abf7ce733f90","relatedId":"54dfc47ce4b08de9379b3a78","annotation":null}]},"id":"54dfc47ce4b08de9379b3a78","title":"Final Report for Range-Wide Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Threatened Bull Trout","body":"Bull Trout is the most cold-adapted fish in freshwaters of the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp;

Future work will focus on completing these analyses across the range of Bull Trout in the conterminous United States.","parentId":"502a9e8fe4b0a8e4a0fdb164","contacts":[{"name":"Jason Dunham","oldPartyId":2751,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"jdunham@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Supervisory Research Aquatic Ecologist","firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Dunham","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"5417500990","streetAddress":{"zip":"97331","city":"Corvallis","state":"OR","line1":"3200 SW JEFFERSON WAY"},"buildingCode":"WOB","name":"Jason Dunham\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"97331","country":"USA","city":"Corvallis","state":"OR","line1":"3200 S.W.

The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However, at most sites mid sea-level rise projections led to the loss of middle and high marsh and a gain in low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.&nbsp;","parentId":"50464669e4b0241d49d62c61","contacts":[{"name":"Karen M Thorne","oldPartyId":13502,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"kthorne@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Ecologist (Landscape)","firstName":"Karen","middleName":"M","lastName":"Thorne","organization":{"displayText":"Western Ecological Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"7075622005","officePhone":"7075623003","streetAddress":{"zip":"94592","city":"Vallejo","state":"CA","line1":"505 Azuar Drive"},"buildingCode":"WBW","name":"Karen M Thorne\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

However, if forests can be managed to retain snow longer, some of these environmental and financial impacts may be mitigated. Recent results from our research team demonstrate that in areas with relatively warm winters, strategically-cut forest gaps could offset climatic warming by increasing snow retention on the landscape and delaying runoff. However, in areas with colder winters, the opposite is true, as snow lasts longer under the forest canopy. We will map these climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect snow duration in different locations and testing those predictions against careful observations from our field sites and a network of citizen scientists. Working with regional forest and water managers, we will identify strategies for applying these findings to decision-making, linking climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management. Results from this project will help managers to act strategically to maximize snow retention (protecting forests in some areas while opening gaps in others), providing more water later in the season for hydropower, agriculture, and fish flows.","parentId":"531899cce4b051b1b924ea01","contacts":[{"name":"Jessica Lundquist","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"jdlund@u.washington.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"206-685-7594","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"98195-2700","country":"USA","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","line1":"Civil and Environmental Engineering\r\nUniversity of Washington\r\nBox 352700"}}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jim Lutz","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Susan Dickerson-Lange","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Anne Nolin","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Oregon State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Timothy Link","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Idaho"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Amy Snover","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Rolf Gersonde","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Cedar River Municipal Watershed"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Steve Malloch","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"National Wildlife Federation"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Label","name":"forest"},{"type":"Label","name":"snow"},{"type":"Label","name":"management"},{"type":"Label","name":"watershed analysis"},{"type":"Label","name":"snow retention"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Location","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Location","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Northwest CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-08-25","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2016-08-24","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-03-11T14:32:21.367-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-27T02:42:16.613-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Grant Award Number","value":"G14AP00174"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":192999.77,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2014","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":93635.21},{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":99364.56}]},{"facetName":"Expando","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ExpandoFacet"}],"files":[{"imageWidth":1280,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":943144,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2016-03-17T21:03:46.000Z","name":"NW-2014-6_HiddenLake_NorthCascadeNP_RichardSheibleyIII_USGS.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__f0\/ed\/24\/f0ed24250345ef029b05fe36c0e7222a879ee2d1","title":"Hidden Lake, North Cascade National Park -

Nevertheless, few studies have measured how climatic variation influences genetic diversity within populations or how genetic diversity is distributed across space relative to future climatic stress. Here, we tested whether patterns of genetic diversity (allelic richness) were related to climatic variation and habitat features in 130 bull trout ( \n<em>Salvelinus confluentus<\/em>) populations from 24 watersheds (i.e., ~4\u20137th order river subbasins) across the Columbia River Basin, USA. We then determined whether bull trout genetic diversity was related to climate vulnerability at the watershed scale, which we quantified on the basis of exposure to future climatic conditions (projected scenarios for the 2040s) and existing habitat complexity. We found a strong gradient in genetic diversity in bull trout populations across the Columbia River Basin, where populations located in the most upstream headwater areas had the greatest genetic diversity. After accounting for spatial patterns with linear mixed models, allelic richness in bull trout populations was positively related to habitat patch size and complexity, and negatively related to maximum summer temperature and the frequency of winter flooding. These relationships strongly suggest that climatic variation influences evolutionary processes in this threatened species and that genetic diversity will likely decrease due to future climate change. Vulnerability at a watershed scale was negatively correlated with average genetic diversity ( \n<em>r&nbsp;<\/em>= \n<em>&nbsp;<\/em>\u22120.77;&nbsp; \n<em>P&nbsp;<\/em>&lt; \n<em>&nbsp;<\/em>0.001); watersheds containing populations with lower average genetic diversity generally had the lowest habitat complexity, warmest stream temperatures, and greatest frequency of winter flooding. Together, these findings have important conservation implications for bull trout and other imperiled species. Genetic diversity is already depressed where climatic vulnerability is highest; it will likely erode further in the very places where diversity may be most needed for future persistence.","parentId":"50465251e4b0241d49d62c7c","contacts":[{"name":"Kovach, Ryan P.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Muhlfeld, Clint C.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Wade, Alisa A.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Hand, Brian K.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Whited, Diane C.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"DeHaan, Patrick W.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Al\u2010Chokhachy, Robert","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Luikart, Gordon","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gcb.12850\/abstract","title":"Kovach et al. 2015","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"bull trout"},{"name":"climate change"},{"name":"conservation genetics"},{"name":"genetic diversity"},{"name":"salmonid"},{"name":"stream flow"},{"name":"temperature"},{"name":"vulnerability"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015-07","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-02-09T17:12:09.969-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-07-10T08:07:16.219-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Global Change Biology","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1111\/gcb.12850"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issn","value":"1365-2486"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Kovach, Ryan P.","Muhlfeld, Clint C.","Wade, Alisa A.","Hand, Brian K.","Whited, Diane C.","DeHaan, Patrick W.","Al\u2010Chokhachy, Robert","Luikart, Gordon"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"54dd2a7ce4b08de9379b309e":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5006e81ae4b0abf7ce733f52","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Genomics and introgression: discovery and mapping of thousands of species-diagnostic SNPs using RAD sequencing","relatedTitle":"Predicting Climate Change Impacts on River Ecosystems and Salmonids across the Pacific Northwest: Combining Vulnerability Modeling, Landscape Genomics, and Economic Evaluations for Conservation","id":"54dd2a7ce4b08de9379b309e","relatedId":"5006e81ae4b0abf7ce733f52","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/54dd2a7ce4b08de9379b309e","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Predicting Climate Change Impacts on River Ecosystems and Salmonids across the Pacific Northwest: Combining Vulnerability Modeling, Landscape Genomics, and Economic Evaluations for Conservation","relatedTitle":"Genomics and introgression: discovery and mapping of thousands of species-diagnostic SNPs using RAD sequencing","id":"5006e81ae4b0abf7ce733f52","relatedId":"54dd2a7ce4b08de9379b309e","annotation":null}]},"id":"54dd2a7ce4b08de9379b309e","title":"Genomics and introgression: discovery and mapping of thousands of species-diagnostic SNPs using RAD sequencing","body":"<p>Invasive hybridization and introgression pose a serious threat to the persistence of many native species. Understanding the effects of hybridization on native populations (e.g., fitness consequences) requires numerous species-diagnostic loci distributed genome-wide. Here we used RAD sequencing to discover thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are diagnostic between rainbow trout (RBT, Oncorhynchus mykiss), the world\u2019s most widely introduced fish, and native westslope cutthroat trout (WCT, O. clarkii lewisi) in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. We advanced previous work that identified 4,914 species-diagnostic loci by using longer sequence reads (100 bp vs. 60 bp) and a larger set of individuals (n = 84). We sequenced RAD libraries for individuals from diverse sampling sources, including native populations of WCT and hatchery broodstocks of WCT and RBT. We also took advantage of a newly released reference genome assembly for RBT to align our RAD loci. In total, we discovered 16,788 putatively diagnostic SNPs, 10,267 of which we mapped to anchored chromosome locations on the RBT genome. A small portion of previously discovered putative diagnostic loci (325 of 4,914) were no longer diagnostic (i.e., fixed between species) based on our wider survey of non-hybridized RBT and WCT individuals. Our study suggests that RAD loci mapped to a draft genome assembly could provide the marker density required to identify genes and chromosomal regions influencing selection in admixed populations of conservation concern and evolutionary interest.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50465251e4b0241d49d62c7c"],"contacts":[{"name":"Brian K Hand","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Tyler D Hether","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Ryan P.

Beyond improving theoretical understanding of glacier-influenced hydrology and building operational tools for other scientists, this project helps citizens of AK and WA by providing improved historical and projected statistics of streamflow to land resource managers and private citizens alike. This will be done by sharing the software and raw data of the modeling process through internet-standard protocols and developing a web portal specifically designed to allow users to explore content, access data, and view results through map-based and statistical visualizations. This will help the general population understand (1) the state of available resources, (2) potential responses of hydrology to changes in climate and glacier extent, and (3) uncertainty of model simulations associated with use of historical and projected future climate data. The development of this information can support the assessment of potential hazards (such as ice dam failures) and decision-making for more resilient development and risk management. &nbsp; <\/div>","parentId":"55130c4fe4b02e76d75c0755","linkParentIds":["4ffae449e4b0c15d5ce9fadf","55130bb3e4b02e76d75c0748"],"contacts":[{"name":"Roland Viger","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"rviger@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Geographer","firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Viger","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Branch of Regional Research, Central Region"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"3032365034","officePhone":"3035413075","streetAddress":{"zip":"80309","city":"Boulder","state":"CO","line1":"3215 Marine St, Bldg 6"},"buildingCode":"KDG","name":"Roland Viger\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80303","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"412","city":"Boulder","state":"CO","line1":"3215 Marine Street, Suite E-127, Mail Stop 412"},"building":"University of Colorado - Building 6"}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alaska CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Lauren E Hay","oldPartyId":4344,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"lhay@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Hydrologist","firstName":"Lauren","middleName":"E","lastName":"Hay","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Branch of Regional Research, Central Region"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"3032365034","officePhone":"3032367279","streetAddress":{"zip":"80225","city":"Lakewood","state":"CO","line1":"W 6th Ave Kipling St"},"buildingCode":"KAH","name":"Lauren E Hay\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80225-0046","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"412","city":"Denver","state":"CO","line1":"Box 25046, Denver Federal Center, Mail Stop 412"},"building":"DFC Bldg 53"}},{"name":"Steven L Markstrom","oldPartyId":6505,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"markstro@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Hydrologist","firstName":"Steven","middleName":"L","lastName":"Markstrom","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Branch of Regional Research, Central Region"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"3032365034","officePhone":"3032363330","streetAddress":{"zip":"80225","city":"Lakewood","state":"CO","line1":"W 6th Ave Kipling St"},"buildingCode":"KAH","name":"Steven L Markstrom\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80225-0046","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"412","city":"Denver","state":"CO","line1":"Box 25046, Denver Federal Center, Mail Stop 412"},"building":"DFC Bldg 53"}},{"name":"Robert Steven Regan","oldPartyId":40010,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from FPPS data from 1992 through 2009.","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"Steven","lastName":"Regan","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Branch of Regional Research, Central Region"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Gregory J McCabe","oldPartyId":6652,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"gmccabe@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Physical Scientist","firstName":"Gregory","middleName":"J","lastName":"McCabe","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Branch of Regional Research, Central Region"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"3032365034","officePhone":"3032367278","streetAddress":{"zip":"80225","city":"Lakewood","state":"CO","line1":"W 6th Ave Kipling St"},"buildingCode":"KAH","name":"Gregory J Mccabe\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80225-0046","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"413","city":"Denver","state":"CO","line1":"Box 25046, Denver Federal Center, Mail Stop 413"},"building":"DFC Bldg 53"}},{"name":"Jacob H LaFontaine","oldPartyId":5799,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"jlafonta@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Hydrologist","personalTitle":"Mr.","firstName":"Jacob","middleName":"H","lastName":"LaFontaine","cellPhone":"6786182644","organization":{"displayText":"Georgia Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"6789246710","officePhone":"6789246664","streetAddress":{"zip":"30093","city":"Norcross","state":"GA","line1":"1770 Corporate Drive Suite 500"},"buildingCode":"AYE","name":"Jacob H LaFontaine\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"30360-2824","country":"USA","city":"Atlanta","state":"GA","line1":"3039 Amwiler Road, Suite 130"},"building":"GA WSC & SE Rex Offices"}},{"name":"Ashley E.

In support of the Pacific Northwest Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment (www.climatevulnerability.org), we developed a method to model habitat suitability in which we built correlative climate suitability models for 366 terrestrial animal species at a relatively coarse spatial resolution for the entire North American continent, using species range maps and 23 bioclimatic variables. We then applied the models to both current and projected future climate data downscaled to a moderately fine resolution for western North America. We refined the resulting climate suitability projections by applying a filter that limited suitability to areas in which suitable biomes were projected to be present. This map is part of a collection of projected current and future potential distributions of 366 terrestrial vertebrate species, including 12 amphibians, 237 birds, and 117 mammals, based on correlative bioclimatic models and projected changes in biomes.","purpose":"Understanding which plant and animal species will be most susceptible to future climate change is crucial for managing natural resources and public lands. The objective of this project is to compare the results of three of the different approaches that have been developed to assess the vulnerability of selected plants and animals using different future climate scenarios. This comparison includes approaches that (1) integrate expert-opinion-based assessments of climate sensitivities with projected changes in climate, (2) use numerical model projections to forecast potential climate-driven shifts in species distributions, and (3) combine measures of current climate and projected climatic changes.","parentId":"5046659ae4b0241d49d62cb0","contacts":[{"name":"Josh

Warming Climate?","body":"<p>Forests strongly influence snow processes and affect the amount and duration of snow storage on a landscape. Therefore, forest changes, from management activities or natural disturbances, have important consequences for spring and summer soil moisture availability, aquatic habitat, and water supply. Accounting for these effects of forest change on watersheds will become even more important under warming climate conditions, which will reduce the amount and duration of snow storage.<\/p> \n<p>In this webinar, Susan E. Dickerson-Lange presents on Northwest Climate Science Center supported research that led to the creation of a conceptual model that paired relevant spatial datasets for considering the combined impacts of forest and climate change across the Pacific Northwest, USA. Predicting the effects of forest on snow storage depends on drivers that vary across locations, such as winter temperature, wind speed, cloudiness, and solar radiation. The net result is that management actions, such as timber harvesting, can have unintended effects on snow storage and duration depending on location.

Many federal, state and local agencies use stream insects to monitor the health of freshwater ecosystems. While the temperature ranges for some insects are often inferred from the temperature of the waters where they were collected, this inference is coarse at best and problematic at worst. Stream temperatures fluctuate a lot during the year and temperature may or may not control where an insect lives. Field insects were collected and sent to a laboratory for testing several temperature endpoints, particularly at higher temperatures. Respiration, breathing rate, and some physical activities were expected to increase, as the insects attempt to deal with elevated temperatures and expected oxygen limitations. Previous research found that oxygen limitation results in the build-up of lactic and uric acids in tissues of insects, but this was not observed over the range of temperatures and types of insects tested for this study. While respiration, breathing rate and, physical behavior such as pumping motions were observed, it did not appear that elevated temperature alone was resulting in oxygen limitation. This was further confirmed with more experiments that looked specifically at low oxygen waters at various temperatures and included an evaluation of the insect\u2019s metabolic waste products; these warm temperature challenges did not suggest an oxygen deficit in these insects. Rather,&nbsp;the experiments suggested a more general elevated metabolic demand where the insects had to work harder to breath, eat, and molt. Further work to try and identify specific macroinvertebrate temperature tolerance values could be used by scientists and resource managers to predict aquatic resources at greatest risk to temperature change.<\/p>","parentId":"5006c1e5e4b0abf7ce733f3b","contacts":[{"name":"Robert W Black","oldPartyId":866,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"rwblack@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Chief Supervisory Hydrologist","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"W","lastName":"Black","organization":{"displayText":"Washington Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"2535521581","streetAddress":{"zip":"98402","country":"US","city":"Tacoma","state":"WA","line1":"934 Broadway, Suite 300"},"buildingCode":"WWT","name":"Robert W Black\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"98402","country":"USA","city":"Tacoma","state":"WA","line1":"934 Broadway, Suite 300"}}},{"name":"Susan B.

At higher elevations, headwater streams fared no better, with numerous streams experiencing periods of \u201cno flow\u201d for the first time in recorded history. During the winter of 2014\/2015 higher than average temperatures caused a transition in precipitation from snow to rain. This change in precipitation phase reduced the overall snowpack below annual means as well as caused increased runoff during late winter and early spring. Moreover, with higher temperatures the snowmelt season started earlier than normal reducing the amount of late season snowmelt available to headwater streams. The objective of this proposal is to identify key headwater streams that are the most resilient to drought as they will naturally be the streams that can best sustain threatened aquatic and terrestrial populations during future droughts. Stream permanence models incorporating remotely sensed data and basin geographical characteristics will be used to determine and predict these critical watersheds for focused management and restoration of critical aquatic species such as bull trout, redband cutthroat trout, and Lahontan cutthroat trout. Calibration of historical stream permanence models and hydrology-based ecosystem models in headwater streams are often limited in prediction capability as streamflow measurements are typically absent. This proposal includes the design of simple low-cost citizen science methods to enable a sizeable increase in the number and location of our nation\u2019s headwater streamflow estimates. The techniques will be evaluated for their accuracy and field-tested with multiple environmental organizations.","parentId":"57daef3fe4b090824ffc3226","contacts":[{"name":"Kyle Blasch","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"kblasch@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Idaho Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"2083871321","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"83702","country":"USA","city":"Boise","state":"ID","line1":"230 Collins Road"}}},{"name":"Thomas Sando","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"tsando@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Montana Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"4064575953","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"59601-6456","country":"USA","city":"Helena","state":"MT","line1":"3162 Bozeman Ave"}}},{"name":"Jason Dunham","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jdunham@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Corvallis Research Group, FRESC"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"5417500990","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"97331","country":"USA","city":"Corvallis","state":"OR","line1":"3200 S.W.

Understanding and predicting stream flow permanence in response to increasing aridity (Jaeger et al., 2014) is the essential first step to mitigating ecological drought and subsequent management of systems that will be resilient in the face of climate change. Yet, our understanding and available measurements of water availability in the headwaters at a landscape extent in the Northwest is surprisingly incomplete. Analysis of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), a primary source for mapping and classifying streams and water availability, revealed that classifications were correct only about 50% of the time (Fritz et al., 2013). One goal of the proposed project is to create the Headwaters Intermittency Prediction (HIP) tool for use by land managers to provide predictions of flow permanence for user-selected headwaters streams in the study areas with potential to be expanded to predict flow permanence of any stream in the Northwest with near daily\/weekly updates based on remote sensing (e.g., snow extent) data availability. The ecological value of the HIP tool will be shown by incorporating HIP output into existing vulnerability assessments for native trout across the Northwest providing novel insights into the potential consequences of spatial variation in water availability for these species as well as a timely management tool. Secondly, development of citizen science-based, low cost (&lt;$20\/unit), headwater streamflow discharge estimation tools for future refinement of water availability assessments also represents a novel approach to providing large volumes of useful data and for engaging our partners (NPS) and the public at large in this effort to develop essential headwaters stream monitoring data. These products with accompanying support documentation will be developed in cooperation with EPA, Idaho Dept of Env Quality, USFS, Trout Unlimited, BLM, Sauk-Suiattle Tribe, and others. Collectively, this project will provide land managers an unprecedented view of high resolution landscape scale water availability critical for threatened aquatic species."}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"}],"files":[{"imageWidth":3998,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-09-15T21:31:03.000Z","title":"Upper Whitehorse Creek, Oregon - Credit: Jason Dunham","imageHeight":2998,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/57daf234e4b090824ffc323c?f=__disk__b8%2F24%2F2a%2Fb8242a1fb23de3b48576e22f8c96cc60e04c2a5f","processed":false,"size":5421694,"useForPreview":true,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"70830942187a93dc6034f1df3205e9a1"},"name":"UpperWhitehorseCreek_OR2_JasonDunham_USGS.JPG","pathOnDisk":"__disk__b8\/24\/2a\/b8242a1fb23de3b48576e22f8c96cc60e04c2a5f","contentType":"image\/jpeg"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/57daf234e4b090824ffc323c?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/57daf234e4b090824ffc323c?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=57daf234e4b090824ffc323c&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=57daf234e4b090824ffc323c&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=57daf234e4b090824ffc323c&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=57daf234e4b090824ffc323c","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/57daf234e4b090824ffc323c\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/57daf234e4b090824ffc323c","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"IdentifyingResi.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Kyle Blasch","Thomas Sando","Jason Dunham"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"],"funding_years":"2016","fy":"2016"},"5006c438e4b0abf7ce733f44":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"5006c438e4b0abf7ce733f44","title":"Improving Understanding of Threats to Whitebark Pine in the Western US: Quantifying Climate Change Effects on Mountain Pine Beetle Outbreaks","body":"<div>Whitebark pine is a high-elevation, important tree species that provides critical habitat for wildlife and supplies valued ecosystem services. These trees currently face multiple threats, including attack by the mountain pine beetle, which has recently killed whitebark pines over much of the western U.S. Climate is an important factor in these outbreaks, and future warming is expected to affect epidemics. Our project developed statistical models of outbreaks in whitebark pine for three regions: the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the Northern U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the Cascade Range. We used these models to understand climate\/beetle outbreak relationships, evaluate climatic causes of recent outbreaks, and estimate the potential for future outbreaks given projections of climate change. The models fit the observations well, indicating confidence in their reliability. Climate influenced mountain pine beetle outbreaks through fall and winter temperatures, which are direct effects on beetles, as well as via reduced summer precipitation which increases drought stress on trees. Recent outbreaks were caused by warming and drought in the early 2000s. We found that, compared with a baseline of 1985-1994 when little beetle activity occurred, future climate will be more favorable for mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, our preliminary results indicate that some projections were similar to or exceed the climate favorability of conditions during the recent severe and extensive outbreak (2000-2009). Variability existed among outbreak projections as a result of the amount of future warming and changes in precipitation, which are functions of climate model, emissions scenario, and decade. Our project provides evidence of the importance of climate for influencing recent and future beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine forests. We recommend that land managers and decision makers consider the impacts of expected climate change on mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine when planning conservation actions.<\/div>\n","parentId":"5006c2c9e4b0abf7ce733f42","contacts":[{"name":"Jeffrey A.

Current climate change assessments omit key community health concerns, which are vital to successful adaptation plans, particularly for Indigenous communities. Descriptive scaling techniques, employed in facilitated workshops with two Indigenous communities, tested the efficacy of ranking six key indicators of community health in relation to projected impacts to shellfish habitat and shoreline archaeological sites stemming from changes in the biophysical environment. Findings demonstrate that: when shellfish habitat and archaeological resources are impacted, so is Indigenous community health; not all community health indicators are equally impacted; and, the community health indicators of highest concern are not necessarily the same indicators most likely to be impacted. Based on the findings and feedback from community participants, exploratory trials were successful; Indigenous-specific health indicators may be useful to Indigenous communities who are assessing climate change sensitivities and creating adaptation plans.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["504665f1e4b0241d49d62cc8"],"contacts":[{"name":"Jamie Donatuto","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Eric E.

For this reason, regionally-specific projections of climate and environmental change are important to help those who want to plan how best to adapt. The goal of this&nbsp;project was to use the latest global climate models&nbsp;and state of the science models of vegetation and hydrology, to describe what the latest science says about the Northwest\u2019s future climate, vegetation, and hydrology. Researchers in the project began by evaluating the ability of climate models to simulate observed climate patterns in the Northwest region. The best-performing models were \u2018downscaled\u2019, that is, remapped onto the finer grids used in models of hydrology and vegetation. The researchers used the best performing models to project likely future changes to the Northwest\u2019s climate, hydrology, and vegetation.&nbsp;One product of this work is a series of freely available datasets that can be used to address specific management questions. These datasets are compatible with other hydrological and ecological modeling efforts and represent a next-generation climate change framework for land managers. This framework supports a range of management activities to increase the resilience of Northwest ecosystems, agricultural systems, and built environments. It allows the development of tools to help land managers identify the most vulnerable areas in the region and to develop strategies for reducing the impacts of climate change.<br> <br> This project was funded jointly by the Department of the Interior\u2019s Northwest Climate Science Center&nbsp;and by the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration\u2019s Climate Impacts Research Consortium.

environment: hydrometerological projections","body":"This metadata record documents multiple individual datasets, specifically the change from historical (1950-2005) for 12 hydrometerological variables projected by 3 Global Circulation Models (CanESM2, CNRM-CM5, and CCSM4) over 2 future time periods (2050s and 2080s), for one Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP 8.5).&nbsp;The variables include:&nbsp;Water Deficit, Spring (March-May), Water Deficit, Summer (July-September),&nbsp;Potential Evapotranspiration, Spring (March-May),&nbsp;Potential Evapotranspiration, Summer (July-September),&nbsp;Total Runoff, Summer (June-August),&nbsp;Total Runoff, Spring (March-May),&nbsp;Soil Moisture, Summer (July-September),&nbsp;Evapotranspiration, Spring

Winter Precipitation Captured in April 1st Snowpack.&nbsp;","purpose":"This project is an effort to understand the projections of climate change on the Northwest's fish, wildlife, hydrology, and ecosystem services. The projections used for this project come from meteorological outputs from global climate model(GCM) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) under RCP 8.5 over the years 2006 - 2100. The experiment RCP 8.5 is a high emissions scenarios which represents a 'business as usual' continuation of our current emissions. The first step in this project is to downscale the global climate model outputs from their coarse resolution to a resolution that is more useful for modellers. We utilize the statistical downscaling method of MACA (Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs method). The second step is to use the downscaled climate data in secondary modeling efforts for hydrology. For this project, we utilized the VIC (Variable Infiltration Capacity) hydrology model. On the website, we provide both a data portal for the downscaled climate, hydrology and vegetation datasets as well as a visualization of some of the projections from these different modeling efforts.","parentId":"5318c6bfe4b0ae6e9d5a3bb3","contacts":[{"name":"Meade Krosby","type":"Process Contact","contactType":"person","email":"mkrosby@uw.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington Climate Impacts Group"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"+1 206 221-2997","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"98195-5674","country":"USA","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","line1":"3737 Brooklyn Ave NE"}}},{"name":"Philip W.

describing projected changes in climate, hydrology and vegetation for the 21st century over the Northwestern US. The raw data is available in netCDF format, which is a standard data file format for weather forecasting\/climate change\/GIS applications. However, the sheer size of these datasets and the specific file format (netCDF) for data access pose significant barriers to data access for many users. This is a particular challenge for many natural\/cultural resource managers and others working on conservation efforts in the Pacific Northwest. The goal of this project was&nbsp;to increase the accessibility of the Integrated Scenarios datasets to a broader range of stakeholders. The Integrated Scenarios website, developed through this project,&nbsp;provides a repository of information about the different models and products, a data portal for downloading&nbsp;datasets, and a set of visualizations from the&nbsp;different modeling efforts.","parentId":"55130c4fe4b02e76d75c0755","contacts":[{"name":"Katherine Hegewisch","type":"Principal

How climate warming influences the spread of hybridization and loss of native genomes poses difficult ecological and evolutionary questions with little empirical information to guide conservation management decisions3. Here we combine long-term genetic monitoring data with high-resolution climate and stream temperature predictions to evaluate how recent climate warming has influenced the spatio-temporal spread of human-mediated hybridization between threatened native westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi) and non-native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), the world\u2019s most widely introduced invasive fish4. Despite widespread release of millions of rainbow trout over the past century within the Flathead River system5, a large relatively pristine watershed in western North America, historical samples revealed that hybridization was prevalent only in one (source) population. During a subsequent 30-year period of accelerated warming, hybridization spread rapidly and was strongly linked to interactions between climatic drivers\u2014precipitation and temperature\u2014and distance to the source population. Specifically, decreases in spring precipitation and increases in summer stream temperature probably promoted upstream expansion of hybridization throughout the system. This study shows that rapid climate warming can exacerbate interactions between native and non-native species through invasive hybridization, which could spell genomic extinction for many species.","parentId":"50465251e4b0241d49d62c7c","linkParentIds":["506dd262e4b002b5ec71a9a3"],"contacts":[{"name":"Nature Publishing Group","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Clint C.

However, genomic variation is strongly influenced by complex and dynamic interactions between environmental and community effects. Failure to consider both effects on evolutionary dynamics simultaneously can lead to incomplete, spurious, or erroneous conclusions about the mechanisms driving genomic variation. We highlight the need for a landscape community genomics (LCG) framework to help to motivate and challenge scientists in diverse fields to consider a more holistic, interdisciplinary perspective on the genomic evolution of multi-species communities in complex environments.","parentId":"50465251e4b0241d49d62c7c","contacts":[{"name":"Brian K.

Increasingly, current management is focused on core or priority areas containing the highest densities of breeding birds with little regard to understanding connectivity within and among areas. The most fundamental objective of species conservation is to first identify and subsequently maintain a set of viable and connected populations. Therefore, if management emphasis on core areas is to be successful for long-term conservation, it is important to know (1) the spatial delineation of breeding populations across the range-wide distribution of sage-grouse, (2) how primary populations located in high quality habitat are interconnected across regions of lower population densities and less suitable habitat, and (3) the spatial scale and relative importance of landscape features that influence gene flow.\n<br> \n<br> The working model for spatial organization of the range-wide distribution of sage-grouse likely consists primarily of numerous small populations in the periphery surrounding large core populations. In this study, we used non-invasive genetic data obtained from feathers collected at leks (breeding locations) to test this model and to understand the processes that underlie the spatial pattern of populations. Genetic data provide unique information on individual movements or dispersals and subsequent mating, as expressed through gene flow. Barriers to dispersal can fragment large populations, restrict exchange among small populations, and limit the ability of populations to respond to environmental stressors or changes in sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) land cover. Therefore, understanding how individuals disperse within and among breeding populations is important for maintaining genetic diversity, to sustain populations that are experiencing declining trends, or to recolonize extirpated populations when suitable habitat remains.\n<br> \n<br> We will first use information on genetic relatedness derived from individual-, lek-, and population-based analyses to better delineate the range-wide network of breeding populations. We will then combine genetic data with landscape models of cost-surfaces to identify characteristics of barriers, including geographic distance, topographic features, and anthropogenic land uses that influence dispersal and genetic exchange. These results are important for incorporating landscape and genetic connectivity into conservation planning to delineate core or priority populations, and to reduce population fragmentation, isolation, and subsequent risk of extirpation.&nbsp;","parentId":"502aacabe4b0a8e4a0fdb1a6","contacts":[{"name":"Steven T Knick","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey, Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Sara J Oyler-McCance","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey Fort Collins Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"landscape"},{"name":"gene flow"},{"name":"Greater Sage-Grouse"},{"name":"conservation"},{"name":"Corridors"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-11-05T07:54:51.674-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-03-16T09:52:31.518-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"processed":false,"size":366076,"dateUploaded":"2013-11-05T08:02:24.000Z","name":"Peer Reviewed Study Plan (Knick, Oyler-McCance).pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__92\/89\/73\/928973ec3e773ed68970f0f3031c84440f2f235d","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/527906bbe4b0c04ac3417acc?f=__disk__92%2F89%2F73%2F928973ec3e773ed68970f0f3031c84440f2f235d"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/527906bbe4b0c04ac3417acc","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"LandscapeInflue.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Steven T Knick","Sara J Oyler-McCance"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"574744b8e4b07e28b663d894":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5318ba1ae4b0ae6e9d5a3b7c","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Landscape integrity HCA and corridors from four integrity-derived resistance surfaces","relatedTitle":"Creating Practitioner-driven, Science-based Plans for Connectivity Conservation in a Changing Climate: A Collaborative Assessment of Climate-Connectivity Needs in the Washington-British Columbia Transboundary Region","id":"574744b8e4b07e28b663d894","relatedId":"5318ba1ae4b0ae6e9d5a3b7c","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/574744b8e4b07e28b663d894","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Creating Practitioner-driven, Science-based Plans for Connectivity Conservation in a Changing Climate: A Collaborative Assessment of Climate-Connectivity Needs in the Washington-British Columbia Transboundary Region","relatedTitle":"Landscape integrity HCA and corridors from four integrity-derived resistance surfaces","id":"5318ba1ae4b0ae6e9d5a3b7c","relatedId":"574744b8e4b07e28b663d894","annotation":null}]},"id":"574744b8e4b07e28b663d894","title":"Landscape integrity HCA and corridors from four integrity-derived resistance surfaces","body":"This raster combines linkages developed from four landscape integrity-derived resistance surfaces: linear, low sensitivity, medium sensitivity, and high sensitivity.

Although the database was derived for management purposes, the scientific community has expressed interest in its research capacity. As with any derived data, it is critical to understand inherent limitations to maximise the utility of the dataset without compromising the inferences. The classified severity product in particular is of limited use to research due to a lack of both consistency in developing class thresholds and empirical relationships with ecological metrics. Here we review the products available and their development process, and characterise and quantify the limitations of the classified burn severity data product based on the use of highly variable and subjective classification thresholds. We suggest a framework for overcoming these limitations by developing a more robust classified product that will support ecological management and applications. This framework utilises field data to develop consistent, ecologically based thresholds that incorporate existing ecoregion classifications from LANDFIRE or other fire management frameworks already widely integrated into planning efforts.","parentId":"53189314e4b051b1b924e9e5","contacts":[{"name":"Crystal Kolden","oldPartyId":66564,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"ckolden@uidaho.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Crystal","lastName":"Kolden","organization":{"displayText":"University of Idaho"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alistair Smith","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Idaho"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"John Abatzoglou","oldPartyId":64914,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"jabatzoglou@uidaho.edu","active":true,"firstName":"John","lastName":"Abatzoglou","organization":{"displayText":"University of Idaho"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/paper\/WF15082.htm","title":"Kolden et al. 2015","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Fire"},{"name":"Burn Severity"},{"name":"LANDFIRE"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015-09-14","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-01-11T12:55:44.374-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-01-11T12:57:50.155-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"International Journal of Wildland Fire","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Volume","value":"24"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Issue","value":"7"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Pages","value":"1023-1028"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI Number","value":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/WF15082"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Crystal Kolden","Alistair Smith","John Abatzoglou"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"574dfc46e4b07e28b66901f4":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/542468d5e4b037b608f9ec91","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Literature Catalog of Fire-Related Climate Adaptation Actions","relatedTitle":"The Available Science Assessment Project (ASAP): Evaluating the Supporting Science behind Climate Adaptation Actions","id":"574dfc46e4b07e28b66901f4","relatedId":"542468d5e4b037b608f9ec91","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/574dfc46e4b07e28b66901f4","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"The Available Science Assessment Project (ASAP): Evaluating the Supporting Science behind Climate Adaptation Actions","relatedTitle":"Literature Catalog of Fire-Related Climate Adaptation Actions","id":"542468d5e4b037b608f9ec91","relatedId":"574dfc46e4b07e28b66901f4","annotation":null}]},"id":"574dfc46e4b07e28b66901f4","title":"Literature Catalog of Fire-Related Climate Adaptation Actions","body":"EcoAdapt staff located and compiled relevant gray literature from Northwest national forests (e.g., forest management plans, fire management plans and policies, climate change strategy documents) written between 1986-2015, and categorized the ways in which fire-related climate adaptation actions appear in these documents.<br>\n<br>\nA coding system was created to review and catalog how climate adaptation actions appear in each document.

The disruptions it is causing require that we change the way we consider conservation and resource management in order to ensure the future of habitats, species, and human communities. Practitioners often struggle with how to identify and prioritize specific climate adaptation actions (CAAs). Management actions may have a higher probability of being successful if they are informed by available scientific knowledge and findings; a systematic review process provides a mechanism to scientifically assess management questions. By evaluating specific actions on scientific knowledge and findings, we may be able to increase management effectiveness and efficiency. The goal of the Available Science Assessment Project (ASAP) is to synthesize and evaluate the body of scientific knowledge on specific, on-the-ground CAAs to determine the conditions, timeframes, and geographic areas where particular CAAs may be most effective for resource managers. We have derived a methodology that utilizes interviews, a systematic review process, and extensive engagement with natural resource managers and scientists throughout the Northwest Climate Science Center (NW CSC) region.

However, if forests can be managed to retain snow longer, some of these environmental and financial impacts may be mitigated. Recent results from our research team demonstrate that in areas with relatively warm winters, strategically-cut forest gaps could offset climatic warming by increasing snow retention on the landscape and delaying runoff. However, in areas with colder winters, the opposite is true, as snow lasts longer under the forest canopy. We will map these climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect snow duration in different locations and testing those predictions against careful observations from our field sites and a network of citizen scientists. Working with regional forest and water managers, we will identify strategies for applying these findings to decision-making, linking climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management. Results from this project will help managers to act strategically to maximize snow retention (protecting forests in some areas while opening gaps in others), providing more water later in the season for hydropower, agriculture, and fish flows.","parentId":"541b07bee4b01571b3d654fc","contacts":[{"name":"Timothy Link","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"tlink@uidaho.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"Link","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Susan E.

Study sites were located in the upper McKenzie (McK) River watershed, approximately 100 km east of Corvallis, Oregon, on the western slope of the Cascade Range and in the Middle Fork Willamette (MFW) watershed, located to the south of the McKenzie. &nbsp;The sites were designated based on elevation, with a range of 1110-1480 m. &nbsp;Distributed snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) observations were collected via monthly manual snow courses from 1 November through 1 April and bi-weekly thereafter. Snow courses spanned 500 m of forested terrain and 500 m of adjacent open terrain. &nbsp;Snow depth observations were collected approximately every 10 m and SWE was measured every 100 m along the snow courses with a federal snow sampler. &nbsp;These data are raw observations and have not been quality controlled in any way. &nbsp;Distance along the transect was estimated in the field.\n<br> \n<br> OSU_SnowDepth Summary:&nbsp;10-minute snow depth observations collected at OSU met stations in the upper McKenzie River Watershed and the Middle Fork Willamette Watershed during Water Years 2012-2014. &nbsp;Each meterological tower was deployed to represent either a forested or an open area at a particular site, and generally the locations were paired, with a meterological station deployed in the forest and in the open area at a single site. &nbsp;These data were collected in conjunction with manual snow course observations, and the meterological stations were located in the approximate center of each forest or open snow course transect. &nbsp;These data have undergone basic quality control. &nbsp;See manufacturer specifications for individual instruments to determine sensor accuracy. &nbsp;This file was compiled from individual raw data files (named \"RawData.txt\" within each site and year directory) provided by OSU, along with metadata of site attributes. &nbsp;We converted the Excel-based timestamp (seconds since origin) to a date, changed the NaN flags for missing data to NA, and added site attributes such as site name and cover. &nbsp;We replaced positive values with NA, since snow depth values in raw data are negative (i.e., flipped, with some correction to use the height of the sensor as zero). &nbsp;Thus, positive snow depth values in the raw data equal negative snow depth values. &nbsp;Second, the sign of the data was switched to make them positive. Then, the smooth.m (MATLAB) function was used to roughly smooth the data, with a moving window of 50 points.\n<br> Third, outliers were removed. &nbsp;All values higher than the smoothed values +10, were replaced with NA. In some cases, further single point outliers were removed.\n<br> \n<br> OSU_Met Summary:&nbsp;Raw, 10-minute meteorological observations collected at OSU met stations in the upper McKenzie River Watershed and the Middle Fork Willamette Watershed during Water Years 2012-2014. &nbsp;Each meterological tower was deployed to represent either a forested or an open area at a particular site, and generally the locations were paired, with a meterological station deployed in the forest and in the open area at a single site. &nbsp;These data were collected in conjunction with manual snow course observations, and the meteorological stations were located in the approximate center of each forest or open snow course transect. These stations were deployed to collect numerous meteorological variables, of which snow depth and wind speed are included here. &nbsp;These data are raw datalogger output and have not been quality controlled in any way. &nbsp;See manufacturer specifications for individual instruments to determine sensor accuracy. &nbsp;This file was compiled from individual raw data files (named \"RawData.txt\" within each site and year directory) provided by OSU, along with metadata of site attributes. &nbsp;We converted the Excel-based timestamp (seconds since origin) to a date, changed the NaN and 7999 flags for missing data to NA, and added site attributes such as site name and cover.\n<br> \n<br> OSU_Location Summary: &nbsp;Location Metadata for manual snow course observations and meteorological sensors. &nbsp;These data are compiled from GPS data for which the horizontal accuracy is unknown, and from processed hemispherical photographs. &nbsp;They have not been quality controlled in any way.\n<br> \n<br> OSU_SnowCourse Attributes: &nbsp;Institution - Oregon State University (OSU);&nbsp;Watershed - McKenzie (McK) or Middle Fork Willamette (MFW);&nbsp;Site - site name;&nbsp;RelativeElev - elevation category, used in study design. &nbsp;Low, Mid, or High;&nbsp;Cover - designates whether location was in the portion of the transect categorized as open or forest;&nbsp;WY - Water Year, &nbsp;e.g. Water Year 2013 = 2012-10-01 through 2013-09-30.;&nbsp;Year;&nbsp;Month;&nbsp;Day;&nbsp;Julian - Julian day, starting with the beginning of the year, &nbsp;i.e., January 1 = 1 and February 1 = 32;&nbsp;Date - mm\/dd\/yyyy;&nbsp;Value - observed value;&nbsp;Units - SWE_cm = snow water equivalent in cm, or Depth_cm = snow depth, in cm.;&nbsp;Distance - distance along the transect in m, estimated;&nbsp;Sample - sample number along the trasect, to tie to location metadata (only for SWE).\n<br> \n<br> OSU_SnowDepth Attributes:&nbsp;Date - MM\/DD\/YY HH:MM with hours in 24 hour format;&nbsp;SnowDepth - QCd snow depth in cm;&nbsp;DateTimeUTC - Date and time of observation in UTC. &nbsp;yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss;&nbsp;DateTimeLocal - Date and time observations in Pacific Standard Time (-8 UTC) and adjusted for Pacific Daylight Time (-7 UTC). &nbsp;yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss;&nbsp;UTCoffset - Number of hours of offset from UTC time, i.e., -8 during PST and -7 during PDT;&nbsp;WY - Water Year, &nbsp;e.g. Water Year 2013 = 2012-10-01 through 2013-09-30. &nbsp;Based on local time.;&nbsp;OSUName - Name of met station used internally by OSU;&nbsp;Cover - Forest or Open;&nbsp;Watershed - McKenzie (McK) or MF Willamette (MFW);&nbsp;Site - General site name without regard to forest cover;&nbsp;Status - qc, for quality controlled;&nbsp;Institution - Oregon State University (OSU)\n<br> \n<br> OSU_Met Attributes: &nbsp;Date - Date and time of observation in Pacific Standard Time with no correction for Daylight Savings Time. &nbsp;mm\/dd\/yy hh:mm or mm\/dd\/yyyy hh:mm;

However, if forests can be managed to retain snow longer, some of these environmental and financial impacts may be mitigated. Recent results from our research team demonstrate that in areas with relatively warm winters, strategically-cut forest gaps could offset climatic warming by increasing snow retention on the landscape and delaying runoff. However, in areas with colder winters, the opposite is true, as snow lasts longer under the forest canopy. We will map these climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect snow duration in different locations and testing those predictions against careful observations from our field sites and a network of citizen scientists. Working with regional forest and water managers, we will identify strategies for applying these findings to decision-making, linking climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management. Results from this project will help managers to act strategically to maximize snow retention (protecting forests in some areas while opening gaps in others), providing more water later in the season for hydropower, agriculture, and fish flows.","parentId":"541b07bee4b01571b3d654fc","contacts":[{"name":"Travis Roth","type":"Point of Contact","contactType":"person","email":"rothtra@science.oregonstate.edu","firstName":"Travis","lastName":"Roth","company":"Oregon State University","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Anne Nolin","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"anne.nolin@gmail.com","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Susan E.

This study\u2019s goal was to map and monitor cheatgrass performance to identify where and when cheatgrass dieoff occurred in the Northern Great Basin and to discover how this phenomenon was affected by climatic, topographic, and edaphic variables. We also examined how fire affected cheatgrass performance. Land managers and scientists are concerned by cheatgrass dieoff because it can increase land degradation, and its causes and effects are not fully known. To better understand the scope of cheatgrass dieoff, we developed multiple ecological models that integrated remote sensing data with geophysical and biophysical data. The models\u2019<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><i>R<sup>2<\/sup><\/i><span><span>&nbsp;<\/span>ranged from 0.71 to 0.88, and their root mean squared errors (RMSEs) ranged from 3.07 to 6.95. Validation of dieoff data showed that 41% of pixels within independently developed dieoff polygons were accurately classified as dieoff, whereas 2% of pixels outside of dieoff polygons were classified as dieoff. Site potential, a long-term spatial average of cheatgrass cover, dominated the development of the cheatgrass performance model. Fire negatively affected cheatgrass performance 1 year postfire, but by the second year postfire performance exceeded prefire levels. The landscape-scale monitoring study presented in this paper helps increase knowledge about recent rangeland dynamics, including where cheatgrass dieoffs occurred and how cheatgrass responded to fire. This knowledge can help direct further investigation and\/or guide land management activities that can capitalize on, or mitigate the effects of, cheatgrass dieoff.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["502a9feae4b0a8e4a0fdb170"],"contacts":[{"name":"Stephen P.

cheatgrass production and dieoff in the Great Basin using remote sensing data and ecological models","body":"<p>Since January 2011, the EROS team studying cheatgrass in the Great Basin has made significant strides developing datasets that identify cheatgrass extents and abundances and cheatgrass dieoff in and around the Winnemucca, Nevada area. Additionally, the team, in partnership with the BLM, received money from the USGS\u2019 Northwest Climate Science Center to expand our cheatgrass dieoff study area to most of the northern Great Basin. In the Winnemucca area, we developed a regression-tree model, trained on Peterson\u2019s cheatgrass maps, that generated a time series (2000 \u2013 2010) of cheatgrass extents and abundances and then analyzed the relationships between this cheatgrass time series and spatially explicit site-specific variables like elevation, slope, aspect, and a dynamic variable, annual precipitation. We used the cheatgrass time-series dataset to build a time series (2000 \u2013 2010) of weather-based ecosystem performance anomaly models that identified cheatgrass dieoff areas. In the expanded study area covering the northern Great Basin, we are currently developing the time series of cheatgrass extents and abundances. Future plans include developing a time series of weather-based ecosystem performance anomalies to identify areas of cheatgrass dieoff across most of the northern Great Basin. Our final objective is develop cheatgrass dieoff probability models that will use regression-tree techniques along with future climate data to predict areas of future cheatgrass extents and abundances and potential areas of future cheatgrass dieoff.<\/p>","parentId":"502a9feae4b0a8e4a0fdb170","contacts":[{"name":"Stephen Boyte","oldPartyId":14527,"contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Bruce K Wylie","oldPartyId":11505,"contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Donald James Major","oldPartyId":36149,"contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZxcCJcDGXXQ","title":"YouTube Video","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Cheatgrass"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Climate Change"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Great Basin"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2012-03-15","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2012-09-06T15:10:14.654-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-25T09:48:16.106-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Year","value":"2012"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"webinar ","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Stephen Boyte","Bruce K Wylie","Donald James Major"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"5047721ae4b067bd38f7f502":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"5047721ae4b067bd38f7f502","title":"Maps","parentId":"502a9fe2e4b0a8e4a0fdb16e","systemTypes":["Folder"],"dates":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2012-09-05T09:39:06.735-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-26T18:41:45.458-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=5047721ae4b067bd38f7f502&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=5047721ae4b067bd38f7f502&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=5047721ae4b067bd38f7f502&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=5047721ae4b067bd38f7f502","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5047721ae4b067bd38f7f502\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46"},"5006e99ee4b0abf7ce733f58":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"5006e99ee4b0abf7ce733f58","title":"Marshes to Mudflats: Climate Change Effects Along a Latitudinal Gradient in the Pacific Northwest","body":"<div>In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However, at most sites mid sea-level rise projections led to the loss of middle and high marsh and a gain in low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.&nbsp;<\/div>\n","parentId":"5006c2c9e4b0abf7ce733f42","linkParentIds":["560046e7e4b05d6c4e50459f"],"contacts":[{"name":"John Y

Such projections are based upon the assumptions that (1) species respond primarily to broad-scale climatic regimes, or (2) that variation in climate at fine spatial scales is less relevant at coarse spatial scales. However, in montane forest landscapes, high degrees of microclimate variability could influence occupancy dynamics and distributions of forest species. Using high-resolution bird survey and under-canopy air temperature data, we tested the hypothesis that the high vagility of most forest bird species combined with the heterogeneous thermal regime of mountain landscapes would enable them to adjust initial settlement decisions to track their thermal niches.","parentId":"502aaeafe4b0a8e4a0fdb1b9","contacts":[{"name":"Sarah Frey","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Oregon State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Adam S.

(Dendroctonus ponderosae)","body":"Cold-induced mortality is a key factor driving mountain pine beetle( <em>Dendroctonus ponderosae<\/em>) population dynamics. In this species, the supercooling point (SCP) is representative of mortality induced by acute cold exposure. Mountain pine beetle SCP and associated cold-induced mortality fluctuate throughout a generation, with the highest SCPs prior to and following winter. Using observed SCPs of field-collected D. ponderosae larvae throughout the developmental season and associated phloem temperatures, we developed a mechanistic model that describes the SCP distribution of a population as a function of daily changes in the temperature-dependent processes leading to gain and loss of cold tolerance. It is based on the changing proportion of individuals in three states: (1) a non cold-hardened, feeding state, (2) an intermediate state in which insects have ceased feeding, voided their gut content and eliminated as many ice-nucleating agents as possible from the body, and (3) a fully cold-hardened state where insects have accumulated a maximum concentration of cryoprotectants (e.g. glycerol). Shifts in the proportion of individuals in each state occur in response to the driving variables influencing the opposite rates of gain and loss of cold hardening. The level of cold-induced mortality predicted by the model and its relation to extreme winter temperature is in good agreement with a range of field and laboratory observations. Our model predicts that cold tolerance of D. ponderosae varies within a season, among seasons, and among geographic locations depending on local climate. This variability is an emergent property of the model, and has important implications for understanding the insect's response to seasonal fluctuations in temperature, as well as population response to climate change. Because cold-induced mortality is but one of several major influences of climate on D. ponderosae population dynamics, we suggest that this model be integrated with others simulating the insect's biology.","purpose":"Our objective was to develop a process-based model of its cold tolerance that follows the general physiological principles of cold

approximately half of their historical distribution across western North America. Sage-grouse are a candidate for endangered species listing due to habitat and population fragmentation coupled with inadequate regulation to control development in critical areas. Conservation planning would benefit from accurate maps delineating required habitats and movement corridors. However, developing a species distribution model that incorporates the diversity of habitats used by sage-grouse across their widespread distribution has statistical and logistical challenges. We first identified the ecological minimums limiting sage-grouse, mapped similarity to the multivariate set of minimums, and delineated connectivity across a 920,000 km<sup>2<\/sup> region. We partitioned a Mahalanobis D<sup>2<\/sup> model of habitat use into k separate additive components each representing independent combinations of species\u2013habitat relationships to identify the ecological minimums required by sage-grouse. We constructed the model from abiotic, land cover, and anthropogenic variables measured at leks (breeding) and surrounding areas within 5 km. We evaluated model partitions using a random subset of leks and historic locations and selected D<sup>2<\/sup> (k = 10) for mapping a habitat similarity index (HSI). Finally, we delineated connectivity by converting the mapped HSI to a resistance surface. Sage-grouse required sagebrush-dominated landscapes containing minimal levels of human land use. Sage-grouse used relatively arid regions characterized by shallow slopes, even terrain, and low amounts of forest, grassland, and agriculture in the surrounding landscape. Most populations were interconnected although several outlying populations were isolated because of distance or lack of habitat corridors for exchange. Land management agencies currently are revising land-use plans and designating critical habitat to conserve sage-grouse and avoid endangered species listing. Our results identifying attributes important for delineating habitats or modeling connectivity will facilitate conservation and management of landscapes important for supporting current and future sage-grouse populations.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["502aacabe4b0a8e4a0fdb1a6"],"contacts":[{"name":"Steven T.

Cheatgrass dominated areas experience more fires that burn more land than in native ecosystems, resulting in economic and resource losses. Therefore, the reduced production, or absence, of cheatgrass in previously invaded areas during years of adequate precipitation could be seen as a windfall. However, this cheatgrass dieoff phenomenon creates other problems for land managers like accelerated soil erosion, loss of early spring food supply for livestock and wildlife, and unknown recovery pathways. We used satellite data and scientific techniques to map annual estimated cheatgrass percent cover and areas of cheatgrass dieoff in the western and central parts of the northern Great Basin from 2000 - 2010. For this same area, we developed a map of cheatgrass percent cover variability and another map that displays cheatgrass dieoff probability.<br> <br> These maps can assist land managers in understanding when and where cheatgrass did and did not exist over an extremely large landscape, and the maps can possibly explain characteristics of dieoff areas that can help researchers pinpoint the cause or causes of cheatgrass dieoff. The cheatgrass dieoff maps show that dieoff areas are spatially and temporally variable, or, in other words, a dieoff may afflict an area for a few years and then cheatgrass may return, only to dieoff again later. This pattern of variability can also persist in different areas. During the study period we estimated that, on average, about 2.6 million acres experienced cheatgrass dieoff annually.Restoring dieoff areas to a native ecosystem could be a goal of land managers, but until cheatgrass dieoff causes and natural recovery pathways are better understood, engaging in costly restoration activities may be unwise.<br> &nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"5006c1e5e4b0abf7ce733f3b","contacts":[{"name":"Bruce K Wylie","oldPartyId":11505,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"wylie@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey Earth Resources Observation and Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"605-594-6078","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Stephen Boyte","oldPartyId":14527,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"sboyte@usgs.gov","active":true,"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Boyte","organization":{"displayText":"Earth Resources Observation and Science"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"6055946171","streetAddress":{"zip":"57198","city":"Sioux Falls","state":"SD","line1":"47914 252Nd Street"},"buildingCode":"KMN","name":"Stephen Boyte\/GEOG\/CONT\/USGS\/DOI -

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate recent modifications and further refinements to a multi-layer plant canopy model for simulating temperature and water vapor within three diverse forest canopies: a 4.5-m tall aspen thicket, a 15-m tall aspen canopy, and a 60-m tall Douglas fir canopy. Performance of the model was strongly related to source strength and profile stability within the canopy. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) between simulated and observed values tended to be higher for the summer periods when there was much more heat and vapor added to the canopy space due to solar warming and transpiration. Conversely, RMSD for vapor pressure was lowest for the winter periods when vapor additions within the canopy space were minimal. RMSD for temperature ranged from 0.1&nbsp;&deg;C for the top of the 15-m aspen canopy during the winter to 1.6&nbsp;&deg;C for the bottom of the 4.5-m aspen thicket during the summer period. RMSD for vapor pressure ranged from 0.002&nbsp;kPa for the top of the 15-m aspen canopy during winter to 0.141&nbsp;kPa for the bottom of the 4.5-m aspen thicket during the summer. Unstable profile conditions were simulated better by the model than stable conditions for all sites. RMSD for temperature at the bottom of the 4.5-m aspen, 15-m aspen and 60-m Douglas fir were 0.89, 0.77, and 0.85&nbsp;&deg;C, respectively, for unstable conditions compared to 1.44, 0.89 and 1.16&nbsp;&deg;C for stable conditions. Stable profiles are more challenging to accurately simulate because dispersion within a stable profile is lower thereby creating larger gradients. Temperature differences between the bottom and above canopy sensors were within 3&nbsp;&deg;C for unstable conditions for all sites, but were as much as \u221210&nbsp;&deg;C under stable conditions. The model exhibited the greatest discrepancies relative to measurements in the 4.5-m aspen thicket under stable conditions, likely due to horizontal ejections from this relatively small patch of vegetation that could not be addressed by the one-dimensional model.

Unfortunately, not only are these valuable ecosystems understudied compared to others, but they are also among the most sensitive to climate change. Climate change threatens wetlands by altering temperature and precipitation, which cause changes in water level and water temperature. Due to this threat, the international community and domestic agencies alike have highlighted the need to better understand wetlands in the face of climate change, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to the Ramsar Convention, to the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service.<br> &nbsp;<br> Focusing on the Pacific Northwest region, this project substantially improves our understanding of wetlands and how they will respond to climate change. Researchers developed new methods to map and monitor wetlands, modeled historical and future wetland hydrologic conditions, and evaluated the impacts of climate change on wetlands and the species that rely on them.&nbsp; Results show that montane wetlands \u2013 those found in high altitudes \u2013 are particularly vulnerable to climate change, which is causing reduced snowpack and longer summer drought, threatening the species that depend on them. Amphibians in particular, such as the Cascades frog, rely on wetlands for breeding and are at risk of local extinction due to the loss of suitable habitat.<br> &nbsp;<br> This research produced information that is essential for managers seeking to understand the vulnerability of wetland ecosystems to climate change and to effectively plan for and mitigate its impacts. By studying wetlands in multiple locations throughout the Pacific Northwest, researchers discovered that the effects of climate change varied considerably between sites, suggesting that a one-size-fits all approach might not work\u2014rather, management efforts may need to be tailored accordingly from site to site.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<\/div>","purpose":"Wetlands are widely recognized as important ecosystems that provide critical services for natural communities and human society, including nutrient cycling, wildlife habitat and provisioning, water storage and filtration, carbon sequestration, and agriculture and recreation. Wetlands challenge our current scientific capacity because of their sheer number, their wide range of sizes, and their dynamic nature. As a result, wetlands are understudied compared to other ecosystem types. However, wetlands are thought to be among the most sensitive ecosystems to climate change, so the lack of dedicated scientific resources has accelerating consequences going forward. Our goal in this project was to address the deficiency in wetland resources by developing new approaches and technical tools to better understand wetlands in general and to more effectively manage and conserve wetlands under a changing climate. By focusing our efforts on a range of wetland types, our goal was to better characterize landscape-scale climate change impacts to wetlands across the Pacific Northwest region in support of ongoing assessment and adaptation efforts. Our approach was designed in collaboration with natural resource managers, and involved three methodological advances. First, using remote sensing approaches, we developed new methods for mapping wetlands and reconstructing historical wetland hydrologic dynamics. Second, we used the Variable Infiltration Capacity model, a regional-scale hydrologic model, to hindcast historical wetland dynamics and project the future impacts of climate change on wetlands. Third, we linked these approaches with ecological data to evaluate the impacts and risk of climate change to several classes of wetlands across three ecoregions of Washington state. In the process we developed or collected multiple new datasets on wetland distributions, dynamics, and species occupancy. This work has broad societal value in deepening our understanding of wetland dynamics over time; creating new tools that enable better management and conservation of wetlands and the ecological services that they provide; and enriching conservation and climate adaptation planning efforts with resource and evidence-based decision power.

Specific objectives include: (1) Identify how vulnerabilities and resiliencies of priority terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, individual species, and ecosystem services vary spatially in their response to climate change and non-climate change stressors; (2) Identify and prioritize implementable management responses to climate change based on spatial analysis, and describe how effectiveness of and trade-offs among potential management actions vary spatially; and (3) Develop an implementation handbook describing how to integrate climate vulnerability and adaptation strategies into specific planning and management operation levels (e.g., NEPA, forest plan revision) using case studies from Region 1 forests as examples. To achieve these objectives, we will we will work with scientists, land managers, and other stakeholders in Idaho and western Montana to select priority resources, spatially assess the vulnerabilities and resiliencies of those resources, and develop actionable management responses.

The dataset was generated by integrating eMODIS NDVI satellite data with independent variables that influence cheatgrass germination and growth into a regression-tree model. Individual pixel values range from 0 to 100 with an overall mean value of 9.85 and a standard deviation of 12.78. A mask covers areas not classified as shrub\/scrub or grass\/herbaceous by the 2001 National Land Cover Database. The mask also covers areas higher than 2000 meters in elevation because cheatgrass is unlikely to exist at more than 2% cover above this threshold. Cheatgrass is an invasive grass that has invaded much of the Great Basin. It grows from seed, usually early in spring, and rapidly matures, produces seed, and dies. Its presence can deplete early-season moisture reserves and put native vegetation at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, it contributes fine fuels that facilitate fire ignition and fire spread. Rangeland fires are often stand replacing events in sagebrush communities, commuities which historically dominated much of the northern Great Basin. Increasing fire return intervals, increasing fire intensities, land management practices, and development have all contributed to the fragmentation of sagebrush ecosystems, which are critical for greater sagegrouse survival.","purpose":"This dataset is designed to provide a near-real-time estimate of cheatgrass in the northern Great Basin for 2015 to optimize land management efforts to control cheatgrass, preserve critical greater sagegrouse habitat, and inform fire control and prevention. Timely maps of dynamic cheatgrass percent cover are needed in early summer for these purposes. Research shows that cheatgrass percent cover is spatially and temporally highly variable in arid and semiarid environments because cheatgrass germination and growth is highly sensitive to annual weather, especially precipitation totals and timing. Precipitation totals and timing are also spatially and temporally highly variable in these environments; therefore, this dataset is only representative of cheatgrass percent cover during 2015 and does not represent any other time period.","parentId":"5047720fe4b067bd38f7f4ff","contacts":[{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey","type":"Point of Contact","email":"custserv@usgs.gov","primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"605-594-6171","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"57198-0001","country":"USA","city":"Sioux Falls","state":"SD","line1":"47914 252nd Street"}}},{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey, CLIMATE & LAND-USE","type":"Distributor","email":"sboyte@usgs.gov","primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"605-594-6171","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"57198","city":"Sioux Falls","state":"SD","line1":"47914 252nd Street"}}},{"name":"Stephen Boyte","type":"Metadata Contact","email":"sboyte@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey, CLIMATE & LAND-USE"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"605-594-6171","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"57198","city":"Sioux Falls","state":"SD","line1":"47914 252nd Street"}}},{"name":"Stephen P.

As with the statewide analysis (see WHCWG 2010), the normalized least-cost corridor algorithms produced wall-to-wall linkage maps, with everygrid cell in the study area having a value that represented its deviation from the nearest least-cost movement route. This necessitated creating maps that displayed only values from zero (the optimum modeled route) to a species-specific linkage width cutoff to identify areas that contribute most to connectivity between each HCA pair. Because of the smaller extent of this analysis and the finer-scale data that were available, we chose cutoff values (Table 2.2, WHCWG 2012) that produced linkage zone widths that were somewhat narrower than those mapped at the statewide scale, while being mindful of the intent that linkage zones serve not only focal species, but other species and processes as well. Keeping linkage zones reasonably wide also acknowledges that there is still considerable uncertainty in GIS base data, resistance models, and other parameters used in our modeling process. We did not wish users of our products to assume that very narrow corridors necessarily indicate the areas most important for wildlife movement.&nbsp;This metadata record covers 2 datasets, for 2

As noted in Nu\u00f1ez (2011), the results using this method are exploratory and intended to be broad-scale and generic in nature, and are not intended to direct conservation resources to specific locations or organisms. The purpose of this specific layer, which is based on both temperature gradients and human land use patterns (landscape integrity), is to illustrate routes on the landscape between landscape integrity core areas that provide for unidirectional change in mean annual temperature between the core areas while avoiding areas of low landscape integrity (e.g., agricultural, urban, or transportation land use areas).","parentId":"5318c6bfe4b0ae6e9d5a3bb3","contacts":[{"name":"Meade Krosby","type":"Process Contact","contactType":"person","email":"mkrosby@uw.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University

planning in a changing climate:","body":"Data points intensively sampling 46 North American biomes were used to predict the geographic distribution of biomes from climate variables using the Random Forests classification tree. Techniques were incorporated to accommodate a large number of classes and to predict the future occurrence of climates beyond the contemporary climatic range of the biomes. Errors of prediction from the statistical model averaged 3.7%, but for individual biomes, ranged from 0% to 21.5%. In validating the ability of the model to identify climates without analogs, 78% of 1528 locations outside North America and 81% of land area of the Caribbean Islands were predicted to have no analogs among the 46 biomes. Biome climates were projected into the future according to low and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios of three General Circulation Models &nbsp;(cgcm, hadley, and consensus) for three periods, the decades surrounding 2030, 2060, and 2090. Prominent in the projections were (1) expansion of climates suitable for the tropical dry deciduous forests of Mexico, (2) expansion of climates typifying desertscrub biomes of western USA and northern Mexico, (3) stability of climates typifying the evergreen\u2013deciduous forests of eastern USA, and (4) northward expansion of climates suited to temperate forests, Great Plains grasslands, and montane forests to the detriment of taiga and tundra climates. Maps indicating either poor agreement among projections or climates without contemporary analogs identify geographic areas where land management programs would be most equivocal. Concentrating efforts and resources where projections are more certain can assure land managers a greater likelihood of success.<br>\n<br>\nBecause General Circulation Models (GCM) are key to understanding future climates, the tool we envision must take into account the variability in GCM output resulting from different model formulations and emissions scenarios. However, to land managers, variation represents uncertainty, and uncertainty often leads to inaction. Our approach was to emphasize similarities in responses projected from the disparate formulations rather than dwell on the differences. The tool must also contain provisions for identifying future climates with no contemporary analog because new climates may best be suited for species assemblages that do not exist today. To be useful, the scope of a vegetation model should be neither too broad to constrain local interpretation nor so parochial as to limit management options. It is mandatory, moreover, that this tool incorporates powerful statistical techniques that retain the robustness and flexibility necessary for anticipating and accommodating actual changes.<br>\n<br>\nOur analysis uses the biotic communities of Brown (1994), mapped and digitized by Brown et al. (1998). This classification system meshes well with our goals: It is based on distributions of flora and fauna without reliance on physiography, the coverage includes all of North America, and altitudinal zonation of vegetation is an integral part of the system. For simplicity, we use the term \"biome\" to reference the biotic communities. Previous analyses used this classification system for modeling climatic control of biome distributions in western USA. These analyses produced errors of fit (~10%) that largely resulted from an imperfect alignment between digitized polygons in the classification system and the digital elevation model used to generate point estimates of biome climates. Misalignment had greatest impact at borders of polygons, along shore lines, and on mountain peaks, and therefore, was of greatest source of error with small, irregularly shaped polygons and for biomes occurring in altitudinal sequence. In this analysis, we considered biomes from throughout North America and used supplemental information to alleviate adverse effects of the misaligned data files.<br>\n<br>\nWe built on the statistical modeling of Rehfeldt et al. (2006) to predict contemporary realized climatic niches of North American biomes. Ecological niche models have received considerable criticism mostly because of their inability to represent migration or colonization potentials, competitive interactions, and effects of enhanced CO2 on water-use efficiency. The first of these is not an issue. Niche modelers themselves make no claims of projecting species distributions, but instead emphasize that their models project suitable climates. Likewise, competitive interactions that limit species distributions can be defined climatically and are invalidated only when future climates have no contemporary analog. By predicting and projecting the occurrence of novel climates, statistical models can negate this second point of contention. However, it is true that correlative models are not yet capable of accounting for physiological impacts of enhanced CO2 on gas exchange and productivity. Such effects, however, are well characterized in only a few species, and impacts on species distributions are unknown. More research is required before effects of enhanced CO2 can be incorporated with credibility into vegetation models, whether correlative or mechanistic.","purpose":"Land managers require decision-support tools suitable for dealing with oncoming climate-mediated ecosystem changes. Progress has been made in converting climatically static vegetation simulators to climatically dynamic models, and guidelines are in use for managing future generations of the broadly dispersed Larix occidentalis of western North America and the narrow endemics, Picea chihuahuensis, P. mexicana, and P. martinezii of Mexico. Yet, for much of North America, comprehensive management guidelines do not exist. Our goal was to develop a statistically valid, climate-driven vegetation model suitable for land-use planning during a changing climate.","parentId":"5318c6bfe4b0ae6e9d5a3bb3","contacts":[{"name":"Gerald E.

Fourteen total study sites cover the western slopes and crest of the Cascade Range in WA and OR, and central and northern ID. Each study location includes one or more paired forest and open area in which to compare snow observations. A range of forest canopy densities and data collection strategies are represented, including paired manual snow courses, snow pits, automated sensors, and time-lapse images of snow measurement poles. Analysis and synthesis of all of these sites are presented in the data citation. Location attributes are provided as metadata for each site.","purpose":"Climate change is projected to cause earlier snowmelt, with potentially serious consequences for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and for municipal and agricultural water supplies. However, if forests can be managed to retain snow longer, some of these environmental and financial impacts may be mitigated. Recent results from our research team demonstrate that in areas with relatively warm winters, strategically-cut forest gaps could offset climatic warming by increasing snow retention on the landscape and delaying runoff. However, in areas with colder winters, the opposite is true, as snow lasts longer under the forest canopy. We will map these climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect snow duration in different locations and testing those predictions against careful observations from our field sites and a network of citizen scientists. Working with regional forest and water managers, we will identify strategies for applying these findings to decision-making, linking climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management. Results from this project will help managers to act strategically to maximize snow retention (protecting forests in some areas while opening gaps in others), providing more water later in the season for hydropower, agriculture, and fish flows.","parentId":"570c0f67e4b0ef3b7ca04ed1","contacts":[{"name":"Jessica Lundquist","oldPartyId":66563,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jdlund@u.washington.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Jessica","lastName":"Lundquist","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Susan E.

Species-specific responses in northeast Pacific tidal marshes","body":"<p>Coastal wetland plants are adapted to varying degrees of inundation. However, functional relationships between inundation and productivity are poorly characterized for most species. Determining species-specific tolerances to inundation is necessary to evaluate sea-level rise (SLR) effects on future marsh plant community composition, quantify organic matter inputs to marsh accretion, and inform predictive modeling of tidal wetland persistence. In 2 macrotidal estuaries in the northeast Pacific we grew 5 common species in experimental mesocosms across a gradient of tidal elevations to assess effects on growth. We also tested whether species abundance distributions along elevation gradients in adjacent marshes matched productivity profiles in the mesocosms. We found parabolic relationships between inundation and total plant biomass and shoot counts in&nbsp;<i>Spartina foliosa<\/i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Bolboschoenus maritimus<\/i>&nbsp;in California, USA, and in&nbsp;<i>Carex lyngbyei<\/i>&nbsp;in Oregon, USA, with maximum total plant biomass occurring at 38, 28, and 15% time submerged, respectively. However, biomass of&nbsp;<i>Salicornia pacifica<\/i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Juncus balticus<\/i>&nbsp;declined monotonically with increasing inundation. Inundation effects on the ratio of belowground to aboveground biomass varied inconsistently among species. In comparisons of field distributions with mesocosm results,&nbsp;<i>B. maritimus<\/i>,&nbsp;<i>C. lyngbyei<\/i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>J. balticus<\/i>&nbsp;were abundant in marshes at or above elevations corresponding with their maximum productivity; however,&nbsp;<i>S. foliosa<\/i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>S. pacifica<\/i>&nbsp;were frequently abundant at lower elevations corresponding with sub-optimal productivity. Our findings show species-level differences in how marsh plant growth may respond to future SLR and highlight the sensitivity of high marsh species such as&nbsp;<i>S. pacifica<\/i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>J. balticus<\/i>&nbsp;to increases in flooding.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50464660e4b0241d49d62c5d","50475751e4b067bd38f7f460"],"contacts":[{"name":"Christopher Janousek","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"cjanousek@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Kevin J.

Though statistical climatic envelope models are frequently used to project future scenarios for species distributions under climate change, these models are rarely tested using empirical data. We used long-term data on bird distributions and abundance covering five states in the western US and in the Canadian province of British Columbia to test the capacity of statistical models to predict temporal changes in bird populations over a 32-year period. Using boosted regression trees, we built presence-absence and abundance models that related the presence and abundance of 132 bird species to spatial variation in climatic conditions. Presence\/absence models built using 1970\u20131974 data forecast the distributions of the majority of species in the later time period, 1998\u20132002 (mean AUC&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.79&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.01). Hindcast models performed equivalently (mean AUC&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.82&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.01). Correlations between observed and predicted abundances were also statistically significant for most species (forecast mean Spearman\u2032s \n<em>\u03c1&nbsp;<\/em>=&nbsp;0.34&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.02, hindcast&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.39&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.02). The most stringent test is to test predicted changes in geographic patterns through time. Observed changes in abundance patterns were significantly positively correlated with those predicted for 59% of species (mean Spearman\u2032s \n<em>\u03c1&nbsp;<\/em>=&nbsp;0.28&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.02, across all species). Three precipitation variables (for the wettest month, breeding season, and driest month) and minimum temperature of the coldest month were the most important predictors of bird distributions and abundances in this region, and hence of abundance changes through time. Our results suggest that models describing associations between climatic variables and abundance patterns can predict changes through time for some species, and that changes in precipitation and winter temperature appear to have already driven shifts in the geographic patterns of abundance of bird populations in western North America.","parentId":"502aaeafe4b0a8e4a0fdb1b9","contacts":[{"name":"Ill\u00e1n, Javier Guti\u00e9rrez","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Thomas, Chris D.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jones, Julia A.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Wong, Weng\u2010Keen","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Shirley, Susan M.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Betts, Matthew G.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gcb.12642\/abstract","title":"Abstract Text Link","hidden":false},{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gcb.12642\/full","title":"Full Text Link","hidden":false},{"type":"pdf","typeLabel":"PDF Download","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gcb.12642\/pdf","title":"Publication PDF","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"bird populations"},{"name":"boosted regression trees"},{"name":"climate-envelope models"},{"name":"global change"},{"name":"niche models"},{"name":"Pacific Northwest"},{"name":"species distributions"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-06","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-07-14T12:30:39.457-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-25T10:16:24.142-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Global Change Biology","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1111\/gcb.12642"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issn","value":"1365-2486"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Ill\u00e1n, Javier Guti\u00e9rrez","Thomas, Chris D.","Jones, Julia A.","Wong, Weng\u2010Keen","Shirley, Susan M.","Betts, Matthew G."],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"5006e81ae4b0abf7ce733f52":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"5006e81ae4b0abf7ce733f52","title":"Predicting Climate Change Impacts on River Ecosystems and Salmonids across the Pacific Northwest: Combining Vulnerability Modeling, Landscape Genomics, and Economic Evaluations for Conservation","body":"<div>Salmonids, a group of coldwater adapted fishes of enormous ecological and socio-economic value, historically inhabited a variety of freshwater habitats throughout the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Over the past century, however, populations have dramatically declined due to habitat loss, overharvest, and invasive species. Consequently, many populations are listed as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Complicating these stressors is global warming and associated climate change. Overall, aquatic ecosystems across the PNW are predicted to experience increasingly earlier snowmelt in the spring, reduced late spring and summer flows, increased winter flooding, warmer and drier summers, increased water temperatures, and expansion of invasive species. Understanding how effects of climate change might influence habitat for native salmonid populations is critical for effective management and recovery of these species. Scientists at the USGS and University of Montana used novel techniques and empirical data to study how climate change may drive landscape scale impacts that affect freshwater habitats and populations of key salmonid species (bull trout, cutthroat trout, and steelhead) throughout the PNW. Results showed strong linkages between climatic drivers (temperature and flow regimes) and the distribution, abundance, and genetic diversity of native salmonids across the PNW. Specifically, warming temperatures and shifting flow regimes are expected to fragment stream systems and cause salmonids to retreat upstream to headwater areas, thereby decreasing fish population abundance and genetic diversity, both of which are critical for persistence in a changing landscape. Climate-change\u2010induced periods of decreasing spring snowmelt and increases in stream temperatures are likely to decrease native biodiversity by fostering cross-breeding between invasive and native trout species. The study also developed a new framework for assessing the vulnerability of freshwater species to climate change and other stressors in complex stream networks, which will aid managers in proactively implementing conservation programs to increase resiliency and adaptive capacity of aquatic species.<\/div>\n","parentId":"5006c2c9e4b0abf7ce733f42","contacts":[{"name":"Clint C

We developed a Monte Carlo approach that accounts for uncertainty within generalized linear regression models (parameter uncertainty and residual error), uncertainty among competing models (model uncertainty), and uncertainty in future climate conditions (climate uncertainty) to produce site-specific frequency distributions of occurrence probabilities across a species\u2019 range. We illustrated the method by forecasting suitable habitat for bull trout ( \n<em>Salvelinus confluentus<\/em>) in the Interior Columbia River Basin, USA, under recent and projected 2040s and 2080s climate conditions. The 95% interval of total suitable habitat under recent conditions was estimated at 30.1 to 42.5 thousand km; this was predicted to decline to 0.5 to 7.9 thousand km by the 2080s. Projections for the 2080s showed that the great majority of stream segments would be unsuitable with high certainty, regardless of the climate dataset or bull trout model employed. The largest contributor to uncertainty in total suitable habitat was climate uncertainty, followed by parameter uncertainty and model uncertainty. Our approach makes it possible to calculate a full distribution of possible outcomes for a species, and permits ready graphical display of uncertainty for individual locations and of total habitat.","parentId":"502a9e8fe4b0a8e4a0fdb164","contacts":[{"name":"Seth J.

Many federal, state and local agencies use stream insects to monitor the health of freshwater ecosystems. While the temperature ranges for some insects are often inferred from the temperature of the waters where they were collected, this inference is coarse at best and problematic at worst. Stream temperatures fluctuate a lot during the year and temperature may or may not control where an insect lives. Field insects were collected and sent to a laboratory for testing several temperature endpoints, particularly at higher temperatures. Respiration, breathing rate, and some physical activities were expected to increase, as the insects attempt to deal with elevated temperatures and expected oxygen limitations. Previous research found that oxygen limitation results in the build-up of lactic and uric acids in tissues of insects, but this was not observed over the range of temperatures and types of insects tested for this study. While respiration, breathing rate and, physical behavior such as pumping motions were observed, it did not appear that elevated temperature alone was resulting in oxygen limitation. This was further confirmed with more experiments that looked specifically at low oxygen waters at various temperatures and included an evaluation of the insect\u2019s metabolic waste products; these warm temperature challenges did not suggest an oxygen deficit in these insects. Rather,&nbsp;the experiments suggested a more general elevated metabolic demand where the insects had to work harder to breath, eat, and molt. Further work to try and identify specific macroinvertebrate temperature tolerance values could be used by scientists and resource managers to predict aquatic resources at greatest risk to temperature change.","parentId":"502a9d8de4b0a8e4a0fdb15b","contacts":[{"name":"Robert Black","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Washington Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"David Buchwalter","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Patrick Moran","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Washington Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"temperature ranges"},{"name":"insects"},{"name":"Oxygen"},{"name":"macroinvertebrate temperature tolerance"},{"name":"vulnerability"},{"name":"aquatic resources"},{"name":"Climate change"}],"dates":[{"type":"Acquisition","dateString":"2014-10-14","label":"Acquisition"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-10-21T09:08:41.016-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-25T11:43:41.194-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Final Report","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":844955,"dateUploaded":"2014-10-21T18:38:13.000Z","name":"NWCSC_FY11_Black_FinalReport_14Oct14.docx","pathOnDisk":"__disk__8e\/78\/2c\/8e782cfcb6c2a97346a306269603a3dd372a97e8","contentType":"application\/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/544676f9e4b0f888a81b7fd1?f=__disk__8e%2F78%2F2c%2F8e782cfcb6c2a97346a306269603a3dd372a97e8"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/544676f9e4b0f888a81b7fd1","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"ProjectFinalRep.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Robert Black","David Buchwalter","Patrick Moran"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"518ba3e4e4b0037667dbc8c7":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5006f464e4b0abf7ce733f90","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Project Overview for Range-Wide Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Threatened Bull Trout","relatedTitle":"Rangewide Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Threatened Bull Trout","id":"518ba3e4e4b0037667dbc8c7","relatedId":"5006f464e4b0abf7ce733f90","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/518ba3e4e4b0037667dbc8c7","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Rangewide Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Threatened Bull Trout","relatedTitle":"Project Overview for Range-Wide Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Threatened Bull Trout","id":"5006f464e4b0abf7ce733f90","relatedId":"518ba3e4e4b0037667dbc8c7","annotation":null}]},"id":"518ba3e4e4b0037667dbc8c7","title":"Project Overview for Range-Wide Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Threatened Bull Trout","body":"This document provides an overview for the project &quot;Range-Wide Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Threatened Bull Trout&quot;.&nbsp;","parentId":"502a9e8fe4b0a8e4a0fdb164","contacts":[{"name":"Jason Dunham","oldPartyId":2751,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jdunham@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Supervisory Research Aquatic Ecologist","firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Dunham","organization":{"displayText":"Corvallis Research Group, FRESC"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":{"zip":"97331","country":"US","city":"Corvallis","state":"OR","line1":"3200 S.W.

Sagebrush and Whitebark Pine tree species the Pacific Northwest","body":"Projected current and future distributions of two tree species, Pinus albicaulis (Whitebark pine), Artemisia tridentata (Big Sagebrush), based on empirical bioclimatic models.&nbsp;Many recent changes in tree mortality, tree species distributions, and tree growth rates have been linked to changes in climate. Given that future climatic changes will likely surpass those experienced in the recent past, trees will likely face additional challenges as temperatures continue to rise and precipitation regimes shift. Managing forests in the face of climate change will require a basic understanding of which tree species will be most vulnerable to climate change and in what ways they will be vulnerable. We assessed the relative vulnerability to climate change of 11 tree species in western North America using a multivariate approach to quantify elements of sensitivity to climate change, exposure to climate change, and the capacity to adapt to climate change. Our assessment was based on a combination of expert knowledge, published studies, and projected changes in climate. The 11 species exhibited a range of vulnerabilities. Garry oak (Quercus garryana) was determined to be the most vulnerable, largely due to its relatively high sensitivity. Garry oak occupies some of the driest low woodland and savanna sites from British Columbia to California and is highly dependent on disturbances, such as periodic, low intensity fire. These low intensity and high frequency fires suppress competition and intrusion of Garry oak woodlands by conifers. Garry oak is also highly sensitive to changes in precipitation and generally only dominates dry sites. Big leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) was determined to be the least vulnerable of the 11 species, largely due to its adaptive capacity. Big leaf maple can reproduce quickly after disturbances and its seeds can disperse long distances potentially allowing it to move in response to a changing climate. Our analyses provide a framework for assessing vulnerability and for determining why some species will likely be more vulnerable than others. Such information will be critical as natural resource managers and conservation practitioners strive to address the impacts of climate change with limited funds.","purpose":"In support of the Pacific Northwest Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment (www.climatevulnerability.org) we developed a series of tree species projections for use in regional planning.

Third Generation Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM 3.1). In support of the Pacific Northwest Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment (www.climatevulnerability.org), we developed a method to model habitat suitability in which we built correlative climate suitability models for 366 terrestrial animal species at a relatively coarse spatial resolution for the entire North American continent using species range maps and 23 bioclimatic variables. We then applied the models to both current and projected future climate data downscaled to a moderately fine resolution for western North America. We refined the resulting climate suitability projections by applying a filter that limited suitability to areas in which suitable biomes were projected to be present. This map is part of a collection of projected current and future potential distributions of 366 terrestrial vertebrate species, including 12 amphibians, 237 birds, and 117 mammals, based on correlative bioclimatic models and projected changes in biomes.","purpose":"Understanding which plant and animal species will be most susceptible to future climate change is crucial for managing natural resources and public lands. The objective of this project is to compare the results of three of the different approaches that have been developed to assess the vulnerability of selected plants and animals using different future climate scenarios. This comparison includes approaches that (1) integrate expert-opinion-based assessments of climate sensitivities with projected changes in climate, (2) use numerical model projections to forecast potential climate-driven shifts in species distributions, and (3) combine measures of current climate and projected climatic changes.","parentId":"5046659ae4b0241d49d62cb0","contacts":[{"name":"Josh

States and Southwest Canada at a fine spatial resolution using a dynamic global vegetation model","body":"Future climate change may significantly alter the distributions of many plant taxa. The effects of climate change may be particularly large in mountainous regions where climate can vary significantly with elevation. Understanding potential future vegetation changes in these regions requires methods that can resolve vegetation responses to climate change at fine spatial resolutions. This research was projected using three models: cgcm31, hadley, and current. We used LPJ, a dynamic global vegetation model, to assess potential future vegetation changes for a large topographically complex area of the northwest United States and southwest Canada (38.0\u201358.0\u00b0N latitude by 136.6\u2013103.0\u00b0W longitude). LPJ is a process-based vegetation model that mechanistically simulates the effect of changing climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations on vegetation. It was developed and has been mostly applied at spatial resolutions of 10-minutes or coarser. In this study, we used LPJ at a 30-second (~1-km) spatial resolution to simulate potential vegetation changes for 2070\u20132099. LPJ was run using downscaled future climate simulations from five coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (CCSM3, CGCM3.1(T47), GISS-ER, MIROC3.2(medres), UKMO-HadCM3) produced using the A2 greenhouse gases emissions scenario. Under projected future climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the simulated vegetation changes result in the contraction of alpine, shrub-steppe, and xeric shrub vegetation across the study area and the expansion of woodland and forest vegetation. Large areas of maritime cool forest and cold forest are simulated to persist under projected future conditions. The fine spatial-scale vegetation simulations resolve patterns of vegetation change that are not visible at coarser resolutions and these fine-scale patterns are particularly important for understanding potential future vegetation changes in topographically complex areas.","purpose":"The aim of this study was to simulate vegetation responses to climate change at a fine spatial resolution across our topographically complex study area that includes vegetation ranging from xeric vegetation in the interior western United States to mesic vegetation along the Pacific Coast. LPJ, a dynamic global vegetation model, was able to accurately simulate historical vegetation for many parts of the study area when compared with both potential natural vegetation data for the United States and remotely sensed land cover data, providing confidence in the model's ability to simulate vegetation at fine spatial resolutions in topographically complex regions. The simulated future vegetation changes displayed fine spatial-scale patterns of contraction, expansion, and persistence of vegetation, all mediated by the region\u2019s topography. The results of this study improve our understanding of the potential magnitude and complexity of future vegetation changes that may occur in mountainous regions, with the caveat that many uncertainties associated with both projections of future climates and potential vegetation responses to climate change have yet to be resolved.","parentId":"5318c6bfe4b0ae6e9d5a3bb3","contacts":[{"name":"Sarah L.

Bioclimatic models were built using the Random Forest algorithm. Projected changes in vegetation were also modeled using the Random Forest algorithm but were produced by Rehfeldt et al. (2012). Projected current distribution is based on the average climate conditions for the years 1961-1990. Projected future distributions are based on average climate conditions for the years 2070-2099 using downscaled (30-second or ~1-kilometer resolution) climate projections from two Global Circulation Models: CGCM3.1 (T47) and UKMO-HadCM3. Both projections use the A2 emissions scenario and are from the CMIP3 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report) family of climate simulations. Due to changing climatic conditions, species ranges are expected to shift throughout the course of this century. Modeling subsequent shifts in suitable habitat for animal species, and the resulting changes in species assemblages, represent critical information for resource planners and managers. Developing robust suitability models for large geographic areas can be challenging, in part due to insufficient sampling data and to computational limits associated with modeling large geographies at a fine-grained spatial resolution. To overcome these challenges, I developed a method to model habitat suitability in which I built correlative climate suitability models for 366 terrestrial animal species at a relatively coarse spatial resolution for the entire North American continent using species range maps and 23 bioclimatic variables. I then applied the models to both current and projected future climate data downscaled to a moderately fine resolution for western North America. I refined the resulting climate suitability projections by applying a filter that limited suitability to areas in which suitable biomes were projected to be present. I verified my modeling results using an independent species occurrence data set, finding a median accuracy rate of 70%. I found that incorporating information about biomes into the models resulted in projections of larger climate-driven changes in suitability\u2014on average a difference of about 10%. My results also indicate that study species are more likely to see climate-driven losses than gains in habitat suitability. The percentage of study species projected to undergo a significant net decrease in habitat suitability was double the percentage projected to experience a net increase. These results highlight the shortcomings of many broad-scale models and highlight the need to take finer scale vegetation patterns into account. They also indicate that while many animal species could potentially benefit from climate-change induced increases in habitat suitability, the majority of species may suffer from substantial decreases, complicating future conservation efforts.","purpose":"Here, I combine species distribution models based on climate variables with simple biome-level habitat associations to produce models that can project future impacts on species distributions based on projected changes in climate and vegetation, with a reasonable level of accuracy. I then examine how refining the climate suitability models with these biomes associations affects the current suitability for each study species, and also compare differences in mean expansion and contraction of future species habitat suitability as simulated by two global circulation model projections and one emission scenario.","parentId":"5318c6bfe4b0ae6e9d5a3bb3","contacts":[{"name":"Josh Lawler","type":"Point of Contact","contactType":"person","email":"jlawler@uw.edu","jobTitle":"Professor","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington School of Environmental and Forest Sciences"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"+1 (206) 685-4367","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"98195","country":"USA","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","line1":"Box 352100"}}},{"name":"Meade Krosby","type":"Process Contact","contactType":"person","email":"mkrosby@uw.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington Climate Impacts Group"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"+1 206 221-2997","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"98195-5674","country":"USA","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","line1":"3737 Brooklyn Ave NE"}}},{"name":"Meade Krosby","type":"Metadata Contact","contactType":"person","email":"mkrosby@uw.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington Climate Impacts Group"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"+1 206 221-2997","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"98195-5674","country":"USA","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","line1":"3737 Brooklyn Ave NE"}}},{"name":"Jesse G.

change adaptation and mitigation require understanding of vegetation response to climate change. Using the MC2 dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) we simulate vegetation for the Northwest United States using results from 20 different Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models downscaled using the MACA algorithm. Results were generated for representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 under vegetation modeling scenarios with and without fire suppression for a total of 80 model runs for future projections. For analysis, results were aggregated by three subregions: the Western Northwest (WNW), from the crest of the Cascade Mountains west; Northwest Plains and Plateau (NWPP), the non-mountainous areas east of the Cascade Mountains; and Eastern Northwest Mountains (ENWM), the mountainous areas east of the Cascade Mountains. In the WNW, mean fire interval (MFI) averaged over all climate projections decreases by up to 48%, and potential vegetation shifts from conifer to mixed forest under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 with and without fire suppression. In the NWPP MFI averaged over all climate projections decreases by up to 82% without fire suppression and increases by up to 14% with fire suppression resulting in woodier vegetation cover. In the ENWM, MFI averaged across all climate projections decreases by up to 81%, subalpine communities are lost, but conifer forests continue to dominate the subregion in the future.","parentId":"50463e10e4b0241d49d62c35","contacts":[{"name":"Tim Sheehan","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Conservation Biology Institute"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Dominique Bachelet","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Conservation Biology Institute"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Ken Ferschweiler","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Conservation Biology Institute"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0304380015003865","title":"Sheehan et al. 2015","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Climate"},{"name":"Vegetation"},{"name":"Modeling"},{"name":"MC2"},{"name":"Fire"},{"name":"Pacific Northwest"},{"name":"CMIP5"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015-12-10","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-10-09T07:55:43.674-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-10-09T08:00:06.677-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Ecological Modelling","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Volume","value":"317"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Pages","value":"16-29"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI Number","value":"doi:10.1016\/j.ecolmodel.2015.08.023"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Tim Sheehan","Dominique Bachelet","Ken Ferschweiler"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"5543ba85e4b0a658d79416b9":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5006e8e4e4b0abf7ce733f54","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Projected past and future habitat suitability for 366 species, 1961-2099, using CGCM31 and HADCM3 climate models","relatedTitle":"Climate-Change Vulnerability in the Pacific Northwest: A Comparison of Three Approaches","id":"5543ba85e4b0a658d79416b9","relatedId":"5006e8e4e4b0abf7ce733f54","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5543ba85e4b0a658d79416b9","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Climate-Change Vulnerability in the Pacific Northwest: A Comparison of Three Approaches","relatedTitle":"Projected past and future habitat suitability for 366 species, 1961-2099, using CGCM31 and HADCM3 climate models","id":"5006e8e4e4b0abf7ce733f54","relatedId":"5543ba85e4b0a658d79416b9","annotation":null}]},"id":"5543ba85e4b0a658d79416b9","title":"Projected past and future habitat suitability for 366 species, 1961-2099, using CGCM31 and HADCM3 climate models","body":"These 1830 maps contain projected current and future change in habitat suitability for 366 species under the Third Generation Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM 3.1) and Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HADCM3).

Aspen woodlands also provide high quality forage for livestock and draw tourists to the region to view the golden vistas that form in the fall.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nHowever, aspen is currently declining across large portions of the West and it\u2019s estimated that approximately 40% of western aspen will be without suitable climate conditions within 50 years. In the northern and central Rocky Mountains, it\u2019s thought that reduced soil moisture and changing fire patterns in particular could affect the trees. Yet understanding the future of aspen in the region is currently challenged by a lack of information on how changes in fire and soil moisture interact to impact aspen growth, survival, and distribution. For example, in some places aspen may thrive following fire if soil moisture is adequate, while they may decline in areas where soil moisture is too low.<br>\n<br>\nThe goal of this work is to project the likely effects of altered moisture and fire regimes on aspen under climate change. Based on the results, researchers will develop maps of future aspen distribution in the northern and central Rocky Mountains and identify areas that could be suitable for aspen restoration. Additionally, researchers will project how climate change and aspen mortality might alter streamflow in watersheds that have large amounts of snow redistribution, in order to help small-scale irrigators adapt to future conditions. The results of this project will help land managers prioritize areas for aspen protection and restoration and proactively plan for the effects of climate change on this important species.<\/div>\n","purpose":"Aspen woodlands are both \u201cbiological hotspots\u201d and \u201ckeystone ecosystems\u201d in the western United States, meaning that loss of aspen will result in the loss of numerous other plant and animal species. Aspen is also economically and socially important, producing high quality forage for livestock and wildlife, as well as drawing tourists and improving local economies. Aspen is currently undergoing a region-wide decline, and climate-change predictions show that within 50 years approximately 40% of western aspen stands will no longer have a suitable climate. The intent of this research is to investigate the fundamental controls on aspen productivity and survivability across the central and northern Rockies, and to specifically project the likely effects of altered moisture and fire regimes on aspen under climate change. Research results will help land owners and managers to strategically mitigate for predicted climate change by evaluating new management strategies and adjusting social and economic goals in areas vulnerable to aspen loss. The project provides an avenue for information exchange among scientists, land stewards, and others with an interest in maintaining aspen woodlands across the western United States.

We propose to investigate the fundamental biophysical controls on aspen productivity and survivability in landscapes of the central and northern Rockies (CNR). Specifically, we will determine the likely effects of altered moisture and fire regimes on aspen under climate change. This will enable land managers to prioritize specific areas for protection and restoration, or to adjust management goals to proactively adapt to climate change. We will focus on the following objectives: 1) Determine how aspen productivity varies as areas transition from snow- to rain-dominated precipitation regimes; 2) Determine how post-fire aspen regeneration and productivity vary along existing winter- to summer-dominated precipitation gradients; 3) Determine how interactions between shifting patterns of water balance and fire regimes under climate change will influence future aspen distribution and productivity at landscape scales; and 4) Determine how the combination of climate and vegetation change will affect the water balance dynamics of areas currently colonized by aspen. Procedures\/Methods: The methodological approach includes the integration of a suite of ecosystem process, hydrological, and disturbance models (i.e., ISNOBAL, Biome BGC, SHAW, LANDIS-II) with field data collection and aerial photo interpretation across the CNR. The Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW), with over 50 years of climate data, will serve as a focal area and data from the watershed will be used to parameterize several of our models. A few expected products\/technology transfer opportunities that will be directly used by managers include: 1) Estimates of a soil water availability threshold for aspen that will be useful for predicting aspen vulnerability; 2) Maps indicating how aspen distribution and productivity is likely to change in future climates; 3) Identification of areas that are best suited for aspen restoration efforts; and 4) Estimated hydrologic responses of combined climate and vegetation changes in these areas. Our land management and non-profit partners have shared key management concerns and will continue to participate in project implementation, technological transfer, and outreach.

Montane wetland ecosystems are expected to be among the most sensitive to changing climate, as their persistence depends on factors directly influenced by climate (e.g. precipitation, snowpack, evaporation). Despite their importance and climate sensitivity, wetlands tend to be understudied due to a lack of tools and data relative to what is available for other ecosystem types. Here, we develop and demonstrate a new method for projecting climate-induced hydrologic changes in montane wetlands. Using observed wetland water levels and soil moisture simulated by the physically based Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model, we developed site-specific regression models relating soil moisture to observed wetland water levels to simulate the hydrologic behavior of four types of montane wetlands (ephemeral, intermediate, perennial, permanent wetlands) in the U. S. Pacific Northwest. The hybrid models captured observed wetland dynamics in many cases, though were less robust in others. We then used these models to a) hindcast historical wetland behavior in response to observed climate variability (1916\u20132010 or later) and classify wetland types, and b) project the impacts of climate change on montane wetlands using global climate model scenarios for the 2040s and 2080s (A1B emissions scenario). These future projections show that climate-induced changes to key driving variables (reduced snowpack, higher evapotranspiration, extended summer drought) will result in earlier and faster drawdown in Pacific Northwest montane wetlands, leading to systematic reductions in water levels, shortened wetland hydroperiods, and increased probability of drying. Intermediate hydroperiod wetlands are projected to experience the greatest changes. For the 2080s scenario, widespread conversion of intermediate wetlands to fast-drying ephemeral wetlands will likely reduce wetland habitat availability for many species.","parentId":"504650bde4b0241d49d62c6d","contacts":[{"name":"Se-Yeun Lee","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Maureen E.

This study provides an approach that combines genetic markers and landscape analyses to delineate populations, estimate fragmentation and connectivity in sage-grouse populations, and potentially identify underlying causes that limit connectivity and isolate populations.&nbsp;State and federal agencies are focusing current management actions for greater sage-grouse in core areas containing the highest densities of breeding birds. The core area approach permits limited resources to be applied in regions that will have the greatest potential to benefit the largest proportion of sage-grouse. As a trade-off, energy and other development then can proceed on public lands in areas outside of the core distributions, thus impacting only a small percentage of the sage-grouse in that area. This relatively simple concept of designating areas for sage-grouse conservation but permitting development in surrounding regions has the unwanted potential to fragment sagebrush habitat and increase isolation of individual sage-grouse populations. Information on gene flow and rates of genetic exchange derived from this study will be used to test the efficacy of this conservation model. The range-wide distribution of greater sage-grouse may consist primarily of a few large core populations surrounded by numerous small populations. The viability of many of these small populations may be sustained by dispersing individuals from neighboring populations. Development that causes habitat loss or creates barriers to dispersal between core areas has the potential to restrict movements important to maintain genetic diversity, augment small populations, or recolonize extirpated populations. Thus, an analysis of movement among sage-grouse populations is needed to assess levels of connectivity among core areas, and to identify and delineate features that may act as barriers to movement. Although other methods have been used regionally (radio-tracking, banding) to assess sage-grouse movement, the most efficient and informative approach uses molecular genetic techniques. Genetic methods are less costly, allow for investigations over broader spatial extents, and measure the actual breeding consequences of animal movement. In addition to defining populations and measuring connectivity, genetic approaches also address many other relevant questions including the conservation of genetic diversity, the impacts of inbreeding, and the association among landscape and geographic characteristics, habitats, and genetics.&nbsp;","parentId":"502aacabe4b0a8e4a0fdb1a6","contacts":[{"name":"Steven T.

The species is listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, but climate warming may place the species at further risk. Climate warming may lead to warming of streams in summer and increasing probability of floods in winter, leading to widespread loss of habitat projected for bull trout. This project sought to further elaborate how these climate-related threats influence bull trout across five western states (OR, WA, ID, MT, NV). These states form the southern margin of the species\u2019 range. We used predictions of temperatures in streams across approximately two-thirds of this extent to map coldwater streams or \u201cpatches\u201d suitable for spawning and early rearing of bull trout. Our results indicate that larger patches of cold water were much more likely to support the species. We also found that bull trout were more likely present in patches with extremely cold (&lt;10C or 50F) temperatures in summer (August), fewer floods in winter, and low human influences as measured by the Human Footprint index. In addition to elucidating the importance of local and climate-related threats, our work has identified dozens of places where bull trout may exist, but have not yet been detected, as well as other places where bull trout have been observed recently, but may be at high risk of local extinction. Future work will focus on completing these analyses across the range of bull trout in the conterminous United States.","parentId":"5006c1e5e4b0abf7ce733f3b","contacts":[{"name":"Jason

Despite their importance, wetland hydrology is poorly understood as few tools exist to monitor their hydrologic regime at a landscape scale. This is especially true when monitoring hydrologic change at scales below 30&nbsp;m, the resolution of one Landsat pixel. To address this, we used spectral mixture analysis (SMA) of a time series of Landsat satellite imagery to reconstruct surface-water hydrographs for 750 wetlands in Douglas County, Washington State, USA, from 1984 to 2011. SMA estimates the fractional abundance of spectra representing physically meaningful materials, known as spectral endmembers, which comprise a mixed pixel, thus providing sub-pixel estimates of surface water extent. Endmembers for water and sage steppe were selected directly from each image scene in the Landsat time series, whereas endmembers for salt and wetland vegetation were derived from a mean spectral signature of selected dates spanning the 1984\u20132011 timeframe. This method worked well (R \n<sup>2<\/sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.99) for even small wetlands (&lt;&nbsp;1800&nbsp;m \n<sup>2<\/sup>) providing a wall-to-wall dataset of reconstructed surface-water hydrographs for wetlands across our study area. We have validated this method only in semi-arid regions. Further research is necessary to extend its validity to other environments. This method can be used to better understand the role of hydrology in wetland ecosystems and as a monitoring tool to identify wetlands undergoing abnormal change.","parentId":"504650bde4b0241d49d62c6d","contacts":[{"name":"Meghan Halabisky","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"L.

Cheatgrass is highly flammable, and as it has expanded, the extent and frequency of fire in the Great Basin has increased by as much as 200%. These changes in fire regimes are associated with loss of the native sagebrush, grasses, and herbaceous flowering plants that provide habitat for many native animals, including Greater Sage-Grouse. Changes in vegetation and fire management have been suggested with the intent of conserving Greater Sage-Grouse. However, the potential responses of other sensitive-status birds to these changes in management have not been well evaluated.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nThis project will examine current and future interactions among cheatgrass density, precipitation, and fire across the Great Basin. Growth of cheatgrass is much more responsive than many native plants to variation in precipitation, especially during winter and spring. The project also will model current and future cover of sagebrush and native grasses and forbs, and explore how projected changes in fire patterns and vegetation and fire management may affect sensitive-status breeding birds. The results of this project may inform decisions about management of vegetation, fuels, and habitat for Greater Sage-Grouse.<br>\n<br>\nThis project is also supported by the Joint Fire Science Program.<\/div>\n","purpose":"As the distribution and abundance of non-native cheatgrass ( Bromus tectorum) in the Great Basin has increased, the extent and frequency of fire in the region has increased by as much as 200%.

Changes in fire regimes, fuels treatments, and post-fire restoration have been suggested with the intent of increasing the probability of sage-grouse persistence. However, the potential responses of other sensitive-status birds to these interventions have not been assessed rigorously. We will model current and future (to 2050) spatial interactions among cheatgrass cover and biomass, precipitation, and fire across the Great Basin and model current and future cover of sagebrush and herbaceous vegetation. For tractability, our analyses of percent cover of sagebrush and herbaceous vegetation, and of the habitat quality and occupancy of sensitive-status birds, will focus on three areas: the eastern Owyhee uplands (Idaho, Oregon, and Nevada), Bodie Hills-Pine Nut Mountains (California and Nevada), and east-central Great Basin (Nevada and Utah), each corresponding to the area covered by one Landsat scene (~185 x 185 km). These three areas span both biogeographic gradients and gradients of isolation and resilience of sage grouse. We further will examine how projected changes in fire regimes and fire and fuels treatments may affect habitat quality for and probability of occupancy of sensitive-status breeding birds. Additionally, we will use statistical change-point analyses to detect any abrupt, nonlinear temporal changes-thresholds-in projected vegetation cover, habitat quality, and occupancy. Detection of ecological thresholds, if they exist, may suggest fuels treatments and restoration actions that will decrease the probability of entering into or remaining within undesirable ecological states.","parentId":"55130c4fe4b02e76d75c0755","linkParentIds":["55130c96e4b02e76d75c075e"],"contacts":[{"name":"Erica Fleishman","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"efleishman@ucdavis.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Erica","lastName":"Fleishman","organization":{"displayText":"University of California, Davis"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jennifer Balch","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Colorado, Boulder"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Bethany Bradley","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","jobTitle":"Assistant Professor","firstName":"Bethany","lastName":"Bradley","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"Bethany Bradley\/UMASS -

Managing forests in the face of climate change will require a basic understanding of which tree species will be most vulnerable to climate change and in what ways they will be vulnerable. We assessed the relative vulnerability to climate change of 11 tree species in western North America using a multivariate approach to quantify elements of sensitivity to climate change, exposure to climate change, and the capacity to adapt to climate change. Our assessment was based on a combination of expert knowledge, published studies, and projected changes in climate. Of the 11 species, Garry oak ( \n<em>Quercus garryana<\/em>) was determined to be the most vulnerable, largely because of its relatively high sensitivity. Garry oak occupies some of the driest low woodland and savanna sites from British Columbia to California and is highly dependent on disturbances, such as periodic, low intensity fire. Big leaf maple ( \n<em>Acer macrophyllum<\/em>) was determined to be the least vulnerable, largely because of its adaptive capacity. Big leaf maple can reproduce quickly after disturbances and its seeds can disperse long distances potentially allowing it to move in response to a changing climate. Our analyses provide a framework for assessing vulnerability and for determining why some species will likely be more vulnerable than others. Such information will be critical as natural resource managers and conservation practitioners strive to address the impacts of climate change with limited funds.","parentId":"5046659ee4b0241d49d62cb2","contacts":[{"name":"Springer Netherlands","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Michael J.

Those within TransitionSummary are summarized in the same manner, but contain summaries of area affected by each Transition Type. The csv files within HabitatSummary are designed to be joined ot the grid mentioned above, to allow for a spatial depiction of habitat projections.

Sample queries outlining how to build new summaries of output data for mapping from the ClassesSummary files and lookup tables are included in the database: SEO_Summaries.accdb Due to a minor error in starting conditions, summaries of sage-grouse habitat may be underestimated in the early years, especially within the northwestern quadrant of the map. Because of this, we have removed the summaries of the first four years within the Habitat summary files, and constrain the sample queries to only show projections for after 2011. If the early years of this summary data are needed for viewing other parts of the map, they can be constructed by removing a constraint within query1 of the sample queries shown above.","purpose":"Balancing socio-economic and ecological demands on forests is an ongoing challenge and may be further complicated by future changes in climate. Land managers need information on the potential effects of climate change for future management planning that considers the diversity of valuable natural resources (forest products, clean water, wildfire control, etc.) that are linked to vegetation. The objectives of this project are to explore how climate and land management in southwestern Oregon and coastal Washington might interact to shape future vegetation and wildlife habitat, and determine what management actions will likely maximize habitats for key species. Through computer simulations that are run under a range of future management and climate scenarios, this project will build upon a body of knowledge that can help inform management planning for a changing future, raising the likelihood that ecosystems can be sustained for both humans and wildlife.","parentId":"55358e86e4b0b22a158079c7","contacts":[{"name":"Institute for Natural Resources","type":"Point of Contact","email":"emilie.henderson@oregonstate.edu","primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"541-737-9918","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"97207","country":"USA","city":"Corvallis","state":"OR","line2":"Oregon State University","line1":"PO Box 751"}}},{"name":"Emilie Henderson","type":"Metadata Contact","email":"emilie.henderson@oregonstate.edu","organization":{"displayText":"Institute for Natural Resources, Oregon State University"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"541-737-9918","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"97207","country":"USA","city":"Corvallis","state":"OR","line2":"Oregon State University","line1":"PO Box 751"}}},{"name":"Emilie Henderson","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Megan Creutzberg","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jessica Halofsky","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Institute for Natural Resources, Oregon State University","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Data"],"tags":[{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"climate change"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"land management"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"state and transition modeling"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"vegetation change"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"vulnerability assessment"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"wildlife habitat"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Pacific Northwest"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Southeast Oregon"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Great Basin"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015-04-22","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"Start","dateString":"2007","label":""},{"type":"End","dateString":"2096","label":""},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-04-22T18:10:10.093-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-22T18:10:10.093-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":true,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":10739,"dateUploaded":"2015-04-23T00:10:01.000Z","name":"southeastOregon_results_metadata.xml","pathOnDisk":"__disk__18\/04\/20\/18042000a154887624294c32421ea011e860b896","title":"","contentType":"application\/fgdc+xml","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55383862e4b02c4db8d20ab5?f=__disk__18%2F04%2F20%2F18042000a154887624294c32421ea011e860b896"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55383862e4b02c4db8d20ab5","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"Resultsfiles_So.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46"},"56181a67e4b0cdb063e3fd9c":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5006e94ee4b0abf7ce733f56","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"RHESSys model output, central Oregon Cascades, 2014","relatedTitle":"Climate Change and Peak Flows: Knowledge-to-Action to Help Managers Address Impacts on Streamflow Dynamics and Aquatic Habitat","id":"56181a67e4b0cdb063e3fd9c","relatedId":"5006e94ee4b0abf7ce733f56","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/56181a67e4b0cdb063e3fd9c","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Climate Change and Peak Flows: Knowledge-to-Action to Help Managers Address Impacts on Streamflow Dynamics and Aquatic Habitat","relatedTitle":"RHESSys model output, central Oregon Cascades, 2014","id":"5006e94ee4b0abf7ce733f56","relatedId":"56181a67e4b0cdb063e3fd9c","annotation":null}]},"id":"56181a67e4b0cdb063e3fd9c","title":"RHESSys model output, central Oregon Cascades, 2014","body":"Daily observed (historical) and RHESSys simulated streamflow under three climate change scenarios for eight Oregon watersheds.

It also will bring new sets of impacts and stressors, posing additional threats to ecological systems.&nbsp;Recognizing these challenges, both the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) have been leading a multi-faceted effort to address climate change in its mission to safeguard the state\u2019s wildlife and natural habitats for current and future generations.&nbsp;This report is intended to serve as a case study for ways in which state agencies and non-governmental organizations can work together to forward meaningful climate change adaptation strategies, and it highlights several of WDFW and NWF\u2019s collective efforts to date, including the successes, lessons learned, and opportunities for moving forward","parentId":"5046659ee4b0241d49d62cb2","contacts":[{"name":"Patty Glick","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"National Wildlife Federation"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Lynn Helbrecht","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Josh Lawler","oldPartyId":63272,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"jlawler@u.washington.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Josh","lastName":"Lawler","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Michael Case","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"https:\/\/www.nwf.org\/pdf\/Adaptation-Reports\/Safeguarding%20Washingtons%20FWFINAL091113.pdf","title":"Glick et al. 2013","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Collaboration"},{"name":"Fish"},{"name":"Mammals"},{"name":"Adaptation"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-10-16T08:22:34.722-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-02-26T09:48:44.332-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"National Wildlife Federation Publication","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Patty Glick","Lynn Helbrecht","Josh Lawler","Michael Case"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"5006eb3ee4b0abf7ce733f5a":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"5006eb3ee4b0abf7ce733f5a","title":"Sagebrush Ecosystems in a Changing Climate","body":"<p>Climate responses of sagebrush are needed to inform land managers of the stability and restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, which are an important but threatened&nbsp;habitat type. We evaluated climate responses of sagebrush using two approaches: (1) experimental manipulations of temperature and precipitation for natural plants in the field, and (2)&nbsp;assessment of how climate adaptation and weather have affected sagebrush seeding efforts on nearly 25 large-scale sagebrush seeding projects done over the past several decades. Experimental warming increased growth of sagebrush in high-elevation meadows in the Teton Mountains, but had marginal or no effect&nbsp;at lower elevations sites (near Twin Falls and Boise, Idaho, respectively). Increased precipitation enhanced sagebrush abundance, along with&nbsp;flowering and stem growth, particularly&nbsp;when added in winter on deep soils. In the post-fire seeding study, we found sagebrush abundances to be highly variable across different seeding projects, and the variation was partly related to the climate of seeding and seed-source sites&nbsp;and weather. Sagebrush seeds typically traveled hundreds of kilometers and nearly&nbsp;1000 m downhill from seed source\/origins to seeding sites, from sites with colder minimum temperatures than the seeding sites. Big sagebrush is comprised of subspecies that differ in their climate adaptation, and many seeding projects received a subspecies that differed from the native type requested by&nbsp;the land managers. These climate transfers appeared important to the success of seedings: successful seedings imported seeds from sites having the same minimum temperatures. In failed &nbsp;seedings, seeds originated from relatively colder sites and, moreover, years with relatively warm minimum temperatures prevailed following planting. These results suggest minimum &nbsp;temperature and winter precipitation responses are important factors in the climate adaptation and ecology of this desert shrub, and their consideration in climate vulnerability analyses and selection of seed sources is likely to improve land planning and restoration.&nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"5006c2c9e4b0abf7ce733f42","contacts":[{"name":"Matthew J Germino","oldPartyId":24409,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"mgermino@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey, Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"208-426-3353","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"David S Pilliod","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center (FRESC)"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Keith Reinhardt","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Idaho State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Diane Debinski","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Iowa State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","oldPartyId":59609,"type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"sagebrush"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"restoration"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"conservation"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"climate change"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"vulnerability assessment"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Location","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Location","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Northwest CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2012"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2012-06-01","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2014-08-30","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2012-07-18T10:58:38.475-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-03-16T08:37:52.211-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"Completed","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"FY12 COA","value":"C1591"},{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"FY13 COA","value":"CM0005"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Expando","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ExpandoFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":116000,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2012","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":58000},{"year":"2013","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":58000}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":424,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":19900,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2016-03-15T21:04:44.000Z","name":"NW-2012-10_SageBrush_JohnMosesso_USGS.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__5d\/85\/3e\/5d853e36aeaaa436b77c4b68b62b71ca258ad12a","title":"Sagebrush -

Preliminary and published insights on climate responses of sagebrush and implications for vulnerability assessments and post-fire restoration were described. Responses of big sagebrush and competitors such as cheatgrass to climate manipulations are providing important insight on the ways in which sagebrush may resist or respond to warming or shifts in precipitation. Big sagebrush is a remarkably diverse species, and preliminary findings from common-garden studies are suggesting how the diversity is important for its climate responses and for selection of appropriate seed sources. Restoration success is largely a problem of initial seedling establishment, aside from post-restoration management and disturbance, and new studies are revealing how seedlings of different seed sources respond to climate and management treatments of herbs.","parentId":"504665d5e4b0241d49d62cc1","contacts":[{"name":"Matt Germino","type":"Participant","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/greatnorthernlcc.org\/event\/496","title":"Webinar","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"sagebrush"},{"name":"climate"},{"name":"wildfire"},{"name":"invasives"},{"name":"restoration"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-01-24","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-02-21T08:57:14.824-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-03-16T08:44:55.501-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Webinar","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Matt Germino"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"53175c10e4b0cd4cd83c5def":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5006eb9de4b0abf7ce733f5c","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Seasonal Climate Variability and Change in the Pacific Northwest of the United States","relatedTitle":"Integrated Scenarios of Climate, Hydrology, and Vegetation for the Northwest (Funded Jointly by the Northwest CSC and NOAA\u2019s Climate Impacts Research Consortium)","id":"53175c10e4b0cd4cd83c5def","relatedId":"5006eb9de4b0abf7ce733f5c","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/53175c10e4b0cd4cd83c5def","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Integrated Scenarios of Climate, Hydrology, and Vegetation for the Northwest (Funded Jointly by the Northwest CSC and NOAA\u2019s Climate Impacts Research Consortium)","relatedTitle":"Seasonal Climate Variability and Change in the Pacific Northwest of the United States","id":"5006eb9de4b0abf7ce733f5c","relatedId":"53175c10e4b0cd4cd83c5def","annotation":null}]},"id":"53175c10e4b0cd4cd83c5def","title":"Seasonal Climate Variability and Change in the Pacific Northwest of the United States","body":"Abstract:&nbsp;Observed changes in climate of the U.S. Pacific Northwest since the early twentieth century were examined using four different datasets. Annual mean temperature increased by approximately 0.6&deg;\u20130.8&deg;C from 1901 to 2012, with corroborating indicators including a lengthened freeze-free season, increased temperature of the coldest night of the year, and increased growing-season potential evapotranspiration. Seasonal temperature trends over shorter time scales (&lt;50 yr) were variable. Despite increased warming rates in most seasons over the last half century, nonsignificant cooling was observed during spring from 1980 to 2012. Observations show a long-term increase in spring precipitation; however, decreased summer and autumn precipitation and increased potential evapotranspiration have resulted in larger climatic water deficits over the past four decades. A bootstrapped multiple linear regression model was used to better resolve the temporal heterogeneity of seasonal temperature and precipitation trends and to apportion trends to internal climate variability, solar variability, volcanic aerosols, and anthropogenic forcing. The El Ni&ntilde;o\u2013Southern Oscillation and the Pacific\u2013North American pattern were the primary modulators of seasonal temperature trends on multidecadal time scales: solar and volcanic forcing were nonsignificant predictors and contributed weakly to observed trends. Anthropogenic forcing was a significant predictor of, and the leading contributor to, long-term warming; natural factors alone fail to explain the observed warming. Conversely, poor model skill for seasonal precipitation suggests that other factors need to be considered to understand the sources of seasonal precipitation trends.","parentId":"50463e10e4b0241d49d62c35","contacts":[{"name":"John T.

Ideally, a subset would have simulations that both (1) appropriately represent the range of possible futures for the variable\/s most important to the impact under investigation and (2) come from global climate models (GCMs) that provide plausible results for future climate in the region of interest. We demonstrate an approach to select a subset of GCMs that incorporates both concepts and provides insights into the range of climate impacts. To represent how an ecosystem process responds to projected future changes, we methodically sample, using a simple sensitivity analysis, how an ecosystem variable responds locally to projected regional temperature and precipitation changes. We illustrate our approach in the Pacific Northwest, focusing on (a) changes in streamflow magnitudes in critical seasons for water management and (b) changes in annual vegetation carbon.","parentId":"50463e10e4b0241d49d62c35","contacts":[{"name":"Northwest Climate Science Center","oldPartyId":59609,"type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","active":true,"aliases":["Northwest CSC","NWCSC","NCCWSC NW (CSC)"],"fbmsCodes":["GGHCEN0503","GGHCGR0503"],"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"Northwest Climate Science Center - Location","mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Julie A.

(1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Bandon marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2010 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

used WARMER, a 1-D cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al. 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Bandon marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2070 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

(1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;This raster contains data from Bull Island marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2010 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

2070-2110","body":"We used WARMER, a 1-D cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al. 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;This raster contains data from Bull Island marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2070 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Grays Harbor marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2010 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

2070-2110","body":"We used WARMER, a 1-D cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al. 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.This raster contains data from Grays Harbor marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2070 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

(1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;This raster contains data from Nisqually marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2010 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

2070-2110","body":"We used WARMER, a 1-D cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al. 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;This raster contains data from Nisqually marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2070 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

(1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;This raster contains data from Padilla marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2010 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

2070-2110","body":"We used WARMER, a 1-D cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al. 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;This raster contains data from Padilla marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2070 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

(1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;This raster contains data from Port Susan marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2010 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

2070-2110","body":"We used WARMER, a 1-D cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al. 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;This raster contains data from Port Susan marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2070 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

used WARMER, a 1-D cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al. 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;This raster contains data from Siletz marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2010 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research Center","type":"Point of

used WARMER, a 1-D cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al. 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;This raster contains data from Siletz marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2070 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;This raster contains data from Skokomish marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2010 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

2070-2110","body":"We used WARMER, a 1-D cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al. 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;This raster contains data from Skokomish marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2070 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

2010-2060","body":"We used WARMER, a 1-D cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al. 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;This raster contains data from Willapa marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2010 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

2070-2110","body":"We used WARMER, a 1-D cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al. 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above. In WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Cs dating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms, at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1. We used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)\/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.&nbsp;This raster contains data from Willapa marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2070 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","contacts":[{"name":"US Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field

University of Idaho Experimental Forest (UIEF) near Moscow, ID, 30-minute snow depth and meteorological data were collected at seven locations across the Lawler Landing site (elevation 880 m) from February to May of WY 2008. &nbsp;A 70 m north-south oriented transect of 5 snow depth sensors was deployed to record sub-daily snow depth, with co-located meteorological instruments. The sensors traversed a 40 m long elliptical forest gap and the adjacent forest in both directions. The locations were the same as those used previously to quantify how shortwave and longwave radiation vary across a forest gap [Lawler and Link, 2011]. Two additional snow depth sensors and meteorological stations were deployed at \u201cinterior forest reference\u201d and \u201copen reference\u201d sites, situated 80 m southeast and 1200 m west, respectively, from the main transect. Whereas the forest reference site was similar to the surrounding forest, the open reference site was much more exposed than the forest gap. &nbsp;These data are generally raw datalogger output and have not been quality controlled in any way unless specifically designated in the variable name. &nbsp;See manufacturer specifications for individual instruments to determine sensor accuracy. &nbsp;This file was compiled from individual raw data files provided by IU, along with approximate coordinates of the sensor locations.

However, if forests can be managed to retain snow longer, some of these environmental and financial impacts may be mitigated. Recent results from our research team demonstrate that in areas with relatively warm winters, strategically-cut forest gaps could offset climatic warming by increasing snow retention on the landscape and delaying runoff. However, in areas with colder winters, the opposite is true, as snow lasts longer under the forest canopy. We will map these climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect snow duration in different locations and testing those predictions against careful observations from our field sites and a network of citizen scientists. Working with regional forest and water managers, we will identify strategies for applying these findings to decision-making, linking climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management. Results from this project will help managers to act strategically to maximize snow retention (protecting forests in some areas while opening gaps in others), providing more water later in the season for hydropower, agriculture, and fish flows.","parentId":"541b07bee4b01571b3d654fc","contacts":[{"name":"Timothy Link","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"tlink@uidaho.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"Link","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Susan E.

At Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (BOP NCA), a warming frame and control plot pair were established at five locations along a 4 km distance at 3000\u2019 ASL on loam soils with a mosaic of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), Sandberg\u2019s bluegrass (Poa secunda), and biotic soil crusts. This area is relatively disturbed and has high abundances of exotic annual grasses or naturalized restoration grasses. Plot sizes were 2.4 x 2.4 m and were installed in fall 2012. At 4800\u2019 ASL on rocky loam soils in Hollister, five frames were arrayed with paired control plots across a 2 km transect at 4900\u2019 ASL in a Wyoming Big Sagebrush and squirreltail (Elymus elymoides) and P. secunda community, starting in fall 2010 using 2.4 x 1.2 m frames. At Grand Teton National Park (GTNP), on cobbly alluvium soils in the Pilgrim Creek basin, we established 3 control and 3 warmed frames in an approximately one acre area having low (little) sagebrush (A. arbuscula ssp. thermopola) and a high abundance of native forbs and scarce grasses such arrowleaf (Balsamorhiza) and buckwheat (Eriogonum), in May 2010. The Teton site is pristine and was not fenced, but all other sites had 1.5 m tall barbed wire fences to exclude livestock and the BOP sites additionally had chicken wire fencing to exclude small mammals.

for the life history of many fish species, and understanding of the patterns of movement is central to managing populations, communities, and the landscapes they use. We combined passive integrated transponder tagging over 4 years and strontium isotopes in otoliths to demonstrate that 25% of the mountain whitefish (\n<em>Prosopium williamsoni<\/em>) sampled moved between the Methow and Columbia rivers, Washington, USA. Seasonal migrations downstream from the Methow River to the Columbia River to overwinter occurred in autumn and upstream movements in the spring. We observed migration was common during the first year of life, with migrants being larger than nonmigrants. However, growth between migrants and nonmigrants was similar. Water temperature was positively related to the proportion of migrants and negatively related to the timing of migration, but neither was related to discharge. The broad spatio-temporal movements we observed suggest mountain whitefish, and likely other nonanadromous fish, require distant habitats and also suggests that management and conservation strategies to keep connectivity of large river networks are imperative.","parentId":"502aa960e4b0a8e4a0fdb18a","contacts":[{"name":"Joseph R Benjamin","oldPartyId":23979,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"jbenjamin@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Ecologist","firstName":"Joseph","middleName":"R","lastName":"Benjamin","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Corvallis Research Group, FRESC"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"2084265230","streetAddress":{"zip":"83706","country":"US","city":"Boise","state":"ID","line1":"970 Lusk Street"},"buildingCode":"WID","name":"Joseph R Benjamin\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

Remote-sensing technology offers great potential for predicting species distributions at large scales, but the cost and required expertise are prohibitive for many applications. We test the usefulness of freely available raw remote-sensing reflectance data in predicting species distributions of 40 commonly occurring bird species in western Oregon.<\/p> \n <\/div> \n<\/div> \n<div> \n <h4>Location<\/h4> \n <div> \n  <p>Central Coast Range, Cascade and Klamath Mountains Oregon, USA.<\/p> \n <\/div> \n<\/div> \n<div> \n <h4>Methods<\/h4> \n <div> \n  <p>Information on bird observations was collected from 4598 fixed-radius point counts. Reflectance data were obtained using 30-m resolution Landsat imagery summarized at scales of 150, 500, 1000 and 2000&nbsp;m. We used boosted regression tree (BRT) models to analyse relationships between distributions of birds and reflectance values and evaluated prediction performance of the models using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values.<\/p> \n <\/div> \n<\/div> \n<div> \n <h4>Results<\/h4> \n <div> \n  <p>Prediction success of models using all reflectance values was high (mean AUC&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.79&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.10 SD). Further, model performance using individual reflectance bands exceeded those that used only Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The relative influence of band 4 predictors was highest, indicating the importance of variables associated with vegetation biomass and photosynthetic activity. Across spatial scales, the average influence of predictors at the 2000&nbsp;m scale was greatest.<\/p> \n <\/div> \n<\/div> \n<div> \n <h4>Main Conclusions<\/h4> \n <div> \n  <p>We demonstrate that unclassified remote-sensing imagery can be used to produce species distribution models with high prediction success. Our study is the first to identify general patterns in the usefulness of spectral reflectances for species distribution modelling of multiple species. We conclude that raw Landsat Thematic Mapper data will be particularly useful in species distribution models when high-resolution predictions are required, including habitat change detection studies, identification of fine-scale biodiversity hotspots and reserve design.<\/p> \n <\/div> \n<\/div>","parentId":"502aaeafe4b0a8e4a0fdb1b9","contacts":[{"name":"S M Shirley","type":"Author","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Z Yang","type":"Author","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"R H Hutchinson","type":"Author","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"J D Alexander","type":"Author","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"K MCGarigal","type":"Author","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"M G Betts","type":"Author","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ddi.12093\/abstract","title":"Wiley Online Library","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"boosted regression trees"},{"name":"land-cover"},{"name":"model validation"},{"name":"species distribution modeling"},{"name":"unclassified remote-sensing imagery"},{"name":"Western Oregon"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013-07","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-07-24T15:05:02.865-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-25T12:59:13.991-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Diversity and Distributions","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI Number","value":"10.1111\/ddi.12093"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Volume","value":"19"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Issue ","value":"7"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Pages","value":"855-866"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["S M Shirley","Z Yang","R H Hutchinson","J D Alexander","K MCGarigal","M G Betts"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"56339371e4b048076347ef7d":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/54186668e4b09adda0ad1ce2","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Sqigwts 3-D Landscape","relatedTitle":"Collecting and Applying Schitsu\u2019umsh Indigenous Knowledge and Practices to Climate Change Decision Making","id":"56339371e4b048076347ef7d","relatedId":"54186668e4b09adda0ad1ce2","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/56339371e4b048076347ef7d","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Collecting and Applying Schitsu\u2019umsh Indigenous Knowledge and Practices to Climate Change Decision Making","relatedTitle":"Sqigwts 3-D Landscape","id":"54186668e4b09adda0ad1ce2","relatedId":"56339371e4b048076347ef7d","annotation":null}]},"id":"56339371e4b048076347ef7d","title":"Sqigwts 3-D Landscape","body":"The Sqigwts 3-D Landscape is an interactive three-dimensional experience developed to provide an opportunity to effectively learn about the important cultural significance of sqigwts, the water potato (Sagittaria latifolia), to the Schitsu\u2019umsh or Coeur d\u2019Alene Indian Tribe (of the Pacific Northwest USA). The goal is to provide information on the potential vulnerability of this species to climate change and of the Schitsu\u2019umsh living relationship with it. Schitsu\u2019umsh knowledge and practice is called hnkhwelkhwlnet, meaning \u201cour ways of life in the world,\u201d and is conveyed through acts of re-telling oral traditions and stories. For the Schitsu\u2019umsh, storytelling is a living act and can only truly occur in-person as a shared experience between the storyteller and listeners as active participants. While a simulation of this active in-person exchange, this 3-D Landscape provides a storytelling experience that attempts to replicate how hnkhwelkhwlnet can be accessed and understood. This format more effectively expresses indigenous meaning than a literacy-based format. Conveyed in the 3-D Landscape are insights into this unique indigenous form of knowledge and practice and how it has provided a means for Schitsu\u2019umsh to successfully adapt to various forms of environmental and social change. Schitsu\u2019umsh hnkhwelkhwlnet offers insights into how the indigenous and the scientific, in concert with each other, can be applied to address climate change. In offering this 3-D Landscape to the public, the Schitsu\u2019umsh invite you to participate in this story, interact with its content, and see for yourself what mi\u2019yp, or lessons, about their hnkhwelkhwlnet are revealed to you. The Sqigwts 3-D Landscape was developed under a project funded by the US Geological Survey (USGS) entitled \"Schitsu'umsh Relationships with Their Dynamic Landscapes: Identifying, Managing, and Applying Indigenous Knowledge and Praxis,\" with co-PIs from the Schitsu'umsh Tribe and from the University of Idaho. All final materials developed for this project, both intellectual property and traditional knowledge, were reviewed by the Tribal Council and related Committees, and approved for public dissemination.

The variables available include minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation. These downscaling outputs are based on Global Climate Model (GCM) projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and historical daily gridded climate data for Canada.\u200b\u200b Statistical properties and spatial patterns of the downscaled scenarios are based on this gridded observational dataset, which represents one approximation of the actual historical climate. Gridded values may differ from climate stations and biases may be present at high elevations or in areas with low station density. Projected change from historical (1950-2005) in several indices of climate extremes under three Global Circulation Models (CanESM2, CNRM-CM5, and CCSM4) for two time periods (2050s and 2080s) for one

Final Report (Contribution of Landscape...Greater Sage-Grouse)","body":"Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act because of population and habitat fragmentation coupled with inadequate regulatory mechanisms to control development in critical areas. In addition to the current threats to habitat, each 1 degree celsius increase due to climate change is expected to result in an additional 87,000 km2 of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) that will be converted to unsuitable habitat for sage-grouse. Thus, the future distribution and composition of sagebrush landscapes is likely to differ greatly from today\u2019s configuration. We conducted a large, multi-objective project to identify: (1) characteristics of habitats required by sage-grouse, (2) spatial organization of breeding populations of sage-grouse across their entire range, (3) current and future distribution of sagebrush landscapes, and (4) connectivity of habitat and sage-grouse populations. Ultimately, the project will provide an understanding of sage-grouse response to spatial and temporal changes in their environment. This information will permit managers to estimate population vulnerability to stochastic or environmental risks and will aid decisions about allocating limited resources for conservation.\n<br> \n<br> Spatial organization of breeding populations (Objective 2) can best be delineated from genetic data. Funding from the NW Climate Science Center (NW CSC) was used to develop a peer-reviewed study plan (Attachment 3) that develops the scientific foundation for the range-wide genetic connectivity study. Funding from the NW CSC was also used to process genetic data in a preliminary sample of sage-grouse feathers collected in the northwest portion of the sage-grouse range. Funding from other federal and state agencies supported additional genetic analyses, development of landscape models delineating cost-surfaces, and assessment of features that influence genetic relatedness among sage-grouse populations.&nbsp;","parentId":"502aacabe4b0a8e4a0fdb1a6","contacts":[{"name":"Steven T Knick","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey, Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Sara J Oyler-McCance","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey Fort Collins Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Greater Sage-Grouse"},{"name":"Centrocercus urophasianus"},{"name":"Endangered Species Act"},{"name":"climate change"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013-11-01","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-11-05T08:11:50.108-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-03-16T09:56:54.530-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Report","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"processed":false,"size":2373486,"dateUploaded":"2013-11-05T08:11:12.000Z","name":"NWCSC_FY11_Knick_FinalReport_01Nov2013.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__34\/6e\/5e\/346e5ed953510a75bc7c808105c987c596a60cc3","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/52790ab6e4b0c04ac3417ad5?f=__disk__34%2F6e%2F5e%2F346e5ed953510a75bc7c808105c987c596a60cc3"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/52790ab6e4b0c04ac3417ad5","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"StevenKnickFina.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Steven T Knick","Sara J Oyler-McCance"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]},"5617fd99e4b0cdb063e3fc87":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5006e94ee4b0abf7ce733f56","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Stream Gage Data, 2014","relatedTitle":"Climate Change and Peak Flows: Knowledge-to-Action to Help Managers Address Impacts on Streamflow Dynamics and Aquatic Habitat","id":"5617fd99e4b0cdb063e3fc87","relatedId":"5006e94ee4b0abf7ce733f56","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5617fd99e4b0cdb063e3fc87","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Climate Change and Peak Flows: Knowledge-to-Action to Help Managers Address Impacts on Streamflow Dynamics and Aquatic Habitat","relatedTitle":"Stream Gage Data, 2014","id":"5006e94ee4b0abf7ce733f56","relatedId":"5617fd99e4b0cdb063e3fc87","annotation":null}]},"id":"5617fd99e4b0cdb063e3fc87","title":"Stream Gage Data, 2014","body":"The following spreadsheets contain pressure and temperature recorded by the barologgers (atmospheric measure) and leveloggers (stream measure) at each stream gauge.

We used predictions of temperatures in streams across approximately two-thirds of the species' range in the U.S. to map coldwater streams or \u201cpatches\u201d suitable for spawning and early rearing of Bull Trout. Each patch consists of streams with contiguous reaches of cold water. Patches were delineated using medium resolution National Hydrography Dataset streams containing modeled temperatures available at 1 km intervals, as provided by the NorWeST project (http:\/\/www.fs.fed.us\/rm\/boise\/AWAE\/projects\/NorWeST.html).Once the patches were delineated, various watershed metrics were generated for each patch to provide covariates for occupancy models that were used to estimate the probability of presence of Bull Trout. Watershed metrics included climatic and\/or local factors hypothesized to influence Bull Trout, such as patch size, connectivity to other patches, migratory habitat size, brook trout presence, lake trout presence, human influence, road density, prevalence of very cold water, winter high flow events, and wildfire.","purpose":"Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus) is one of the most cold-adapted species in freshwater in North America. The species is listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act throughout its range within the conterminous United States, which encompasses a vast geography, including major river systems such as the Klamath and Columbia Rivers, and a host of Pacific coastal rivers in Washington State, as well as river systems originating east of the continental divide in northern Montana and ultimately draining to the Atlantic Ocean.Our fundamental objective in this project is to evaluate climate-related and local threats to Bull Trout and to provide an objective and unified framework for evaluating them together across the species\u2019 range within the conterminous United States. To this end, we have 1) developed and applied methods for delineating and mapping discrete patches of habitat that support spawning and early rearing of Bull Trout, 2) attributed these patches with covariates indicating climate-related and local threats to Bull Trout, and 3) developed models to relate these covariates to presence of Bull Trout to identify the most important factors influencing presence, and to quantify spatial variation in their influences. This GIS dataset represents parts 1 and 2 of this effort.","parentId":"502a9e87e4b0a8e4a0fdb162","contacts":[{"name":"USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center","type":"Point of Contact","email":"fresc_outreach@usgs.gov","primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"541-750-1030","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"97330","country":"USA","city":"Corvallis","state":"OR","line2":"Suite 400","line1":"777 NW 9th Street"}}},{"name":"USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center","type":"Distributor","email":"fresc_outreach@usgs.gov","primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"541-750-1030","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"97330","country":"USA","city":"Corvallis","state":"OR","line2":"Suite 400","line1":"777 NW 9th Street"}}},{"name":"David Hockman-Wert","type":"Metadata Contact","email":"dhockman-wert@usgs.gov","jobTitle":"Biologist","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey, NORTHWEST REGION"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"541-750-0944","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"97333","country":"USA","city":"Corvallis","state":"OR","line1":"3200 SW Jefferson Way"}}},{"name":"David Hockman-Wert","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jason Dunham","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Nathan Chelgren","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Michael Heck","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey, Forest & Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Data"],"browseTypes":["Shapefile","Downloadable","Map Service","OGC WMS Layer","OGC WFS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Downloadable","Mappable"],"tags":[{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"Stream temperature"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"Bull trout"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"Climate change"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"Vulnerability assessment"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"Salvelinus confluentus"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"Habitat patches"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Pacific Northwest"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Idaho"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Montana"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Washington"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Oregon"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Columbia River"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Snake River"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Salmon River"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Clearwater River"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Clark Fork River"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Kootenai River"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-10-22","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"Start","dateString":"1984","label":""},{"type":"End","dateString":"2014","label":""},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-10-23T12:18:45.679-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-02-17T14:43:19.464-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"boundingBox":{"minY":41.069692112121,"minX":-122.92569279764,"maxY":49.040051533465,"maxX":-112.24380101577},"facetName":"Shapefile","name":"BT_CSC_NHD_1kmDataModel_Patches_Dissolve_Merge","files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":11886652,"dateUploaded":"2014-10-23T18:12:22.000Z","name":"BT_CSC_NHD_1kmDataModel_Patches_Dissolve_Merge.shp","pathOnDisk":"__disk__35\/af\/88\/35af889c8ffd123d68bafe5a2e22196321516c4d","contentType":"x-gis\/x-shapefile","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/54494685e4b0f888a81bb4d9?f=__disk__35%2Faf%2F88%2F35af889c8ffd123d68bafe5a2e22196321516c4d"},{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":1795272,"dateUploaded":"2014-10-23T18:11:28.000Z","name":"BT_CSC_NHD_1kmDataModel_Patches_Dissolve_Merge.dbf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__7e\/90\/94\/7e909407617954829811eb9cf2e5a35cf8a9d3f7","contentType":"application\/octet-stream","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/54494685e4b0f888a81bb4d9?f=__disk__7e%2F90%2F94%2F7e909407617954829811eb9cf2e5a35cf8a9d3f7"},{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":24980,"dateUploaded":"2014-10-23T18:11:20.000Z","name":"BT_CSC_NHD_1kmDataModel_Patches_Dissolve_Merge.shx","pathOnDisk":"__disk__b5\/a5\/72\/b5a572c858bd4439c186a5e281b83656dbcdef50","contentType":"x-gis\/x-shapefile","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/54494685e4b0f888a81bb4d9?f=__disk__b5%2Fa5%2F72%2Fb5a572c858bd4439c186a5e281b83656dbcdef50"},{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":441,"dateUploaded":"2014-10-23T18:11:19.000Z","name":"BT_CSC_NHD_1kmDataModel_Patches_Dissolve_Merge.prj","pathOnDisk":"__disk__c3\/be\/e3\/c3bee3df69b61771b199751cfd9700c81d97054f","contentType":"text\/plain;

having input to the development of their research agenda and priorities.&nbsp;CDSC has been designated as the lead university partner with responsibility for conducting the regional northwest NCA workshop in cooperation with designated federal agencies in the region.&nbsp;The NCA workshop will bring together regional stakeholders that are most interested in understanding regional climate impacts, exploring their climate related problems, and in applying adaptive solutions for their sectors.&nbsp;Beyond mere engagement, the workshop also&nbsp;initiated&nbsp;an iterative process of participatory activities and communication about the NCA in the region and as a backdrop to regional assessment processes that also will contribute to the national process as a whole.&nbsp;The regional NCA workshop had two main objectives: (1) convene and launch a process for coordinating the NCA in the northwest region working with Federal agency leads, the NW CSC, three regional Landscape Conservation Cooperatives, and other relevant stakeholders, including how technical input to the report and NCA will be coordinated; and (2) outline and initiate development of a regional NCA synthesis for delivery to the NCA by March 2012.&nbsp;Funding was used to support the workshop and to fund travel for selected stakeholders.<\/p>","parentId":"5006c1e5e4b0abf7ce733f3b","contacts":[{"name":"Phil Mote","oldPartyId":64905,"type":"Principal

warming sensitivity of Cascades snowpacks","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1748-9326\/11\/8\/084009\/meta):&nbsp;Record low snowpack conditions were observed at Snow Telemetry stations in the Cascades Mountains, USA during the winters of 2014 and 2015. We tested the hypothesis that these winters are analogs for the temperature sensitivity of Cascades snowpacks. In the Oregon Cascades, the 2014 and 2015 winter air temperature anomalies were approximately +2 \u00b0C and +4 \u00b0C above the climatological mean. We used a spatially distributed snowpack energy balance model to simulate the sensitivity of multiple snowpack metrics to a +2 \u00b0C and +4 \u00b0C warming and compared our modeled sensitivities to observed values during 2014 and 2015. We found that for each +1 \u00b0C warming, modeled basin-mean peak snow water equivalent (SWE) declined by 22%\u201330%, the date of peak SWE (DPS) advanced by 13 days, the duration of snow cover (DSC) shortened by 31\u201334 days, and the snow disappearance date (SDD) advanced by 22\u201325 days. Our hypothesis was not borne out by the observations except in the case of peak SWE; other snow metrics did not resemble predicted values based on modeled sensitivities and thus are not effective analogs of future temperature sensitivities. Rather than just temperature, it appears that the magnitude and phasing of winter precipitation events, such as large, late spring snowfall, controlled the DPS, SDD, and DSC.","parentId":"5046442fe4b0241d49d62c4a","contacts":[{"name":"IOP Publishing","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Matthew G Cooper","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of California"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Anne W Nolin","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Oregon State Universit"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Mohammad Safeeq","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of California"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1748-9326\/11\/8\/084009\/meta","title":"Cooper et al. 2016, Environmental Research Letters","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"snow"},{"name":"drought"},{"name":"temperature sensitivity"},{"name":"snow water equivalent"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2016-08-08","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-10-18T14:53:35.121-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-18T14:58:43.854-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Environmental Research Letters","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issn","value":"1748-9326"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"volume","value":"11"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issue","value":"8"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"startPage","value":"084009"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1088\/1748-9326\/11\/8\/084009"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Matthew G Cooper","Anne W Nolin","Mohammad Safeeq"],"orgs":["IOP Publishing","Northwest CSC"]},"55e07a67e4b0f42e3d040f3c":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"55e07a67e4b0f42e3d040f3c","title":"The Available Science Assessment Project (ASAP): Evaluating Adaptation Actions for Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Change in the Pacific Northwest","body":"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing resource management. The disruptions it is causing require that we change the way we consider management in order to ensure the future of habitats, species, and human communities. Practitioners often struggle with how to identify and prioritize specific climate adaptation actions (CAAs). Management actions may have a higher probability of being successful if they are informed by available scientific knowledge and findings. The goal of the Available Science Assessment Project (ASAP) is to synthesize and evaluate the body of scientific knowledge on specific, on-the-ground CAAs to determine the conditions, timeframes, and geographic areas where particular CAAs may be most effective for resource managers. We have derived a methodology that utilizes literature reviews and interviews, an expert elicitation process, and extensive engagement with natural resource managers and scientists from federal, state, tribal, and private entities in Washington and Oregon working to address sea level rise.

The disruptions it is causing require that we change the way we consider conservation and resource management in order to ensure the future of habitats, species, and human communities. Practitioners often struggle with how to identify and prioritize specific climate adaptation actions (CAAs). Management actions may have a higher probability of being successful if they are informed by available scientific knowledge and findings; a systematic review process provides a mechanism to scientifically assess management questions. By evaluating specific actions on scientific knowledge and findings, we may be able to increase management effectiveness and efficiency. The goal of the Available Science Assessment Project (ASAP) is to synthesize and evaluate the body of scientific knowledge on specific, on-the-ground CAAs to determine the conditions, timeframes, and geographic areas where particular CAAs may be most effective for resource managers. We have derived a methodology that utilizes interviews, a systematic review process, and extensive engagement with natural resource managers and scientists throughout the Northwest Climate Science Center (NW CSC) region. For a test case, we will evaluate the science behind specific fire management actions in national forests in the region.","parentId":"531899cce4b051b1b924ea01","contacts":[{"name":"Lisa Gaines","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"lisa.gaines@oregonstate.edu","organization":{"displayText":"Institute for Natural Resources, Oregon State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Rachel M.

However, if forests can be managed to retain snow longer, some of these environmental and financial impacts may be mitigated. Recent results from our research team demonstrate that in areas with relatively warm winters, strategically-cut forest gaps could offset climatic warming by increasing snow retention on the landscape and delaying runoff. However, in areas with colder winters, the opposite is true, as snow lasts longer under the forest canopy. We will map these climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect snow duration in different locations and testing those predictions against careful observations from our field sites and a network of citizen scientists. Working with regional forest and water managers, we will identify strategies for applying these findings to decision-making, linking climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management. Results from this project will help managers to act strategically to maximize snow retention (protecting forests in some areas while opening gaps in others), providing more water later in the season for hydropower, agriculture, and fish flows.","parentId":"541b07bee4b01571b3d654fc","contacts":[{"name":"Jessica Lundquist","oldPartyId":66563,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jdlund@u.washington.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Jessica","lastName":"Lundquist","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Susan E.

However, if forests can be managed to retain snow longer, some of these environmental and financial impacts may be mitigated. Recent results from our research team demonstrate that in areas with relatively warm winters, strategically-cut forest gaps could offset climatic warming by increasing snow retention on the landscape and delaying runoff. However, in areas with colder winters, the opposite is true, as snow lasts longer under the forest canopy. We will map these climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect snow duration in different locations and testing those predictions against careful observations from our field sites and a network of citizen scientists. Working with regional forest and water managers, we will identify strategies for applying these findings to decision-making, linking climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management. Results from this project will help managers to act strategically to maximize snow retention (protecting forests in some areas while opening gaps in others), providing more water later in the season for hydropower, agriculture, and fish flows.","parentId":"541b07bee4b01571b3d654fc","contacts":[{"name":"Jessica Lundquist","oldPartyId":66563,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jdlund@u.washington.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Jessica","lastName":"Lundquist","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Susan E.

href=\"http:\/\/journals.ametsoc.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1175\/JHM-D-13-0167.1\">http:\/\/journals.ametsoc.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1175\/JHM-D-13-0167.1<\/a>):&nbsp;Drought indices are often used for monitoring interannual variability in macroscale hydrology. However, the diversity of drought indices raises several issues: 1) which indices perform best and where; 2) does the incorporation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) in indices strengthen relationships, and how sensitive is the choice of PET methods to such results; 3) what additional value is added by using higher-spatial-resolution gridded climate layers; and 4) how have observed relationships changed through time. Standardized precipitation index, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), Palmer drought severity index, and water balance runoff (WBR) model output were correlated to water-year runoff for 21 unregulated drainage basins in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. SPEI and WBR with time scales encompassing the primary precipitation season maximized the explained variance in water-year runoff in most basins. Slightly stronger correlations were found using PET estimates from the Penman-Monteith method over the Thornthwaite method, particularly for time periods that incorporated the spring and summer months in basins that receive appreciable precipitation during the growing season. Indices computed using high-resolution climate surfaces explained over 10% more variability than metrics derived from coarser-resolution datasets. Increased correlation in the latter half of the study period was partially attributable to increased streamflow variability in recent decades as well as to improved climate data quality across the interior mountain watersheds.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> \n<strong>This publication was developed as a part of the project,&nbsp; <a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/display-project\/4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46\/5006eb9de4b0abf7ce733f5c\">Integrated Scenarios of Climate, Hydrology, and Vegetation for the Northwest<\/a><\/strong>.","parentId":"50463e10e4b0241d49d62c35","contacts":[{"name":"John T.

Yet, climate-induced tree mortality and biotic disturbance agents are largely absent from process-based ecosystem models. Using data sets from the western USA and associated studies, we present a framework for determining the relative contribution of drought stress, insect attack, and their interactions, which is critical for modeling mortality in future climates. We outline a simple approach that identifies the mechanisms associated with two guilds of insects \u2013 bark beetles and defoliators \u2013 which are responsible for substantial tree mortality. We then discuss cross-biome patterns of insect-driven tree mortality and draw upon available evidence contrasting the prevalence of insect outbreaks in temperate and tropical regions. We conclude with an overview of tools and promising avenues to address major challenges. Ultimately, a multitrophic approach that captures tree physiology, insect populations, and tree\u2013insect interactions will better inform projections of forest ecosystem responses to climate change.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50465652e4b0241d49d62c9a"],"contacts":[{"name":"William R.

These objectives were designed to address decision support needs for climate adaptation and resource management actions. Specifically, understanding of uncertainty in climate projections - in particular for extreme events - is currently a key scientific and management barrier to adaptation planning and vulnerability assessment. The new dataset fills in the Northwest domain to cover a key gap in the previous dataset, adds additional projections (both from other global climate models and a comparison with dynamical downscaling) and includes an assessment of changes to flow and soil moisture extremes. This new information can be used to assess variations in impacts across the landscape, uncertainty in projections, and how these differ as a function of region, variable, and time period.<br> <br> In this project, existing University of Washington Climate Impacts Group (UW CIG) products were extended to develop a comprehensive data archive that accounts (in a rigorous and physically based way) for climate model uncertainty in future climate and hydrologic scenarios. These products can be used to determine likely impacts on vegetation and aquatic habitat in the Pacific Northwest region, including WA, OR, ID, northwest MT to the continental divide, northern CA, NV, UT, and the Columbia Basin portion of western WY. New data series and summaries produced for this project include: (1) extreme statistics for surface hydrology (e.g., frequency of soil moisture and summer water deficit) and streamflow (e.g. the 100-\u00adyear flood, extreme 7-\u00adday low flows with a 10-\u00adyear recurrence interval); (2) snowpack vulnerability as indicated by the ratio of April 1 snow water to cool-\u00adseason precipitation; and&nbsp;(3) uncertainty analyses for multiple climate scenarios.&nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"5006c1e5e4b0abf7ce733f3b","contacts":[{"name":"Eric Salath\u00e9","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"salathe@uw.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington Bothell Science and Technology Program"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jeremy Littell","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jlittell@uw.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington Climate Impacts Group"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"206-221-2997","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alan Hamlet","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"hamleaf@uw.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Nathan Mantua","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"nmantua@uw.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Washington, School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","oldPartyId":59609,"type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Climate change"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Hydrology"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"extreme events"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Location","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Location","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Northwest CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2011"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2011-07-15","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2013-06-30","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2012-07-18T11:08:39.362-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-20T13:32:42.231-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"Completed","facetName":"Project","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Expando","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ExpandoFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":150000,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2011","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":150000}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":910,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":260791,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2016-02-25T21:39:26.000Z","name":"NW-2011-11_HohRiver_WA_AlanCressler.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__06\/0e\/94\/060e9421da1f5f667c62aea0a9e895a03493e706","title":"Hoh River, WA -

The sustainability of estuarine ecosystems relies heavily on local water delivery, suspended sediment availability, primary productivity, and relative sea-level rise. Changing ocean and atmospheric conditions are likely to reshape these ecosystems and species that rely on them. Efforts to project ecosystem change along the Pacific coast due to ecological drought and sea-level rise have largely relied on regional scale data which is not representative of local estuaries and at the scale of management decision. We propose a process-based approach to integrate data from multiple disciplines into empirical models describing current and future conditions and associated habitat changes with ecological drought and sea-level rise. This approach is transferable across coastal Climate Science Centers (CSCs) and Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs). Specifically, we propose three overarching objectives: (1) Hold in-person meetings with resource managers to identify key ecological drought-sea-level rise management concerns for their estuaries, (2) Leverage and analyze long-term existing datasets of river levels and discharge rates, as well as available water quality data, to determine how drought has affected these abiotic factors historically and currently, and (3) Use data on biotic communities as they relate to drought-sensitive abiotic drivers (e.g., salinity, water temperature, nutrients, sediment), to help inform key management questions identified by resource managers within each estuary (salmonids, vegetation, etc.).

Impacts are particularly strong in cities, where the urban heat island can raise stream temperatures even within greenspaces. However, specifically how urban warming \u2013 or cooling, such as by tree shade \u2013 affects the temperature of stormwater runoff from streets to storm drains is surprisingly sparsely documented. This is important because storm drains of many cities in the Pacific Northwest discharge directly to cold-water aquatic ecosystems.

This study will test whether explicitly managing the urban forest canopy to reduce street runoff temperatures (TR) is an innovative and practical tool to mitigate urban contributions to urban and downstream ecological drought. This particularly innovative idea to help address ecological drought would leverage the substantial, highly managed urban forest \u201ccapital\u201d to simply address an additional variable, TR, at little additional management cost. It would also be both mitigative of ecological drought and adaptive to climate change (as some aspects of relative cooling increase with energy load).  \r\nBackground. While the urban heat island is known to raise stream temperatures even within greenspaces, data are lacking on street-level TR and its relationship to street tree canopy (STC). This is important because curbside storm drain systems of many cities in the Pacific Northwest discharge directly to cold-water aquatic ecosystems. Large quantities of rapid runoff already can create impairment in receiving waters, and elevated runoff temperature could duplicate or exacerbate climate-driven aquatic system ecological drought.   \r\nMethods. There are 4 specific objectives of this study. [1] Empirically quantify the effects of STC cover and tree type on street runoff temperature (TR) by 2 years of original field monitoring of TR within a 2x2 factorial experimental design (high\/low STC cover vs. deciduous\/coniferous tree types), throughout the range of weather and phenology in Portland, OR, as a pilot case study. [2] Develop a physics-based model based on 1D heat transport in a stream, but adapted to rapid, shallow stormwater flow over pavement and under intermittent shade, to predict spatially-explicit street gutter TR given variable STC, urbanization, and climate influences. [3] Predict urban tree types more likely to be healthy and beneficial (i.e., good investments) for mitigating downstream ecological drought under future climate warming stress by statistically analyzing the health of street trees in recent inventories across the PNW (\u22658 cities, \u2265334,000 trees) compared to the relative warmth of their location within the local urban heat island. [4] Compare the field and modeling with the USDA Forest Service urban forest decision-support model suite i-Tree, recommend i-Tree updates to represent currently missing TR and its relationships to STC, and add to the i-Tree Hydro module a means to assess potential TR influences on downstream ecological drought.  \r\nProducts, Partners, and Information Transfer. The field data, statistical analyses, and numerical models will be collaboratively reviewed and shared with a partner in Portland Environmental Services leading the street tree planting and education program and the originators of the PNW-wide city street tree inventories, presented at public (seminar, education, and outreach activities) and academic forums, documented in peer-reviewed manuscripts, and made publically available as per the Data Management Plan."}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Type","value":"Cooperative

parameterize accretion for SLR models, we measured historic rates of mineral and organic matter accumulation at each site by collecting deep soil cores with a Russian peat borer. At each site, we obtained cores in each of three vegetation zones: low, medium, and high marsh. Two replicate cores were sampled from each station for a total of 6 cores per site (except Coos Bay where 7 cores were taken). Coring locations were determined by RTK GPS elevation and tidal inundation data. Transects for core sampling were determined in ArcGIS, using a digitial elevation model and site-specific tidal datums to choose station locations below MHW (low), between MHW and MHHW (mid), and above MHHW (high). Sediment cores were 50 cm deep and 5 cm in diameter. In the lab, we cut cores into 1 cm sections to process for bulk density, porosity, and organic matter composition using loss on ignition in a muffle furnace at 550&ordm;C for 8 hr. Only half of the cores collected were processed for bulk density, organic matter and Cesuim dating (one replicate). We used Cesium-137 (137Cs) isotope dating techniques to determine accumulation rates in deep soil cores. Atmospheric nuclear testing prior to 1964 resulted in the spread of 137Cs across the globe creating a reliable marker horizon in soils. We used a gamma spectrometer at the Oregon State University Radiation Center to detect 137Cs activity, measured in picocuries (pCi), in 1 cm core samples for 24 hr. We standardized the 137Cs activity of each sample to its mass. The depth of the 137Cs peak activity indicated the 1964 marker horizon, which we used to determine average soil accretion rates over the last half century. Not every processed core had a distinct peak of Cesium 137.","purpose":"Data was collected to parameterize accretion for SLR models.","parentId":"55ae7b23e4b066a249242391","contacts":[{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey -

The studies presented here examine trends in different socioecological values under different climate and management assumptions using a dynamic global vegetation model\/STSM approach. The authors found that simulated management actions did not prevent climate-induced vegetation change. Simulated management did in some cases promote desired forest structures and increase resilience to climate change. The chapter describes in detail the method that uses MC1 projections to create climate-informed STSMs. Finally, it explains the potential improvements and applications for future work, including a fully integrated approach using both the direct effect of climate change on vegetation and indirect effects of human activities, including changes in land use.","parentId":"50465355e4b0241d49d62c8b","contacts":[{"name":"Joshua S.

They provide natural places for recreation, clean drinking water, and important habitats for fish and wildlife. However, the warmer temperatures and harsher droughts in the west that are related to climate change are causing die-offs of many trees. Outbreaks of insects, like the mountain pine beetle, that kill trees are also more likely in warmer, drier conditions.<br>\n<br>\nTo maintain healthy and functioning forest ecosystems, one action forest managers can take is to make management decisions that will help forests adapt to future climate change. However, adaptation is a process based on genetic change and few tools are currently available for managers to use to incorporate genetic information into management decision-making. Information is needed that links the responses of trees to environmental change and to develop genetic profiles of resistant trees. This information could then be used in screening for adaptive genetic traits and to assess genetic diversity.<br>\n<br>\nThis project will help gather that information through a pilot study focusing on mountain pine beetles and whitebark pine trees in western Montana. Researchers are investigating whether the current mountain pine beetle outbreak has resulted in the selection (survival and reproduction) of drought tolerant, and consequently, beetle resistant whitebark pines.&nbsp;They will examine tree core samples, tree resin, and pine needles to understand characteristics of the remaining forests and to collect DNA. From this work, the team expects to develop an easy and economical approach for screening whitebark pine trees for drought tolerance, beetle resistance, and genetic diversity that can be used in the conservation and restoration of this threatened, ecologically important high elevation tree, and other conifers experiencing climate-driven bark beetle outbreaks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","purpose":"We will evaluate whether outbreaks of mountain pine beetle select for residual forests better adapted to warmer, drier conditions, and consequently, with greater resistance to bark beetle attack. This pilot project will assess tree rings, climate data, and genetic profiles in tandem, to identify drought-tolerant, beetle-resistant trees and provide information directly useful in transforming management to support forest adaptation to climate change. The ultimate goal is to identify a small set of easily scored markers that can be used by managers to reliably detect drought-tolerant trees.","parentId":"57daef3fe4b090824ffc3226","contacts":[{"name":"Diana Six","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"diana.six@cfc.umt.edu","organization":{"displayText":"The University of Montana"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"406 531 1813","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"59812","country":"USA","city":"Missoula","state":"Montana","line1":"32 Campus Drive, Dept.

Meeting this challenge requires the consideration of&nbsp;information about the effects of management, disturbance, land use, and climate change on ecosystems. State-and-transition simulation models (STSMs) provide a flexible framework for integrating landscape processes and comparing alternative management scenarios, but incorporating climate change is an active area of research. In this presentation, three researchers present work funded by Climate Science Centers across the country to incorporate climate projections into STSMs.&nbsp;These three studies highlight the utility of STSMs for natural resource management in disparate ecosystems across the U.S.<\/p> \n<p>1) The first case study integrates&nbsp;<strong>species distribution modeling<\/strong>&nbsp;with STSMs to project changes in&nbsp;<strong>whitebark pine in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem<\/strong>. This combination of correlative and stochastic models reproduced historical observations, identified important data gaps, and described potential future declines in whitebark pine.<\/p> \n<p>2) The second study uses STSMs to address&nbsp;<strong>conservation and management<\/strong>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<strong>longleaf pine ecosystem in the southeastern U.S.<\/strong>&nbsp;under climate change and urbanization pressures. Results show that urbanization is likely to be a bigger threat to the future of the ecosystem than climate change.<br> <br> 3) The third study integrates multiple models to project&nbsp;<strong>future rangeland condition and habitat for greater sage-grouse in eastern Oregon<\/strong>&nbsp;under varying climate and management scenarios. Projections indicate that rangeland condition and habitat are likely to decline due to current stressors, but climate change may have both positive and negative impacts.<br> <br> &nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"5046535ee4b0241d49d62c8f","contacts":[{"name":"Jennifer Costanza","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Megan Creutzburg","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Portland State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Brian Miller","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Colorado State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/webinar\/455","title":"Webinar Recording, May 2015","hidden":false}],"tags":[{"name":"Simulation models"},{"name":"Sage-Grouse"},{"name":"Whitebark Pine"},{"name":"Longleaf pine"}],"dates":[{"type":"Transmitted","dateString":"2015-05-07","label":"Date Transmitted "},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-05-28T06:01:51.143-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-02-26T09:16:38.359-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Jennifer Costanza","Megan Creutzburg","Brian Miller"]},"5012a0e8e4b05140039e02c4":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/527c3102e4b0050d7e26b7da","rel":"related to","relatedRel":"related","title":"Using Yurok Traditional Ecological Knowledge to Set Climate Change Priorities","relatedTitle":"Utilizing Yurok Traditional Ecological Knowledge to Inform Climate Change Priorities","id":"5012a0e8e4b05140039e02c4","relatedId":"527c3102e4b0050d7e26b7da","annotation":"this is a co-funded project"},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5012a0e8e4b05140039e02c4","rel":"related","relatedRel":"related to","title":"Utilizing Yurok Traditional Ecological Knowledge to Inform Climate Change Priorities","relatedTitle":"Using Yurok Traditional Ecological Knowledge to Set Climate Change Priorities","id":"527c3102e4b0050d7e26b7da","relatedId":"5012a0e8e4b05140039e02c4","annotation":"this is a co-funded project"}]},"id":"5012a0e8e4b05140039e02c4","title":"Using Yurok Traditional Ecological Knowledge to Set Climate Change Priorities","body":"<div>\n The Yurok Ancestral Territory, which spans northwestern California from the coastal redwood-spruce rainforest to inland forests and prairies, has provided the Yurok Tribe with an abundance of food and cultural resources for millennia. The Yurok Tribe maintains stewardship responsibility for their Ancestral Lands, which include the Yurok Reservation, and is concerned about the potential impacts of climate change on culturally significant species and the ecosystems that support them.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> This project had two broad objectives: The first was to meet the needs of the Yurok Tribe in collecting traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) to identify priority areas and activities for helping the Tribe plan for and respond to climate change. The second objective was to provide a culturally appropriate model for how tribes and non-tribal entities (including federal agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) could collect, document, and integrate TEK into decision making. TEK is often proprietary, culturally sensitive, and privileged information, even within a tribal community. Researchers sought to develop a process that would protect the confidentiality and intellectual property rights of community members to preserve the integrity of the information and wisdom involved and to reinforce the responsibility of those who possess and share it.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> Researchers conducted structured interviews with elders from the Yurok Tribe and used ethnographic methods to analyze the results. From this analysis, several general themes emerged. For example, Yurok elders have a good understanding of how the environment has changed over the last 200 years. They identified numerous species, including salmon, sturgeon, elk, and porcupine, whose populations have undergone serious declines in the past century. In addition, elders were particularly concerned about observed changes in temperature, flow, and water quality of the Klamath River. These and other environmental changes could disrupt traditional ways of Yurok life.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> \n <strong>This project was jointly supported by the Northwest Climate Science Center and the North Pacific Landscape Conservation Cooperative.<\/strong>\n<\/div>","purpose":"The Yurok Tribe and the Yurok Reservation are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to the location and unique ecosystem that comprise Yurok Ancestral Lands, including the Yurok Reservation. The Yurok Tribe, per its tradition, history and Constitution, assert stewardship responsibilities for all resources within their Ancestral Lands. Further, the Yurok Tribe has management responsibilities for all resources within their Reservation Lands. The objective of this project was to collect and utilize Yurok Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) information to identify priority areas for tribal research, resource management, and adaptation planning to assist the Tribe in responding and adapting to or mitigating climate change impacts. It also was intended to serve as a model, utilizing culturally-appropriate ethnographic methods, for tribes and non-tribal entities (such as federal resource managers like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and others) to incorporate TEK in identifying science and management priorities, methods, and responses to the complex issues of climate change where mutually beneficial. General themes based on observed changes over time emerged from interviews with tribal elders and were identified as concerns by the participants. These involve the decrease in the presence, abundance, or availability of species; loss of habitats and ecosystems; changes in timing and associations traditionally relied upon to signal the timing of migratory species; and even the complete disappearance of some species. Serious concerns about observed changes in Klamath River and tributary flows, temperatures, and water quality were expressed. Many remarked on changing seasons, changes in temperature, changes in precipitation associated with specific seasons, loss of fog, and the current historic (2014) drought. Everyone had observed gradual and progressive changes over their lifetimes in numerous resources and ecosystems. Community structures have changed and TEK associations signaling the arrival and availability of many foods may no longer work as a result of these changes.","parentId":"5006c2c9e4b0abf7ce733f42","contacts":[{"name":"Kathleen Sloan","type":"Principal

These hybrid vegetation models were then used to inform bird distribution models0. The data covers three time periods (1970-1999), (2035-2064), and (2070-2099) for 59 vegetation types based on a hybrid vegetation map derived from the GAP vegetation classification system (http:\/\/gapanalysis.usgs.gov\/gaplandcover\/)together with climate covariates (historic), and environmental covariates driven by MC2, a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). Current climate data was based on PRISM (www.prism.oregonstate.edu\/). Future climate data was based on downscaled projections (4km) developed by the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) project. Models were trained using data from Oregon, Washington, California, and Nevada. Areas representing developed\/urban, developed\/open space, pasture\/hay, and cropland\/agriculture in the GAP layer were kept the same in future periods and any other veg types were masked out from

2012-2014","body":"We conducted vegetation surveys concurrently with elevation surveys at every fourth elevation point (~25% of the elevation points) (Figure 5). We visually assessed percent cover of all plant species within a 0.25 m2 quadrat, and recorded the average and maximum height (measured to the nearest centimeter) of each species. Total plant cover in a plot could exceed 100% due to vegetation layering. Vascular plant nomenclature generally follows Baldwin et al. (2012) and Cook et al. (2013). We located 69 tidal wetland species in 2,154 vegetation plots across the nine estuaries in the study. Common species included Carex lyngbyei, Sarcocornia perennis, Distichlis spicata, Deschampsia cespitosa, Juncus balticus and Potentilla anserina. The frequency of several common species varied markedly across the sites. Distichlis spicata dominated the flora at five of the nine sites, but was relatively uncommon at Port Susan and Grays Harbor. Deschampsia cespitosa, a middle to high marsh tussock-forming species was frequent at the three Oregon sites and at Willapa but much less common in Puget Sound marshes. The high marsh rush, Juncus balticus, was most frequent at Siletz and absent or rare at Willapa and Padilla. Carex lyngbyei occurrence was variable regionally, ranging from &gt;75% frequency at Bull Island to near absence at Padilla (it did not occur in any surveyed plots, but a few plants were observed at the upland margin of the site in late 2014). See appendices for detailed site specific results. We delineated marsh zones using long-term NOAA tidal data combined with our site-specific elevation and water level data and examined plant abundance in these major zones across the sites. At many sites, plant composition tended to vary by zone, but not necessarily in consistent ways across the region. For instance, at Bandon, Sarcocornia perennis was the most abundant high marsh species (with Deschampsia cespitosa most abundant in middle and low marsh), while S. perennis was the most abundant plant in low marsh at Grays Harbor (Carex spp. dominated in mid-marsh and Potentilla anserina dominated high marsh). Vertical zonation of plant assemblages was less pronounced at other sites, including Nisqually where Distichlis spicata had the highest mean cover in all three major marsh zones. Low marsh habitat was common at Bull Island, Willapa, Nisqually, and Port Susan. Common species in this zone included Sarcocornia perennis, Distichlis spicata, Carex lyngbyei, and Triglochin maritima. Middle tidal marsh was present at all of the sites and particularly common at Skokomish. Common species included all of the aforementioned taxa and Deschampsia cespitosa, Juncus balticus, and Agrostis stolonifera. High marsh was only common at Bandon, Siletz, Willapa, Grays Harbor, and Padilla. Common high marsh species included many species found in other zones, but also included Potentilla anserine and Atriplex prostrata. Transition zone habitat (defined as wetland flooding at least once per year but no more than once per month) was limited at most of our study sites. Zonation of individual species per site are illustrated in the respective appendices.","purpose":"In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.","parentId":"55b277e0e4b09a3b01b53674","contacts":[{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey - ScienceBase","type":"Distributor","email":"sciencebase@usgs.gov","primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"1-888-275-8747","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"80225","city":"Denver","state":"CO","line1":"Denver Federal Center, Building 810, Mail Stop 302"}}},{"name":"Chase Freeman, USGS Western Ecological Research Center","type":"Metadata Contact","email":"cfreeman@usgs.gov","primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"5095511746","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"98516","city":"Olympia","state":"WA","line1":"100 Brown Farm Road"}}},{"name":"Karen Thorne, US Geological Survey","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Christopher Janousek, Oregon State University","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"Online Link","uri":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.5066\/F7SJ1HNC","rel":"related","hidden":false},{"type":"webLink","uri":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.5066\/F7SJ1HNC","rel":"related","title":"Access point for data","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Data"],"tags":[{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"percent cover"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"plant height"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"plant communities"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Washington"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Oregon"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Pacific Northwest"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Siletz"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Willapa"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Coos Bay"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Bandon"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Port Susan"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Skokomish"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Grays Harbor"},{"type":"Place","scheme":"None","name":"Nisqually"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015-06-26","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"Start","dateString":"2013-12-01","label":""},{"type":"End","dateString":"2014-04-30","label":""},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-07-24T18:41:08.014-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-03-16T07:30:37.482-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":7465324,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-07-25T00:38:51.000Z","name":"veg_final.zip","pathOnDisk":"__disk__97\/5b\/63\/975b63f79515d6309083b6572a6e6290f83690b3","title":"","contentType":"application\/zip","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55b2db24e4b09a3b01b5d9da?f=__disk__97%2F5b%2F63%2F975b63f79515d6309083b6572a6e6290f83690b3"},{"originalMetadata":true,"processed":false,"size":12526,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-08-10T22:53:30.000Z","name":"vegetation_metadata.fgdc.xml","pathOnDisk":"__disk__63\/58\/6c\/63586c28c639ecb189d1594e9cabe2d845708037","title":"","contentType":"application\/fgdc+xml","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55b2db24e4b09a3b01b5d9da?f=__disk__63%2F58%2F6c%2F63586c28c639ecb189d1594e9cabe2d845708037"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55b2db24e4b09a3b01b5d9da","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"VegetationSurve.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46"},"52376ee9e4b0d5f108fb5c87":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"52376ee9e4b0d5f108fb5c87","title":"Vulnerability of Culturally Significant Plants on the Olympic Peninsula","body":"<div>\n<p>Tribes in the Pacific Northwest rely on plants for food, medicine, and material for culturally important items (e.g., baskets, cages and traps, ceremonial items, tools, and musical instruments). Elders and wisdomkeepers from tribes of the Point No Point Treaty Council have expressed deep concerns about the potential effects of climate change on plant species of key cultural significance, particularly those located in tribal gathering areas on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThis project was a direct response to tribal concerns about the loss of culturally significant plants from tribal gathering areas. Researchers conducted interviews with elders from the Port Gamble S\u2019Klallam Tribe to identify eight plants of key cultural concern because of their growing scarcity, including wild berries, yew, Western redcedar, yarrow, and cattail. Researchers then documented the historical and current distribution and abundance of the eight key plants and used climate models to predict future changes for these species. This research provides baseline information that can be used by tribal and non-tribal resource managers to continue documenting changes and to develop management options for addressing shifting ranges and abundance of culturally significant plant species.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","purpose":"This short-term project responded to concerns about the disappearance of culturally important plants in traditional gathering areas expressed by elders of the Port Gamble S\u2019Klallam Tribe (PGST) (Olympic Peninsula, WA), both currently and in response to continuing climate change. A formal Memorandum of Understanding was developed between Oregon State University and the PGST to guide this culturally sensitive research. We recommend this formal approach to researchers considering tribal partnerships in order to ensure expectations of all parties are clearly outlined. During formal interviews and informal conversation, PGST elders mentioned 37 plants, of which eight terrestrial species and a group of marine taxa were of particular concern due to limited availabilities in 26 traditional gathering locations within the Usual and Accustomed (U&A) gathering area, guaranteed by the 1855 Point No Point Treaty. Landsat data were used to analyze recent changes in land cover within the U&A. Substantial changes in land cover were found between 1975 and 2010. Detailed analysis for 1990-2010 documented recent forest fragmentation, loss of freshwater wetlands, and both losses and gains of saltwater wetlands. Current regional distribution and autecological information for the eight focal terrestrial species were compiled using available databases, herbarium records, and literature. Field studies documented plant communities in which selected focal species are currently found.\n\nDownscaled results from existing Pacific Northwest climate scenarios were adapted to the Olympic and Kitsap Peninsula, which house the U&A. These suggest somewhat hotter, drier summers and somewhat warmer, wetter conditions in other seasons by the late 21st century. Changes in seasonal precipitation were less clear, with uncertainty regarding the magnitude and even direction of change. Published information related to climate variables for the eight focal species was sparse, making even semi-quantitative projections of response to changing climates impossible. In addition, we created map of the U&A shoreline representing expected changes in shoreline due to changing climates combined with tectonic events. In summary, this project established a baseline on which future studies of vulnerable traditional women\u2019s plants can be built.","parentId":"5238c2d0e4b0c7d45ef072bc","contacts":[{"name":"Jesse Ford","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"Jesse.Ford@oregonstate.edu","firstName":"Jesse","lastName":"Ford","organization":{"displayText":"Oregon State University","directoryId":"23458"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":{"zip":"97331-3803","country":"USA","city":"Corvallis","state":"OR","line2":"104 Nash Hall, Oregon State University","line1":"Dept.

Each site had one or two loggers (n = 16). We placed loggers at the mouth and upper reaches of second-order tidal channels to capture high tides and determine seasonal inundation patterns. Water loggers collected water level readings every six minutes starting on the date of deployment and continuing to the present. We used data from the lowest elevation logger at each site to develop local hydrographs and inundation rates. We surveyed loggers with RTK GPS at the time of deployment and at each data download that occurred quarterly, to correct for any vertical movement. We corrected all raw water level data with local time series of barometric pressure. For Solinst loggers, we deployed independent barometric loggers (Model 3001, Solinst Canada Ltd., Georgetown, Ontario, Canada); for Hobo water level loggers, we used barometric pressure from local airports (distance less than 10 miles). To determine tidal channel salinities, we deployed one conductivity logger at each site next to the lower elevation water level logger (Odyssey conductivity\/temperature logger, Dataflow Systems Pty Limited, Christchurch, New Zealand). We converted specific conductance values obtained with the Odyssey loggers to practical salinity units using the equation from UNESCO (1983). We used water level data to estimate local tidal datums for all sites using procedures outlined in the NOAA Tidal Datums Handbook (NOAA, 2003). We only calculated local MHW and MHHW because the loggers were positioned in the intertidal, which is relatively high in the tidal frame, and therefore did not capture MLW or MLLW and could not be used to compute these lower datums. We estimated mean tide level (MTL) for each site by using NOAA\u2019s VDATUM 3.4 software (vdatum.noaa.gov), except at Bandon where we used MTL directly from historic NOAA data. Many results in this report are reported relative to local MHHW calculated from local water data. Water level loggers deployed within marsh channels recorded variation in water levels and salinity throughout the study duration. Loggers often did not capture lower portions of the tidal curve because of their location in tidal marsh channels which frequently drain at lower tides. From peak water levels, we calculated site-specific tidal datums (MHW and MHHW), and information on the highest observed water level (HOWL) during the time series. Our site specific tidal datum calculations generally closely matched tidal datums computed at nearby NOAA stations (tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). Differences likely reflect site-specific tidal and bathymetric conditions in local estuarine hydrology. We collected salinity data at all sites, however, due to equipment recalls and failure we do not have salinity data for the duration of the study. We report weekly maximum salinities since many of our salinity loggers were not submerged during the entire tidal cycle at all sites, except for Grays Harbor due to recalled loggers and loggers being washed away during storm events. We observed a high level of variation in salinity between and within sites. Siletz experienced the greatest variation in salinity during the study period, ranging from 0.8 to 32 ppt. Willapa was the freshest system, ranging from 12-15 ppt and had very little temporal variation. The largest variation in salinity at most sites occurred from September through December. All sites had salinity below 35 ppt throughout most of the year; however, the highest salinities were measured in August. See appendices for detailed site specific results.","purpose":"At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions. Overall tidal range decreased from northern Washington to southern Oregon.","parentId":"55b2e75ae4b09a3b01b5da00","contacts":[{"name":"Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research

Both cover the northwestern United States and part of southern British Columbia (N of about 38 degrees N and W of about 105 degrees W) at 1\/16th (0.0625) degree resolution. Climate and hydrologic variables (21 total) in each are as follows: precipitation, temperature (avg.\/max.\/min.), outgoing longwave radiation, incoming shortwave radiation, relative humidity, vapor pressure deficit, evapotranspiration, runoff, baseflow, soil moisture (3-layers), snow water equivalent, snow depth, and potential evapotranspiration (5 vegetation references). The first dataset, \"Western US Hydroclimate Scenarios Project Dynamically Downscaled Data\", contains daily dynamically downscaled climate projections and simulated land surface water and energy fluxes. &nbsp;The downscaling is based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional model. WRF was run using boundary conditions from the ECHAM5 global model and the SRES A1B emissions scenario, one of the models from Phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3), a critical source of data to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4).

Documentation home: http:\/\/cses.washington.edu\/cig\/data\/wus.shtml &nbsp;The second dataset, \"Western US Hydroclimate Scenarios Project Observations and Statistically Downscaled Data\", contains daily statistically downscaled climate projections and simulated land surface water and energy fluxes for the western United States and southern British Columbia at 1\/16th (0.0625) degree resolution. The downscaling used is the Modified Delta approach (see Littell et al. 2011), based on 10 models from Phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3), a critical source of data to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4).

Riparian wetlands are not included in this dataset. Accuracy is only verified for wetland ponds in the subalpine region. Forested wetlands, riparian wetlands, and emergent vegetation were only visually assessed. This data maps all wetland habitat, but was primarily used to locate and delineate amphibian habitat in Mt.

Despite the importance and vulnerability of wetlands, resources to support their scientific evaluation and management in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere have lagged substantially behind that of other ecosystem types. This interdisciplinary project combines complementary research efforts at multiple institutions and addresses wetlands across a range of locations and regions. Through the integration of remote sensing, hydrological, and biological modeling, as well as on-the-ground fieldwork, this research aims to explicitly characterize landscape-scale climate change impacts to wetland habitats and develop new approaches and technical tools needed to sustainably manage wetlands in a changing climate.","parentId":"504650b9e4b0241d49d62c6b","contacts":[{"name":"L.

Berries supply essential nutrients that prevent heart disease and cancer, are used for medicinal purposes, and are the only sweet food in the traditional Native diet. Hence, berries have both nutritional and cultural significance.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> From 2008 to 2012, wild berry populations in the Chugach region were decimated by an unexpected outbreak of moths, thought to have been brought about by shifting climate (i.e., warmer temperatures allowed a greater number of moths to survive the winter). This outbreak amounted to a total loss of blueberry and salmonberry harvests during these years, jeopardizing a tribal for-profit enterprise in the region. It also led to a need to restore berry production and to prepare for future threats from damaging insects.\n <br> \n <br> The goal of this project was to create maps and models that would help tribal and other land managers identify prime areas for berry restoration. Researchers used a variety of information sources, including remote sensing imagery, field data, and local tribal knowledge, to develop and verify these products. The resulting maps and models are helping tribal forest managers and local landowners target their berry restoration efforts where they are most likely to be successful and protected from future insect outbreaks, contributing to the reestablishment and future resilience of wild berry populations.\n <br> \n <br> \n <strong>This project was jointly supported by the Northwest Climate Science Center, the Alaska Climate Science Center, and the North Pacific Landscape Conservation Cooperative.<\/strong>\n<\/div>","purpose":"After a series of defoliation events from Geometrid moths from 2008 to 2012, defoliators not previously recorded by western science or remembered in tribal history, which lead to a total loss of blueberry and salmon berry subsistence harvests during those years our tribes were determined to restore and improve berry production. The Goal of our project was to develop predictive models to identify potential blueberry habitat on the southern tip the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska using model predictions, field data, and local knowledge.  Our project was successfully able to model and predict optimum blueberry habitat on the southern tip of the Kenai Peninsula Alaska.  We utilized Landsat imagery, digital elevation models, vegetation data, locally collected field data, and local tribal knowledge to build and verify the models.  We were not able to successfully develop a windthrow risk model.  These models will enable our Tribes to better manage the forest for blueberry resources especially in the face of a changing climate.  By identifying potential high quality blueberry habitat, berry habitat improvement treatments can be targeted in areas where treatments have the highest likelihood of being effective.  Treatments will result in more healthy and resilient blueberry picking areas.\n\nThis project is jointly supported by the Northwest Climate Science Center, the Alaska Climate Science Center, and the North Pacific Landscape Conservation Cooperative.","parentId":"52ab6f5ae4b078ad3e41b120","linkParentIds":["5238c2d0e4b0c7d45ef072bc"],"contacts":[{"name":"Nathan Lojewski","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"Nathan@chugachmiut.org","organization":{"displayText":"Chugachmiut Tribal Consortium"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alaska CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"North Pacific LCC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"John Lundquist","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USDA Forest Service"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Robin M.

A new study shows that the increase in wildfires may double soil erosion in some western U.S. states by 2050, and all that dirt ends up in streams, clogging creeks and degrading water quality.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> \n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.eurekalert.org\/pub_releases\/2015-11\/gsoa-wmd110315.php\">Read More in the&nbsp;\u200bAAAS News Release &gt;&gt;<\/a>","parentId":"531dc6c2e4b04cb293ee7832","contacts":[{"name":"Joel B Sankey","oldPartyId":24174,"type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jsankey@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Geologist","firstName":"Joel","middleName":"B","lastName":"Sankey","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Southwest Geographic Science Team"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9285567100","officePhone":"9285567289","streetAddress":{"zip":"86001","city":"Flagstaff","state":"AZ","line1":"2255 North Gemini Drive"},"buildingCode":"WZD","name":"Joel B Sankey\/GEOG\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"86001","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"150","city":"Flagstaff","state":"AZ","line1":"2255 North Gemini Drive, Mail Stop 150"},"building":"Bldgs.4And5"}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jason R Kreitler","oldPartyId":13836,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jkreitler@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Geographer","personalTitle":"Mr.","firstName":"Jason","middleName":"R","lastName":"Kreitler","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Western Geographic Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"2084265217","streetAddress":{"zip":"83706","city":"Boise","state":"ID","line1":"970 Lusk Street"},"buildingCode":"WID","name":"Jason R Kreitler\/GEOG\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"83706","country":"USA","city":"Boise","state":"ID","line1":"970 Lusk Street"},"building":"Snake River Field Station"}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.eurekalert.org\/pub_releases\/2015-11\/gsoa-wmd110315.php","title":"AAAS News Release, November 2015","hidden":false}],"tags":[{"name":"wildfire"},{"name":"watersheds"},{"name":"Vulnerability"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015-11-03","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-11-05T07:52:35.454-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-11-05T07:53:56.115-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46","people":["Joel B Sankey","Jason R Kreitler"],"orgs":["Northwest CSC"]}}

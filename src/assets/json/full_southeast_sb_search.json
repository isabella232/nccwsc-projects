Both factors are related to anthropogenic disturbances of the global carbon cycle. However, there are too few datasets at this time to make educated predictions on the precise impact of these factors. This study aimed to identify differences in climate vulnerability among three important reef-building coral species, and subsequently to inform resource management decisions regarding reef restoration and species protection policies. Project goals included a study addressing long-term variability in ocean temperature and acidification and the corresponding response of coral reef development. This data will be used as important baseline information as ocean conditions continue to change.&nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"5006f8e9e4b0abf7ce733fc9","contacts":[{"name":"Ilsa B

reefs: historic in situ observations","body":"<p>There is strong evidence that global climate change over the last several decades has caused shifts in species distributions, species extinctions, and alterations in the functioning of ecosystems. However, because of high variability on short (i.e., diurnal, seasonal, and annual) timescales as well as the recency of a comprehensive instrumental record, it is difficult to detect or provide evidence for long-term, site-specific trends in ocean temperature. Here we analyze five in situ datasets from Florida Keys coral reef habitats, including historic measurements taken by lighthouse keepers, to provide three independent lines of evidence supporting approximately 0.8 \u00b0C of warming in sea surface temperature (SST) over the last century. Results indicate that the warming observed in the records between 1878 and 2012 can be fully accounted for by the warming observed in recent decades (from 1975 to 2007), documented using in situ thermographs on a mid-shore patch reef. The magnitude of warming revealed here is similar to that found in other SST datasets from the region and to that observed in global mean surface temperature. The geologic context and significance of recent ocean warming to coral growth and population dynamics are discussed, as is the future prognosis for the Florida reef tract.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5049f641e4b02b6b9f7bd903"],"contacts":[{"name":"Ilsa B.

Systematic measurements of calcification over space and time are necessary to detect change resulting from environmental stressors. We established a network of calcification monitoring stations at four managed reefs along the outer\n<a href=\"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/search?dc.title=Florida+Keys&amp;facet-content-type=ReferenceWorkEntry&amp;sortOrder=relevance\">Florida Keys<\/a>&nbsp;Reef Tract (FKRT) from Miami to the Dry Tortugas. Eighty colonies (in two sequential sets of 40) of the reef-building coral,&nbsp;\n<em>Siderastrea siderea<\/em>, were transplanted to fixed apparatus that allowed repetitive detachment for buoyant weighing every 6&nbsp;months. Algal-recruitment tiles were also deployed during each weighing interval to measure net calcification of the crustose coralline algal (CCA) community. Coral-calcification rates were an order of magnitude greater than those of CCA. Rates of coral calcification were seasonal (summer calcification was 53&nbsp;% greater than winter), and corals in the Dry Tortugas calcified 48&nbsp;% faster than those at the other three sites. Linear extension rates were also highest in the Dry Tortugas, whereas percent area of the coral skeletons excavated by bioeroding fauna was lowest. The spatial patterns in net coral calcification revealed here correlate well with Holocene reef thickness along the FKRT and, in part, support the \u201cinimical waters hypothesis\u201d proposed by Ginsburg, Hudson, and Shinn almost 50&nbsp;yrs ago to explain reef development in this region. Due to the homogeneity in coral-calcification rates among the three main Keys sites, we recommend refinement of this hypothesis and suggest that water-quality variables (e.g., carbonate mineral saturation state, dissolved and particulate organic matter, light attenuation) be monitored alongside calcification in future studies. Our results demonstrate that our calcification monitoring network presents a feasible and worthwhile approach to quantifying potential impacts of ocean acidification, warming, and\/or deteriorating water quality on the process of calcification.","parentId":"5049f641e4b02b6b9f7bd903","contacts":[{"name":"Ilsa B Kuffner","oldPartyId":5729,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"ikuffner@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Ilsa","middleName":"B","lastName":"Kuffner","organization":{"displayText":"Coastal Geology Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"7278032032","streetAddress":{"zip":"33701","country":"US","city":"St. Petersburg","state":"FL","line1":"600 4th Street South"},"buildingCode":"AFP","name":"Ilsa B Kuffner\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

Strontium and calcium are incorporated into the coral skeleton during the precipitation of aragonite by the coral polyps and their ratio is highly temperature dependent. The robustness of this temperature dependence makes Sr\/Ca a reliable proxy for sea surface temperature (SST). Details presented from the St. John S. siderea core indicate that terrestrial inputs of sediment and freshwater can disrupt the chemical balance and subsequently complicate the utility of Sr\/Ca in reconstructing historical SST. An approximately 44-year-long record of Sr\/Ca shows that an annual SST signal is recorded but with an increasing Sr\/Ca trend from 1980 to present, which is likely the result of runoff from the mountainous terrain of St. John. The overwhelming influence of the terrestrial fingerprint on local seawater chemistry makes utilizing Sr\/Ca as a SST proxy in nearshore environments very difficult.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5049f641e4b02b6b9f7bd903"],"contacts":[{"name":"Christopher D.

Understanding the process of coral calcification and establishing baseline calcification rates are necessary to detect future changes in growth resulting from climate change or other stressors. Here we describe the methods used to establish a network of calcification-monitoring stations along the outer Florida Keys Reef Tract in 2009. In addition to detailing the initial setup and periodic monitoring of calcification stations, we discuss the utility and success of our design and offer suggestions for future deployments. Stations were designed such that whole coral colonies were securely attached to fixed apparati (n = 10 at each site) on the seafloor but also could be easily removed and reattached as needed for periodic weighing. Corals were weighed every 6 months, using the buoyant weight technique, to determine calcification rates in situ. Sites were visited in May and November to obtain winter and summer rates, respectively, and identify seasonal patterns in calcification. Calcification rates of the crustose coralline algal community also were measured by affixing commercially available plastic tiles, deployed vertically, at each station. Colonization by invertebrates and fleshy algae on the tiles was low, indicating relative specificity for the crustose coralline algal community. We also describe a new, nonlethal technique for sampling the corals, used following the completion of the monitoring period, in which two slabs were obtained from the center of each colony. Sampled corals were reattached to the seafloor, and most corals had completely recovered within 6 months. The station design and sampling methods described herein provide an effective approach to assessing coral and crustose coralline algal calcification rates across time and space, offering the ability to quantify the potential effects of ocean warming and acidification on calcification processes.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5049f641e4b02b6b9f7bd903"],"contacts":[{"name":"Jennifer M.

We sought to understand the effect of global warming on both beneficial and pest insects of trees. We used urban warming as a proxy for global warming in as much as many cities have already warmed as much, due to heat island effects, as they are expected to warm due to climate change by 2050 or even 2100. We were able to develop good predictive models of how warming influences beneficial and pest insects for cities in the Southeast and across the east coast more generally. We were also able to predict how tree health will respond to these changes in insect communities. In addition, by comparing our results to those we garnered from herbarium specimens (many insects can be found on herbarium specimens) we could show that the effects of urban warming match those of climate change through time. In short, a subset of pests is likely to get far worse with warming and this effect is likely to be most pronounced in the southeast. A second body of work built on these discoveries to consider how to protect trees and forests from the pests that do better with warming.

Here, we used species-specific thermal tolerances to predict the community responses of ant species to experimental forest-floor warming at the northern and southern boundaries of temperate hardwood forests in eastern North America. We then compared the predictive ability of thermal tolerance vs. correlative species distribution models (SDMs) which are popular forecasting tools for modeling the effects of climate change. Thermal tolerances predicted the responses of 19 ant species to experimental climate warming at the southern site, where environmental conditions are relatively close to the ants' upper thermal limits. In contrast, thermal tolerances did not predict the responses of the six species in the northern site, where environmental conditions are relatively far from the ants' upper thermal limits. Correlative SDMs were not predictive at either site. Our results suggest that, in environments close to a species' physiological limits, physiological trait-based measurements can successfully forecast the responses of species to future conditions. Although correlative SDMs may predict large-scale responses, such models may not be accurate for predicting site-level responses.","parentId":"5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3","contacts":[{"name":"Sarah E Diamond","type":"Author","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University; W.

When plants experience more herbivory in these situations it is called associational susceptibility and is most common when herbivores spill from their preferred plant host onto neighboring plants. Cankerworms are common pests of urban trees that have been shown in forests to disperse from preferred to less preferred hosts. I found that two common characteristics of urban habitats, low vegetational diversity and exotic plants, affect cankerworm herbivory of non-host understory plants. In an urban landscape I measured cankerworm herbivory on native dogwood trees growing in the open and below cankerworm host and non-host trees.&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/search?dc.title=Herbivory&amp;facet-content-type=ReferenceWorkEntry&amp;sortOrder=relevance\">Herbivory<\/a>&nbsp;of native dogwoods was ten times greater below cankerworm hosts than on trees below non-hosts or in the open. At an arboretum I measured herbivory of native and exotic plants growing below cankerworm hosts in simple landscape plantings and in natural forests. Associational susceptibility of native dogwoods and&nbsp;<em>Rhododendron<\/em>&nbsp;spp. disappeared when they were growing in complex natural forests even though cankerworm hosts were more abundant. Cankerworms consistently preferred native plant species more than exotic congeners in laboratory experiments. As such, exotic plants experienced very little herbivory regardless of habitat. Herbivorous pests are often more abundant on urban plants than plants in natural habitats. My research shows that, although some plants experience more herbivory when growing near cankerworm hosts, increasing urban habitat complexity could reduce pest damage overall.<\/p> \n <\/div> \n<\/div> \n<div> \n <div> \n  <div>\n   &nbsp;\n  <\/div> \n <\/div> \n<\/div>","parentId":"5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3","contacts":[{"name":"Steven Frank","type":"Author","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11252-014-0368-x","title":"Frank 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"plant diversity"},{"name":"associational resistance"},{"name":"associational susceptibility"},{"name":"vegetational diversity"},{"name":"enemies hypothesis"},{"name":"exotic plants"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-04","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-06-09T15:49:46.762-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-19T11:51:12.776-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2014","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-06-09T15:49:46.762-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-19T11:51:12.776-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["Steven Frank"],"orgs":["Southeast CSC"],"children":[]},"5217c39ae4b0effab1348c18":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/500705fbe4b0abf7ce733fe0","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Clinal variation in colony breeding structure and level of inbreeding in the subterranean termites Reticulitermes flavipes and R. grassei","relatedTitle":"Integrating the Effects of Global and Local Climate Change on Wildlife in North America","id":"5217c39ae4b0effab1348c18","relatedId":"500705fbe4b0abf7ce733fe0","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5217c39ae4b0effab1348c18","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Integrating the Effects of Global and Local Climate Change on Wildlife in North America","relatedTitle":"Clinal variation in colony breeding structure and level of inbreeding in the subterranean termites Reticulitermes flavipes and R. grassei","id":"500705fbe4b0abf7ce733fe0","relatedId":"5217c39ae4b0effab1348c18","annotation":null}]},"id":"5217c39ae4b0effab1348c18","title":"Clinal variation in colony breeding structure and level of inbreeding in the subterranean termites Reticulitermes flavipes and R. grassei","body":"Social insects exhibit remarkable variation in their colony breeding structures, both within and among species. Ecological factors are believed to be important in shaping reproductive traits of social insect colonies, yet there is little information linking specific environmental variables with differences in breeding structure. Subterranean termites (Rhinotermitidae) show exceptional variation in colony breeding structure, differing in the number of reproductives and degree of inbreeding; colonies can be simple families headed by a single pair of monogamous reproductives (king and queen) or they can be extended families headed by multiple inbreeding neotenic reproductives (wingless individuals). Using microsatellite markers, we characterized colony breeding structure and levels of inbreeding in populations over large parts of the range of the subterranean termites&nbsp;\n<em>Reticulitermes flavipes<\/em>&nbsp;in the USA and&nbsp;\n<em>R.&nbsp;grassei<\/em>&nbsp;in Europe. Combining these new data with previous results on populations of both species, we found that latitude had a strong effect on the proportion of extended-family colonies in&nbsp;\n<em>R.&nbsp;flavipes<\/em>&nbsp;and on levels of inbreeding in both species. We examined the effect of several environmental variables that vary latitudinally; while the degree of inbreeding was greatest in cool, moist habitats in both species, seasonality affected the species differently. Inbreeding in&nbsp;\n<em>R.&nbsp;flavipes<\/em>&nbsp;was most strongly associated with climatic variables (mean annual temperature and seasonality), whereas nonclimatic variables, including the availability of wood substrate and soil composition, were important predictors of inbreeding in\n<em>R.&nbsp;grassei<\/em>. These results are the first showing that termite breeding structure is shaped by local environmental factors and that species can vary in their responses to these factors.","parentId":"5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3","contacts":[{"name":"E L Vargo","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"L Leniaud","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"L E Swoboda","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"S E Diamond","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"M D Weiser","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"D M Miller","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"A Bagn\u00e8res-Urbany","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mec.12166\/abstract","title":"Wiley Online Library","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Isoptera"},{"name":"microsatellites"},{"name":"neotenics"},{"name":"population genetics"},{"name":"Rhinotermitidae"},{"name":"social organization"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013-01-07","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-08-23T14:18:34.258-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-19T14:07:12.008-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2013","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-08-23T14:18:34.258-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-19T14:07:12.008-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Molecular Ecology","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Volume","value":"22"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Issue","value":"5"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Pages","value":"1447-1462"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI Number","value":"DOI: 10.1111\/mec.12166"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["E L Vargo","L Leniaud","L E Swoboda","S E Diamond","M D Weiser","D M Miller","A Bagn\u00e8res-Urbany"],"orgs":["Southeast CSC"],"children":[]},"5217c177e4b0effab1348c14":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/500705fbe4b0abf7ce733fe0","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Common garden experiments reveal uncommon responses across temperatures, locations, and species of ants","relatedTitle":"Integrating the Effects of Global and Local Climate Change on Wildlife in North America","id":"5217c177e4b0effab1348c14","relatedId":"500705fbe4b0abf7ce733fe0","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5217c177e4b0effab1348c14","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Integrating the Effects of Global and Local Climate Change on Wildlife in North America","relatedTitle":"Common garden experiments reveal uncommon responses across temperatures, locations, and species of ants","id":"500705fbe4b0abf7ce733fe0","relatedId":"5217c177e4b0effab1348c14","annotation":null}]},"id":"5217c177e4b0effab1348c14","title":"Common garden experiments reveal uncommon responses across temperatures, locations, and species of ants","body":"Population changes and shifts in geographic range boundaries induced by climate change have been documented for many insect species. On the basis of such studies, ecological forecasting models predict that, in the absence of dispersal and resource barriers, many species will exhibit large shifts in abundance and geographic range in response to warming. However, species are composed of individual populations, which may be subject to different selection pressures and therefore may be differentially responsive to environmental change. Asystematic responses across populations and species to warming will alter ecological communities differently across space. Common garden experiments can provide a more mechanistic understanding of the causes of compositional and spatial variation in responses to warming. Such experiments are useful for determining if geographically separated populations and co-occurring species respond differently to warming, and they provide the opportunity to compare effects of warming on fitness (survivorship and reproduction). We exposed colonies of two common ant species in the eastern United States,&nbsp; \n<em>Aphaenogaster rudis<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp; \n<em>Temnothorax curvispinosus<\/em>, collected along a latitudinal gradient from Massachusetts to North Carolina, to growth chamber treatments that simulated current and projected temperatures in central Massachusetts and central North Carolina within the next century. Regardless of source location, colonies of&nbsp; \n<em>A. rudis<\/em>, a keystone seed disperser, experienced high mortality and low brood production in the warmest temperature treatment. Colonies of \n<em>T. curvispinosus<\/em>&nbsp;from cooler locations experienced increased mortality in the warmest rearing temperatures, but colonies from the warmest locales did not. Our results suggest that populations of some common species may exhibit uniform declines in response to warming across their geographic ranges, whereas other species will respond differently to warming in different parts of their geographic ranges. Our results suggest that differential responses of populations and species must be incorporated into projections of range shifts in a changing climate.","parentId":"5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3","contacts":[{"name":"Shannon L Pelini","oldPartyId":57050,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.","firstName":"Shannon","middleName":"L","lastName":"Pelini","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Sarah E Diamond","type":"Author","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Heidi MacLean","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Aaron M Ellison","type":"Author","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Nicholas J Gotelli","type":"Author","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Robert R Dunn","type":"Author","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ece3.407\/abstract","title":"Wiley Online Library","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Climate change"},{"name":"common garden"},{"name":"formicidae"},{"name":"interspecies variation "},{"name":"warming experiment"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2012-12","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-08-23T14:09:27.934-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-07-30T08:26:06.793-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2012","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-08-23T14:09:27.934-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-07-30T08:26:06.793-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Ecology and Evolution ","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Volume ","value":"2"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Issue","value":"12"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Pages","value":"3009-3015"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI Number","value":"10.1002\/ece3.407"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["Shannon L Pelini","Sarah E Diamond","Heidi MacLean","Aaron M Ellison","Nicholas J Gotelli","Robert R Dunn"],"orgs":["Southeast CSC"],"children":[]},"566efb43e4b09cfe53ca7715":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/500705fbe4b0abf7ce733fe0","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Final Memo for Integrating the Effects of Global and Local Climate Change on Wildlife in North America & Tree Eaters: Predicting the Response of Herbivores to the Integrated Effects of Urban and Global Change","relatedTitle":"Integrating the Effects of Global and Local Climate Change on Wildlife in North America","id":"566efb43e4b09cfe53ca7715","relatedId":"500705fbe4b0abf7ce733fe0","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/566efb43e4b09cfe53ca7715","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Integrating the Effects of Global and Local Climate Change on Wildlife in North America","relatedTitle":"Final Memo for Integrating the Effects of Global and Local Climate Change on Wildlife in North America & Tree Eaters: Predicting the Response of Herbivores to the Integrated Effects of Urban and Global Change","id":"500705fbe4b0abf7ce733fe0","relatedId":"566efb43e4b09cfe53ca7715","annotation":null}]},"id":"566efb43e4b09cfe53ca7715","title":"Final Memo for Integrating the Effects of Global and Local Climate Change on Wildlife in North America & Tree Eaters: Predicting the Response of Herbivores to the Integrated Effects of Urban and Global Change","body":"Climate in the southeastern U.S. is predicted to be changing at a slower rate than other parts of North America; however, land use change associated with urbanization is having a significant effect on wildlife populations and habitat availability. We sought to understand the effect of global warming on both beneficial and pest insects of trees. We used urban warming as a proxy for global warming in as much as many cities have already warmed as much, due to heat island effects, as they are expected to warm due to climate change by 2050 or even 2100. We were able to develop good predictive models of how warming influences beneficial and pest insects for cities in the Southeast and across the east coast more generally. We were also able to predict how tree health will respond to these changes in insect communities. In addition, by comparing our results to those we garnered from herbarium specimens (many insects can be found on herbarium specimens) we could show that the effects of urban warming match those of climate change through time. In short, a subset of pests is likely to get far worse with warming and this effect is likely to be most pronounced in the southeast. A second body of work built on these discoveries to consider how to protect trees and forests from the pests that do better with warming. Work continues to be focused on the importance of which trees are present (or planted) and the diversity of those trees.","parentId":"5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3","contacts":[{"name":"Robb

services to city residents, but their management is hindered by a poor understanding of their ecology. We examined a novel ecosystem service relevant to urban public health and esthetics: the consumption of littered food waste by arthropods. Theory and data from natural systems suggest that the magnitude and resilience of this service should increase with biological diversity. We measured food removal by presenting known quantities of cookies, potato chips, and hot dogs in street medians (24 sites) and parks (21 sites) in New York City, USA. At the same sites, we assessed ground-arthropod diversity and abiotic conditions, including history of flooding during Hurricane Sandy 7 months prior to the study. Arthropod diversity was greater in parks (on average 11 hexapod families and 4.7 ant species per site), than in medians (nine hexapod families and 2.7 ant species per site). However, counter to our diversity-based prediction, arthropods in medians removed 2-3 times more food per day than did those in parks. We detected no effect of flooding (at 19 sites) on this service. Instead, greater food removal was associated with the presence of the introduced pavement ant (Tetramorium sp. E) and with hotter, drier conditions that may have increased arthropod metabolism. When vertebrates also had access to food, more was removed, indicating that arthropods and vertebrates compete for littered food. We estimate that arthropods alone could remove 4-6.5 kg of food per year in a single street median, reducing its availability to less desirable fauna such as rats. Our results suggest that species identity and habitat may be more relevant than diversity for predicting urban ecosystem services. Even small green spaces such as street medians provide ecosystem services that may complement those of larger habitat patches across the urban landscape.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> \n<strong>This publication was developed as a part of the project,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/display-project\/4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c\/526ebc60e4b044919baf138e\">Tree Eaters: Predicting the Response of Herbivores to the Integrated Effects of Urban and Global Change<\/a>.<\/strong>\n<br \/> \n<br \/> Read the North Carolina State University's press release on this publication \n<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/news.ncsu.edu\/2014\/12\/youngsteadt-eat-nyc\/\">here<\/a><\/strong>.&nbsp;","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","linkParentIds":["5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3"],"contacts":[{"name":"Elsa Youngsteadt","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Ryanna C.

High-throughput sequencing of microbial communities supports multiplexed sampling for statistically robust tests of hypotheses about symbiotic associations. We focus on ambrosia beetles, the increasingly damaging insects primarily associated with fungal symbionts, which have also been reported to support bacteria. To analyze the diversity, composition, and specificity of the beetles\u2019 prokaryotic associates, we combine global sampling, insect anatomy, 454 sequencing of bacterial&nbsp;\n<a href=\"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/search?dc.title=rDNA&amp;facet-content-type=ReferenceWorkEntry&amp;sortOrder=relevance\">rDNA<\/a>, and multivariate statistics to analyze prokaryotic communities in ambrosia beetle mycangia, organs mostly known for transporting symbiotic fungi. We analyze six beetle species that represent three types of mycangia and include several globally distributed species, some with major economic importance (\n<em>Dendroctonus frontalis<\/em>,\n<em>Xyleborus affinis<\/em>,&nbsp;\n<em>Xyleborus bispinatus\u2013ferrugineus<\/em>,&nbsp;\n<em>Xyleborus glabratus<\/em>,&nbsp;\n<em>Xylosandrus crassiusculus<\/em>, and&nbsp;\n<em>Xylosandrus germanus<\/em>). Ninety-six beetle mycangia yielded 1,546 bacterial phylotypes. Several phylotypes appear to form the core microbiome of the mycangium. Three\n<em>Mycoplasma<\/em>&nbsp;(originally thought restricted to vertebrates), two Burkholderiales, and two Pseudomonadales are repeatedly present worldwide in multiple beetle species. However, no bacterial phylotypes were universally present, suggesting that ambrosia beetles are not obligately dependent on bacterial symbionts. The composition of bacterial communities is structured by the host beetle species more than by the locality of origin, which suggests that more bacteria are vertically transmitted than acquired from the environment. The invasive&nbsp;\n<em>X<\/em>.&nbsp;\n<em>glabratus<\/em>&nbsp;and the globally distributed&nbsp;\n<em>X<\/em>.&nbsp;\n<em>crassiusculus<\/em>&nbsp;have unique sets of bacteria, different from species native to North America.

For ectothermic animals, there is systematic latitudinal variation in the relationship between climate and thermal performance curves, which describe the relationship between temperature and an organism's fitness. Here, we ask whether these documented latitudinal patterns can be generalized to predict arthropod responses to warming across mid- and high temperate latitudes, for taxa whose thermal physiology has not been measured. To address this question, we used a novel natural experiment consisting of a series of urban warming gradients at different latitudes. Specifically, we sampled arthropods from a single common street tree species across temperature gradients in four US cities, located from 35.8 to 42.4\u00b0 latitude. We captured 6746 arthropods in 34 families from 111 sites that varied in summer average temperature by 1.7\u20133.4&nbsp;\u00b0C within each city. Arthropod responses to warming within each city were characterized as Poisson regression coefficients describing change in abundance per \u00b0C for each family. Family responses in the two midlatitude cities were heterogeneous, including significantly negative and positive effects, while those in high-latitude cities varied no more than expected by chance within each city. We expected high-latitude taxa to increase in abundance with warming, and they did so in one of the two high-latitude cities; in the other, Queens (New York City), most taxa declined with warming, perhaps due to habitat loss that was correlated with warming in this city. With the exception of Queens, patterns of family responses to warming were consistent with predictions based on known latitudinal patterns in arthropod physiology relative to regional climate. Heterogeneous responses in midlatitudes may be ecologically disruptive if interacting taxa respond oppositely to warming.","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","linkParentIds":["5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3","55fb1b80e4b05d6c4e501c10"],"contacts":[{"name":"Elsa Youngsteadt","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Andrew F.

Though largely ignored to date, these coextinctions can pose threats to human health by altering the composition, quantity and distribution of zoonotic parasites. We simulated host extinctions from more than 1300 host\u2013parasite associations for 29 North American carnivores to investigate changes in parasite composition and species richness. We also explored the geography of zoonotic parasite richness under three carnivore composition scenarios and examined corresponding levels of human exposure. We found that changes in parasite assemblages differed among parasite groups. Because viruses tend to be generalists, the proportion of parasites that are viruses increased as more carnivores went extinct. Coextinction of carnivore parasites is unlikely to be common, given that few specialist parasites exploit hosts of conservation concern. However, local extirpations of widespread carnivore hosts can reduce overall zoonotic richness and shift distributions of parasite-rich areas. How biodiversity influences disease risks remains the subject of debate. Our results make clear that hosts vary in their contribution to human health risks. As a consequence, so too does the loss (or gain) of particular hosts. Anticipating changes in host composition in future environments may help inform parasite conservation and disease mitigation efforts.","parentId":"5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3","contacts":[{"name":"Nyeema C.

Other dynamics, such as disturbance history, may prompt species distribution shifts resembling those expected from rapid climate change. Links between species distributions, regional climate trends and physiological mechanism are needed to convincingly establish climate-induced species shifts. We examine a 38-year shift (1974\u20132012) in an elevation ecotone between two closely related ant species,&nbsp;\n<em>Aphaenogaster picea<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;\n<em>A. rudis<\/em>. Even though&nbsp;\n<em>A. picea<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;\n<em>A. rudis<\/em>&nbsp;are closely related with North American distributions that sometimes overlap, they also exhibit local- and regional-scale differences in temperature requirements so that&nbsp;\n<em>A. rudis<\/em>&nbsp;is more southerly and inhabits lower elevations whereas&nbsp;\n<em>A. picea<\/em>&nbsp;is more northerly and inhabits high elevations. We find considerable movement by the warm-habitat species upward in elevation between 1974 and 2012 with&nbsp;\n<em>A. rudis<\/em>, replacing the cold-habitat species,&nbsp;\n<em>A. picea<\/em>, along the southern edge of the Appalachian Mountain chain in north Georgia, USA. Concomitant with the distribution shifts, regional mean and maximum temperatures remain steady (1974\u20132012), but minimum temperatures increase. We collect individuals from the study sites and subject them to thermal tolerance testing in a controlled setting and find that maximum and minimum temperature acclimatization occurs along the elevation gradient in both species, but&nbsp;\n<em>A. rudis<\/em>&nbsp;consistently becomes physiologically incapacitated at minimum and maximum temperatures 2&nbsp;&deg;C higher than&nbsp;\n<em>A. picea<\/em>. These results indicate that rising minimum temperatures allow&nbsp;\n<em>A. rudis<\/em>&nbsp;to move upward in elevation and displace&nbsp;\n<em>A. picea<\/em>. Given that&nbsp;\n<em>Aphaenogaster<\/em>&nbsp;ants are the dominant woodland seed dispersers in eastern deciduous forests, and that their thermal tolerances drive distinct differences in temperature-cued synchrony with early blooming plants, these climate responses not only impact ant-ant interactions, but might have wide implications for ant-plant interactions.","parentId":"5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3","contacts":[{"name":"Robert J.

Using a unique, citywide, factorial experiment, we investigated how warming and insect herbivory affected physiological function and carbon sequestration (carbon stored per year) of mature trees. Urban warming increased herbivorous arthropod abundance on trees, but these herbivores had negligible effects on tree carbon sequestration. Instead, urban warming was associated with an estimated 12% loss of carbon sequestration, in part because photosynthesis was reduced at hotter sites. Ecosystem service assessments that do not consider urban conditions may overestimate urban tree carbon storage. Because urban and global warming are becoming more intense, our results suggest that urban trees will sequester even less carbon in the future.","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","linkParentIds":["55fb1b80e4b05d6c4e501c10","5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3"],"contacts":[{"name":"The Royal Society","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Emily Meineke","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Elsa Youngsteadt","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Robert R.

Unfortunately, herbivorous arthropod pests are often more abundant on urban than rural trees, reducing tree growth, survival, and ecosystem services. Previous research where vegetation complexity was reduced has attributed elevated urban pest abundance to decreased regulation by natural enemies. However, reducing vegetation complexity, particularly the density of overstory trees, also makes cities hotter than natural habitats. We ask how urban habitat characteristics influence an abiotic factor, temperature, and a biotic factor, natural enemy abundance, in regulating the abundance of an urban forest pest, the gloomy scale, (Melanaspis tenebricosa). We used a map of surface temperature to select red maple trees (Acer rubrum) at warmer and cooler sites in Raleigh, NC. We quantified habitat complexity by measuring impervious surface cover, local vegetation structural complexity, and landscape scale vegetation cover around each tree. Using path analysis, we determined that impervious surface (the most important habitat variable) increased scale insect abundance by increasing tree canopy temperature, rather than by reducing natural enemy abundance or percent parasitism. As a mechanism for this response, we found that increasing temperature significantly increases scale insect fecundity and contributes to greater population increase. Specifically, adult female M. tenebricosa egg sets increased by approximately fourteen eggs for every 1&deg; C increase in temperature. Climate change models predict that the global climate will increase by 2-3&deg; C in the next 50-100 years, which we found would increase scale insect abundance by three orders of magnitude. This result supports predictions that urban and natural forests will face greater herbivory in the future, and suggests that a primary cause could be direct, positive effects of warming on herbivore fitness rather than altered trophic interactions.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> Copyright by the Ecological Society of America\n<br \/> \n<br \/> Read More:&nbsp;\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.esajournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1890\/13-1961.1\">http:\/\/www.esajournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1890\/13-1961.1<\/a>","parentId":"5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3","contacts":[{"name":"Adam G.

Here we ask how urbanization affects the immune response and pathogen load of feral and managed colonies of honey bees ( \n<em>Apis mellifera<\/em>&nbsp;Linnaeus), the predominant economically important pollinator worldwide. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we measured expression of 4 immune genes and relative abundance of 10 honey bee pathogens. We also measured worker survival in a laboratory bioassay. We found that pathogen pressure on honey bees increased with urbanization and management, and the probability of worker survival declined 3-fold along our urbanization gradient. The effect of management on pathogens appears to be mediated by immunity, with feral bees expressing immune genes at nearly twice the levels of managed bees following an immune challenge. The effect of urbanization, however, was not linked with immunity; instead, urbanization may favor viability and transmission of some disease agents. Feral colonies, with lower disease burdens and stronger immune responses, may illuminate ways to improve honey bee management. The previously unexamined effects of urbanization on honey-bee disease are concerning, suggesting that urban areas may favor problematic diseases of pollinators.","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","linkParentIds":["5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3"],"contacts":[{"name":"Elsa Youngsteadt","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"R.

Because ants are geographically widespread, ecologically diverse, and thermophilic, they are an ideal system for exploring the extent to which physiological tolerance can predict responses to environmental change. Here, we expand on simple models that use thermal tolerance to predict the responses of ants to climatic warming. We investigated the degree to which changes in the abundance of ants under warming reflect reductions in the thermal niche space for their foraging. In an eastern deciduous forest system in the United States with approximately 40 ant species, we found that for some species, the loss of thermal niche space for foraging was related to decreases in abundance with increasing experimental climatic warming. However, many ant species exhibited no loss of thermal niche space. For one well-studied species,&nbsp;\n<em>Temnothorax curvispinosus<\/em>, we examined both survival of workers and growth of colonies (a correlate of reproductive output) as functions of temperature in the laboratory, and found that the range of thermal tolerances for colony growth was much narrower than for survival of workers. We evaluated these functions in the context of experimental climatic warming and found that the difference in the responses of these two attributes to temperature generates differences in the means and especially the variances of expected fitness under warming. The expected mean growth of colonies was optimized at intermediate levels of warming (2\u20134&deg;C above ambient); yet, the expected variance monotonically increased with warming. In contrast, the expected mean and variance of the survival of workers decreased when warming exceeded 4&deg;C above ambient. Together, these results for&nbsp;\n<em>T. curvispinosus<\/em>&nbsp;emphasize the importance of measuring reproduction (colony growth) in the context of climatic change: indeed, our examination of the loss of thermal niche space with the larger species pool could be missing much of the warming impact due to these analyses being based on survival rather than reproduction. We suggest that while physiological tolerance of temperature can be a useful predictive tool for modeling responses to climatic change, future efforts should be devoted to understanding the causes and consequences of variability in models of tolerance calibrated with different metrics of performance and fitness.","parentId":"5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3","contacts":[{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Sarah E Diamond","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Clint A Penick","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Shannon L Pelini","oldPartyId":57050,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.","firstName":"Shannon","middleName":"L","lastName":"Pelini","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Aaron M Ellison","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Nicholas J Gotelli","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Nathan J Sanders","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Robert R Dunn","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/icb.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/07\/26\/icb.ict085.abstract","title":"Abstract","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"ants"},{"name":"climate change"},{"name":"physiology"},{"name":"temperature"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013-11","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-12-19T08:03:53.727-07:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-23T14:17:39.772-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2013","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-12-19T08:03:53.727-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-23T14:17:39.772-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Integrative and Comparative Biology","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["Sarah E Diamond","Clint A Penick","Shannon L Pelini","Aaron M Ellison","Nicholas J Gotelli","Nathan J Sanders","Robert R Dunn"],"orgs":["Southeast CSC"],"children":[]},"516c54fce4b0eae401aec44e":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/500705fbe4b0abf7ce733fe0","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Who likes it hot?

A global analysis of the climatic, ecological, and evolutionary determinants of warming tolerance in ants","body":"Effects of climate warming on wild populations of organisms are expected to be greatest at higher latitudes, paralleling greater anticipated increases in temperature in these regions. Yet, these expectations assume that populations in different regions are equally susceptible to the effects of warming. This is unlikely to be the case. Here, we develop a series of predictive models for physiological thermal tolerances in ants based on current and future climates. We found that tropical ants have lower warming tolerances, a metric of susceptibility to climate warming, than temperate ants despite greater increases in temperature at higher latitudes. Using climatic, ecological and phylogenetic data, we refine our predictions of which ants (across all regions) were most susceptible to climate warming. We found that ants occupying warmer and more mesic forested habitats at lower elevations are the most physiologically susceptible to deleterious effects of climate warming. Phylogenetic history was also a strong indicator of physiological susceptibility. In short, we find that ants that live in the canopies of hot, tropical forest are the most at risk, globally, from climate warming. Unfortunately this is where many, perhaps most, ant and other species on Earth live.","parentId":"5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3","contacts":[{"name":"Sarah E.

Unfortunately, many of these ecosystems are increasingly under threat due to rapid human development, and management agencies are increasingly aware of the potential effects that climate change will have on these ecosystems. Natural resource managers and conservation planners can be effective at preserving ecosystems in the face of these stressors only if they can adapt current conservation efforts to increase the overall resilience of the system. Climate change, in particular, challenges many of the basic assumptions used by conservation planners and managers. Previous conservation planning efforts identified and prioritized areas for conservation based on the current environmental conditions, such as habitat quality, and assumed that conditions in conservation lands would be largely controlled by management actions (including no action). Climate change, however, will likely alter important system drivers (temperature, precipitation, and sea-level rise) and make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain recent historic conditions in conservation lands into the future. Climate change will also influence the future conservation potential of non-conservation lands, further complicating conservation planning. Therefore, there is a need to develop and adapt effective conservation strategies to cope with the effects of climate and landscape change on future environmental conditions<\/div>\n","parentId":"5006f8e9e4b0abf7ce733fc9","contacts":[{"name":"Adam J Terando","oldPartyId":62231,"type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"aterando@usgs.gov","active":true,"firstName":"Adam","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Terando","organization":{"displayText":"National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center and Climate Science Centers"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9195155327","streetAddress":{"zip":"27695","country":"US","city":"Raleigh","state":"NC","line1":"NC State University, 100 Eugene Brooks Ave, 127 David Clark Labs"},"buildingCode":"AVD","name":"Adam J Terando\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

The SAMBI DSL project used predicted urban growth models described herein to inform future landscape conditions that were also based climate change impacts and vegetative community succession. These future landscape conditions were then applied as a context for land use and management decisions in conservation planning.<\/p> \n<p>SLEUTH, named for the model input datasets (Slope, Land use, Excluded, Urban, Transportation and Hillshade) is the evolutionary product of the Clarke Urban Growth Model that uses cellular automata, terrain mapping and land cover change modeling to address urban growth (Jantz et al, 2009; NCGIA 2011). SLEUTH provides urban growth projections which are useful across a range of applications; including wildlife habitat analysis, conservation planning, and land cover dynamics analysis. SLEUTH incorporates four growth rules (Spontaneous Growth, New Spreading Centers, Edge Growth and Road-Influenced Growth) to model the rate and pattern of urbanization. The model simulates not only outward growth of existing urban areas, but also growth along transportation corridors and new centers of urbanization. SLEUTH incorporates five parameters (Dispersion, Breed, Spread, Slope and Road Gravity) into the growth rules which project future urbanization. Possible parameter coefficient values range between 1 and 100. During calibration every possible combination of these five parameter coefficients (between defined start and stop values and by a defined step size) is applied to the growth rules, in order to find the combination that best matches past urbanization patterns observed in the training data. Once found, the model is run in prediction mode using these parameter values in the growth rules. The model produces one urban growth cycle per year. For each growth cycle, a GIF image is produced showing the probability of urbanization for each pixel.<\/p> \n<p>This project utilized the SLEUTH-3r version of the model taking advantage of added new functionality and substantially increased performance (Jantz et al. 2009) over previous versions.<\/p>","parentId":"54c687a9e4b043905e019a84","contacts":[{"name":"Curtis M.

Landscape change estimates are characterized by classification errors. Researchers have used error matrices to adjust estimates of areal extent, but estimation of land cover change is more difficult and more challenging, with error in classification being confused with change. We modeled land cover dynamics for a discrete set of habitat states. The approach accounts for state uncertainty to produce unbiased estimates of habitat transition probabilities using ground information to inform error rates. We consider the case when true and observed habitat states are available for the same geographic unit (pixel) and when true and observed states are obtained at one level of resolution, but transition probabilities estimated at a different level of resolution (aggregations of pixels). Simulation results showed a strong bias when estimating transition probabilities if misclassification was not accounted for. Scaling-up does not necessarily decrease the bias and can even increase it. Analyses of land cover data in the Southeast region of the USA showed that land change patterns appeared distorted if misclassification was not accounted for: rate of habitat turnover was artificially increased and habitat composition appeared more homogeneous. Not properly accounting for land cover misclassification can produce misleading inferences about habitat state and dynamics and also misleading predictions about species distributions based on habitat. Our models that explicitly account for state uncertainty should be useful in obtaining more accurate inferences about change from data that include errors.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5049fa6be4b02b6b9f7bd914","54c687a2e4b043905e019a82"],"contacts":[{"name":"Sophie Veran","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Kevin J.

Purported relationships describe the initial state of knowledge, but are rarely tested. We assessed support in the data for suitability rankings of vegetation types based on expert knowledge for three terrestrial avian species in the South Atlantic Coastal Plain of the United States. Experts used published studies, natural history, survey data, and field experience to rank vegetation types as optimal, suitable, and marginal. We used single-season occupancy models, coupled with land cover and Breeding Bird Survey data, to examine the hypothesis that patterns of occupancy conformed to species-habitat suitability rankings purported by experts. Purported habitat suitability was validated for two of three species. As predicted for the Eastern Wood-Pewee (\n<em>Contopus virens<\/em>) and Brown-headed Nuthatch (\n<em>Sitta pusilla<\/em>), occupancy was strongly influenced by vegetation types classified as \u201coptimal habitat\u201d by the species suitability rankings for nuthatches and wood-pewees. Contrary to predictions, Red-headed Woodpecker (\n<em>Melanerpes erythrocephalus<\/em>) models that included vegetation types as covariates received similar support by the data as models without vegetation types. For all three species, occupancy was also related to sampling latitude. Our results suggest that covariates representing other habitat requirements might be necessary to model occurrence of generalist species like the woodpecker.

level rise","body":"Sea level rise during the 21st century will have a wide range of effects on coastal environments, human development, and infrastructure in coastal areas. The broad range of complex factors influencing coastal systems contributes to large uncertainties in predicting long-term sea level rise impacts. Here we explore and demonstrate the capabilities of a Bayesian network (BN) to predict long-term shoreline change associated with sea level rise and make quantitative assessments of prediction uncertainty. A BN is used to define relationships between driving forces, geologic constraints, and coastal response for the U.S. Atlantic coast that include observations of local rates of relative sea level rise, wave height, tide range, geomorphic classification, coastal slope, and shoreline change rate. The BN is used to make probabilistic predictions of shoreline retreat in response to different future sea level rise rates. Results demonstrate that the probability of shoreline retreat increases with higher rates of sea level rise. Where more specific information is included, the probability of shoreline change increases in a number of cases, indicating more confident predictions. A hindcast evaluation of the BN indicates that the network correctly predicts 71% of the cases. Evaluation of the results using Brier skill and log likelihood ratio scores indicates that the network provides shoreline change predictions that are better than the prior probability. Shoreline change outcomes indicating stability (\u22121 &lt; rate &lt; 1 m\/yr) or erosion (rate &lt; \u22121 m\/yr) tend to occur for two sets of input scenarios. Stable shoreline change rates occur mainly for low rates of relative sea level rise and occur in low-vulnerability geomorphic settings. Rates indicating erosion result for cases where the rate of relative sea level rise is high and moderate-to-high vulnerability geomorphic settings occur. In contrast, accretion (rate &gt; 1 m\/yr) was not well predicted. We find that BNs can assimilate important factors contributing to coastal change in response to sea level rise and can make quantitative, probabilistic predictions that can be applied to coastal management decisions.","parentId":"54c68903e4b043905e019aa4","contacts":[{"name":"Gutierrez, Benjamin T.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Plant, Nathaniel G.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Thieler, E.

The research team implemented a three-part plan to provide high resolution climate data for the impact modeling community. First, a database was developed of up-to-date and state-of-the-art downscaled climate projections for the U.S., using a range of plausible future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Second, a series of workshops were held to solicit input about climate-related data needs and to discuss best practices for accessing and using downscaled climate projections. Finally, downscaled projections are now being made available as an enterprise-level web-based source. Users are able to freely access the data via an interactive, easily manageable interface, in formats which are familiar to ecosystem and impact modelers. The work enables impact assessments to be based on the same common data set, allowing researchers and resource managers to compare results and projections across regions and ecosystems.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nAdditionally, a research team also developed the core climatic datasets necessary to project regional ecosystem impacts resulting from 21st century climate change. They adhered to an approach that carefully assessed and propagated model uncertainty, downscaled climate projections to the scale of important ecosystem processes, and focused on the most impact-relevant climatic variables. They worked on addressing three questions: (1) What is the magnitude and direction of climate change expected in the U.S. Southeast over the next 100 years? (2) How do the projected changes in climate relate to those parameters that most affect ecosystem processes specific to the Southeast? and (3) What is the level of uncertainty associated these

statistical downscaling of daily climate variables","body":"The asynchronous regional regression model (ARRM) is a flexible and computationally efficient statistical model that can downscale station-based or gridded daily values of any variable that can be transformed into an approximately symmetric distribution and for which a large-scale predictor exists. This technique was developed to bridge the gap between large-scale outputs from atmosphere\u2013ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) and the fine-scale output required for local and regional climate impact assessments. ARRM uses piecewise regression to quantify the relationship between observed and modelled quantiles and then downscale future projections. Here, we evaluate the performance of three successive versions of the model in downscaling daily minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation for 20 stations in North America from diverse climate zones. Using cross-validation to maximize the independent comparison period, historical downscaled simulations are evaluated relative to observations in terms of three different quantities: the probability distributions, giving a visual image of the skill of each model; root-mean-square errors; and bias in nine quantiles that represent both means and extremes. Successive versions of the model show improved accuracy in simulating extremes, where AOGCMs are often most biased and which are frequently the focus of impact studies. Overall, the quantile regression-based technique is shown to be efficient, robust, and highly generalizable across multiple variables, regions, and climate model inputs.","parentId":"54c68981e4b043905e019ac6","contacts":[{"name":"Stoner, Anne M.

A key problem is how to combine the information contained in large-scale observational data sets with simulations of Earth system models in a statistically sound and computationally tractable manner. Here, we describe a statistical approach for improving projections of the North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). The AMOC is part of the global ocean conveyor belt circulation and transfers heat between low and high latitudes in the Atlantic basin. The AMOC might collapse in a \u201ctipping point\u201d response to anthropogenic climate forcings. Assessing the risk of an AMOC collapse is of considerable interest because it may result in major impacts on natural and human systems. AMOC projections rely on simulations from complex climate models. One key source of uncertainty in AMOC projections is uncertainty about background ocean vertical diffusivity (\n<em>K<\/em>v), an important model parameter.&nbsp;\n<em>K<\/em>v&nbsp;cannot be directly observed but can be inferred by combining climate model output with observations on the oceans (so-called tracers). Here, we combine information from multiple tracers, each observed on a spatial grid. Our two-stage approach emulates the computationally expensive climate model using a flexible hierarchical model to connect the tracers. We then infer&nbsp;\n<em>K<\/em>v&nbsp;using our emulator and the observations via a Bayesian approach, accounting for observation error and model discrepancy. We utilize kernel mixing and matrix identities in our Gaussian process model to considerably reduce the computational burdens imposed by the large data sets. We find that our approach is flexible, reduces identifiability issues, and enables inference about&nbsp;\n<em>K<\/em>vbased on large data sets. We use the resulting inference about&nbsp;\n<em>K<\/em>v&nbsp;to improve probabilistic projections of the AMOC.

Compared to station and gridded observations, nearly every CMIP5, CMIP3 and AMIP5 simulation tends to reproduce the primary inter-regional features of the Caribbean annual temperature cycle. In most coupled model simulations, however, boreal summer temperature lags observations by about 1&nbsp;month, with a similar lag in the simulated annual cycle of sea surface temperature (SST), and a systematic cold bias in both climatological annual mean air temperature and SST. There is some improvement from CMIP3 to CMIP5 but the bias is still marked compared to AMIP5 and observations, implying that biases in the annual temperature cycle may originate in the ocean component of the coupled models. This also suggests a tendency for models to over-emphasize the influence of SSTs on near-surface temperature, a bias that may be exacerbated by model tendency to over-estimate ocean mixed layer depth as well. In contrast, we find that both coupled and atmosphere-only models tend to reasonably simulate the response of observed temperature to global temperature, to regional and large-scale variability across the Caribbean region and the Gulf of Mexico, and even to more remote Atlantic and Pacific influences. These findings contribute to building confidence in the ability of coupled models to simulate the effect of global-scale change on the Caribbean.","parentId":"54c68981e4b043905e019ac6","contacts":[{"name":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jung-Hee Ryu","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Katharine Hayhoe","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00382-014-2351-x","title":"Abstract Text Link","hidden":false},{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00382-014-2351-x\/fulltext.html","title":"Full Text Link","hidden":false},{"type":"pdf","typeLabel":"PDF Download","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00382-014-2351-x.pdf","title":"Publication PDF","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Geophysics"},{"name":"climatology"},{"name":"Oceanography"},{"name":"caribbean surface temperature"},{"name":"sea surface temperatures"},{"name":"climate and teleconnection indices"},{"name":"oceanic mixed layer depth"},{"name":"coupled climate models"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-10-04","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-02-09T13:25:12.107-07:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-23T13:00:10.137-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2014","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-02-09T13:25:12.107-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-23T13:00:10.137-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Climate Dynamics","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"startPage","value":"1"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"endPage","value":"21"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1007\/s00382-014-2351-x"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issn","value":"0930-7575"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["Jung-Hee Ryu","Katharine Hayhoe"],"orgs":["Springer Berlin Heidelberg","Southeast CSC"],"children":[]},"54dd1350e4b08de9379b2f5a":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/54c2c0fbe4b043905e018549","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"The Practitioner's Dilemma: How to Assess the Credibility of Downscaled Climate Projections","relatedTitle":"SERAP:  Comprehensive Web-based Climate Change Projections: Downscaled Maps and Data","id":"54dd1350e4b08de9379b2f5a","relatedId":"54c2c0fbe4b043905e018549","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/54dd1350e4b08de9379b2f5a","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"SERAP:  Comprehensive Web-based Climate Change Projections: Downscaled Maps and Data","relatedTitle":"The Practitioner's Dilemma: How to Assess the Credibility of Downscaled Climate Projections","id":"54c2c0fbe4b043905e018549","relatedId":"54dd1350e4b08de9379b2f5a","annotation":null}]},"id":"54dd1350e4b08de9379b2f5a","title":"The Practitioner's Dilemma: How to Assess the Credibility of Downscaled Climate Projections","body":"Suppose you are a city planner, regional water manager, or wildlife conservation specialist who is asked to include the potential impacts of climate variability and change in your risk management and planning efforts.

Stakeholder decisions about critical infrastructures, natural resources, emergency preparedness and humanitarian aid typically need to be made at local to regional scales over seasonal to decadal planning horizons. However, credible climate change attribution and reliable projections at more localized and shorter time scales remain grand challenges. Long-standing gaps include inadequate understanding of processes such as cloud physics and ocean\u2013land\u2013atmosphere interactions, limitations of physics-based computer models, and the importance of intrinsic climate system variability at decadal horizons. Meanwhile, the growing size and complexity of climate data from model simulations and remote sensors increases opportunities to address these scientific gaps. This perspectives article explores the possibility that physically cognizant mining of massive climate data may lead to significant advances in generating credible predictive insights about climate extremes and in turn translating them to actionable metrics and information for adaptation and policy. Specifically, we propose that data mining techniques geared towards extremes can help tackle the grand challenges in the development of interpretable climate projections, predictability, and uncertainty assessments. To be successful, scalable methods will need to handle what has been called \u201cbig data\u201d to tease out elusive but robust statistics of extremes and change from what is ultimately small data. Physically based relationships (where available) and conceptual understanding (where appropriate) are needed to guide methods development and interpretation of results. Such approaches may be especially relevant in situations where computer models may not be able to fully encapsulate current process understanding, yet the wealth of data may offer additional insights. Large-scale interdisciplinary team efforts, involving domain experts and individual researchers who span disciplines, will be necessary to address the challenge.","parentId":"54c68981e4b043905e019ac6","contacts":[{"name":"Copernicus GmbH","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Ganguly, A.

Landscapes Project","body":"<p>In the Southeastern U.S. rapid urbanization is a major challenge to developing long-term conservation strategies. The SAMBI DSL project used predicted urban growth models described herein to inform future landscape conditions that were also based climate change impacts and vegetative community succession. These future landscape conditions were then applied as a context for land use and management decisions in conservation planning.<\/p> \n<p>SLEUTH, named for the model input datasets (Slope, Land use, Excluded, Urban, Transportation and Hillshade) is the evolutionary product of the Clarke Urban Growth Model that uses cellular automata, terrain mapping and land cover change modeling to address urban growth (Jantz et al, 2009; NCGIA 2011). SLEUTH provides urban growth projections which are useful across a range of applications; including wildlife habitat analysis, conservation planning, and land cover dynamics analysis. SLEUTH incorporates four growth rules (Spontaneous Growth, New Spreading Centers, Edge Growth and Road-Influenced Growth) to model the rate and pattern of urbanization. The model simulates not only outward growth of existing urban areas, but also growth along transportation corridors and new centers of urbanization. SLEUTH incorporates five parameters (Dispersion, Breed, Spread, Slope and Road Gravity) into the growth rules which project future urbanization. Possible parameter coefficient values range between 1 and 100. During calibration every possible combination of these five parameter coefficients (between defined start and stop values and by a defined step size) is applied to the growth rules, in order to find the combination that best matches past urbanization patterns observed in the training data. Once found, the model is run in prediction mode using these parameter values in the growth rules. The model produces one urban growth cycle per year. For each growth cycle, a GIF image is produced showing the probability of urbanization for each pixel.<\/p> \n<p>This project utilized the SLEUTH-3r version of the model taking advantage of added new functionality and substantially increased performance (Jantz et al. 2009) over previous versions.<\/p>","parentId":"54c689d5e4b043905e019ad7","contacts":[{"name":"Curtis M.

Here, we use scenarios of climate change, urbanization and management to simulate the future dynamics of the critically endangered and fire-dependent longleaf pine (\n<em>Pinus palustris<\/em>) ecosystem. We investigated how climate change and urbanization will affect the ecosystem, and whether the two conservation goals of a 135% increase in total longleaf area and a doubling of fire-maintained open-canopy habitat can be achieved in the face of these drivers. Our results show that while climatic warming had little effect on the wildfire regime, and thus on longleaf pine dynamics, urban growth led to an 8% reduction in annual wildfire area. The management scenarios we tested increase the ecosystem's total extent by up to 62% and result in expansion of open-canopy longleaf by as much as 216%, meeting one of the two conservation goals for the ecosystem. We find that both conservation goals for this ecosystem, which is climate-resilient but vulnerable to urbanization, are only attainable if a greater focus is placed on restoration of non-longleaf areas as opposed to maintaining existing longleaf stands. Our approach demonstrates the importance of accounting for multiple relevant anthropogenic threats in an ecosystem-specific context in order to facilitate more effective management actions.","parentId":"54c689cee4b043905e019ad5","contacts":[{"name":"Jennifer K.

The SPB has a considerable effect on forest dynamics in the Southeastern United States, especially in loblolly pine (\n<em>Pinus taeda<\/em>) stands that are managed for timber production. Regional outbreaks of SPB occur in bursts resulting in elimination of entire stands and major economic loss. These outbreaks are often interspersed with decades of inactivity, making long-term modeling of SPB dynamics challenging. Forest management techniques, including thinning, have proven effective and are often recommended as a way to prevent SPB attack, yet the robustness of current management practices to long-term SPB dynamics has not been examined. We used data from previously documented SPB infestations and forest inventory data to model four scenarios of SPB dynamics and pine forest management. We incorporated two levels of beetle pressure: a background low level, and a higher level in which SPB had the potential to spread among pine stands. For each level of beetle pressure, we modeled two scenarios of forest management: one assuming forests would be managed continuously via thinning, and one with a reduction in thinning. For our study area in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama, we found that beetle pressure and forest management both influenced the landscape effects of SPB. Under increased SPB pressure, even with continuous management, the area of pine forests affected across the region was six times greater than under baseline SPB levels. However, under high SPB pressure, continuous management decreased the area affected by nearly half compared with reduced management. By incorporating a range of forest and SPB dynamics over long time scales, our results extend previous modeling studies, and inform forest managers and policy-makers about the potential future effects of SPB. Our model can also be used to investigate the effects of additional scenarios on SPB dynamics, such as alternative management or climate change.","parentId":"54c689cee4b043905e019ad5","contacts":[{"name":"Jennifer K.

While the upper and middle Chattahoochee River basins within the Southeastern United States Piedmont contain few natural lakes, they have a high density of small reservoirs (more than 7500 small reservoirs in the nearly 12,000 km2 basin). Policymakers and water managers in the region have little information about small reservoir distribution, uses, or the cumulative inundation of land cover caused by small reservoir construction. Examination of aerial photography reveals the spatiotemporal patterns and extent of small reservoir construction from 1950 to 2010. Over that 60 year timeframe, the area inundated by water increased nearly six fold (from 19 reservoirs covering 0.16% of the study area in 1950 to 329 reservoirs covering 0.95% of the study area in 2010). While agricultural practices were associated with reservoir creation from 1950 to 1970, the highest rates of reservoir construction occurred during subsequent suburban development between 1980 and 1990. Land cover adjacent to individual reservoirs transitioned over time through agricultural abandonment, land reforestation, and conversion to development during suburban expansion. The prolific rate of ongoing small reservoir creation, particularly in newly urbanizing regions and developing counties, necessitates additional attention from watershed managers and continued scientific research into cumulative environmental impacts at the watershed scale.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["54c689cee4b043905e019ad5"],"contacts":[{"name":"Amber R.

Urban sprawl strongly impacts the urban ecosystems it creates and the natural and agro-ecosystems that it displaces and fragments. Here, we project urban sprawl changes for the next 50 years for the fast-growing Southeast U.S. Previous studies have focused on modeling population density, but the urban extent is arguably as important as population density per se in terms of its ecological and conservation impacts. We develop simulations using the SLEUTH urban growth model that complement population-driven models but focus on spatial pattern and extent. To better capture the reach of low-density suburban development, we extend the capabilities of SLEUTH by incorporating street-network information. Our simulations point to a future in which the extent of urbanization in the Southeast is projected to increase by 101% to 192%. Our results highlight areas where ecosystem fragmentation is likely, and serve as a benchmark to explore the challenging tradeoffs between ecosystem health, economic growth and cultural desires.","parentId":"55159243e4b032384278178b","linkParentIds":["4ffae449e4b0c15d5ce9fadf","54c689cee4b043905e019ad5","526ebc6de4b044919baf1393"],"contacts":[{"name":"Adam J.

Modeling System (PRMS) in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin in the southeastern United States","body":"A hydrologic model of the Apalachicola\u2013Chattahoochee\u2013Flint River Basin (ACFB) has been developed as part of a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center effort to provide integrated science that helps resource managers understand the effect of climate change on a range of ecosystem responses. The hydrologic model was developed as part of the Southeast Regional Assessment Project using the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS), a deterministic, distributed-parameter, process-based system that simulates the effects of precipitation, temperature, and land use on basin hydrology.\n\nThe ACFB PRMS model simulates streamflow throughout the approximately 50,700 square-kilometer basin on a daily time step for the period 1950\u201399 using gridded climate forcings of air temperature and precipitation, and parameters derived from spatial data layers of altitude, land cover, soils, surficial geology, depression storage (small water bodies), and data from 56 USGS streamgages. Measured streamflow data from 35 of the 56 USGS streamgages were used to calibrate and evaluate simulated basin streamflow; the remaining gage locations were used for model delineation only. The model matched measured daily streamflow at 31 of the 35 calibration gages with Nash-Sutcliffe Model Efficiency Index (NS) greater than 0.6. Streamflow data for some calibration gages were augmented for regulation and water use effects to represent more natural flow volumes. Time-static parameters describing land cover limited the ability of the simulation to match historical runoff in the more developed subbasins.\n\nOverall, the PRMS simulation of the ACFB provides a good representation of basin hydrology on annual and monthly time steps. Calibration subbasins were analyzed by separating the 35 subbasins into five classes based on physiography, land use, and stream type (tributary or mainstem). The lowest NS values were rarely below 0.6, whereas the median NS for all five classes was within 0.74 to 0.96 for annual mean streamflow, 0.89 to 0.98 for mean monthly streamflow, and 0.82 to 0.98 for monthly mean streamflow. The median bias for all five classes was within \u20134.3 to 0.8 percent for annual mean streamflow, \u20136.3 to 0.5 percent for mean monthly streamflow, and \u20139.3 to 1.3 percent for monthly mean streamflow. The NS results combined with the percent bias results indicated a good to very good streamflow volume simulation for all subbasins.\n\nThis simulation of the ACFB provides a foundation for future modeling and interpretive studies. Streamflow and other components of the hydrologic cycle simulated by PRMS can be used to inform other types of simulations; water-temperature, hydrodynamic, and ecosystem-dynamics simulations are three examples. In addition, possible future hydrologic conditions could be studied using this model in combination with land cover projections and downscaled general circulation model results.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5049fa6be4b02b6b9f7bd914","54c68a19e4b043905e019ae4"],"contacts":[{"name":"Jacob H.

Projections of climate, urbanization, vegetation, and surface-depression storage capacity were used as inputs to the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System to simulate projected impacts on hydrologic response. Surface runoff substantially increased when land cover change was applied. However, once the surface depression storage was added to mitigate the land cover change and increases of surface runoff (due to urbanization), the groundwater flow component then increased. For hydrologic studies that include projections of land cover change (urbanization in particular), any analysis of runoff beyond the change in total runoff should include effects of stormwater management practices as these features affect flow timing and magnitude and may be useful in mitigating land cover change impacts on streamflow. Potential changes in water availability and how biota may respond to changes in flow regime in response to climate and land cover change may prove challenging for managers attempting to balance the needs of future development and the environment. However, these models are still useful for assessing the relative impacts of climate and land cover change and for evaluating tradeoffs when managing to mitigate different stressors.","parentId":"54c68a19e4b043905e019ae4","contacts":[{"name":"Jacob H

the application of the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System in the Upper Flint River Basin, Georgia","body":"This report documents an extension of the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System that accounts for the effect of a large number of water-holding depressions in the land surface on the hydrologic response of a basin. Several techniques for developing the inputs needed by this extension also are presented. These techniques include the delineation of the surface depressions, the generation of volume estimates for the surface depressions, and the derivation of model parameters required to describe these surface depressions. This extension is valuable for applications in basins where surface depressions are too small or numerous to conveniently model as discrete spatial units, but where the aggregated storage capacity of these units is large enough to have a substantial effect on streamflow. In addition, this report documents several new model concepts that were evaluated in conjunction with the depression storage functionality, including: ?hydrologically effective? imperviousness, rates of hydraulic conductivity, and daily streamflow routing. All of these techniques are demonstrated as part of an application in the Upper Flint River Basin, Georgia. Simulated solar radiation, potential evapotranspiration, and water balances match observations well, with small errors for the first two simulated data in June and August because of differences in temperatures from the calibration and evaluation periods for those months. Daily runoff simulations show increasing accuracy with streamflow and a good fit overall. Including surface depression storage in the model has the effect of decreasing daily streamflow for all but the lowest flow values. The report discusses the choices and resultant effects involved in delineating and parameterizing these features. The remaining enhancements to the model and its application provide a more realistic description of basin geography and hydrology that serve to constrain the calibration process to more physically realistic parameter values.","parentId":"504216bae4b04b508bfd3385","linkParentIds":["5049fa6be4b02b6b9f7bd914","51644459e4b0b7010f82021f","54c68a19e4b043905e019ae4"],"contacts":[{"name":"Viger, Roland

A more cost-effective alternative could be the use of dynamic occupancy models to predict how species are likely to respond to changes in flow. To appraise the efficacy of this approach, we evaluated relative support for hypothesized effects of seasonal streamflow components, stream channel characteristics, and fish species traits on local extinction, colonization, and recruitment (meta-demographic rates) of stream fishes. We used 4 years of seasonal fish collection data from 23 streams to fit multistate, multiseason occupancy models for 42 fish species in the lower Flint River Basin, Georgia. Modelling results suggested that meta-demographic rates were influenced by streamflows, particularly short-term (10-day) flows. Flow effects on meta-demographic rates also varied with stream size, channel morphology, and fish species traits. Small-bodied species with generalized life-history characteristics were more resilient to flow variability than large-bodied species with specialized life-history characteristics. Using this approach, we simplified the modelling framework, thereby facilitating the development of dynamic, spatially explicit evaluations of the ecological consequences of water resource development activities over broad geographic areas.

We present a framework and methods for integrating hydrology, geographic context and metapopulation processes to simulate effects of changes in streamflow on fish occupancy dynamics across a landscape of interconnected stream segments. We illustrate this approach using a 482 km2&nbsp;catchment in the southeastern US supporting 50 or more stream fish species. A spatially distributed, deterministic and physically based hydrologic model is used to simulate daily streamflow for sub-basins composing the catchment. We use geographic data to characterize stream segments with respect to channel size, confinement, position and connectedness within the stream network. Simulated streamflow dynamics are then applied to model fish metapopulation dynamics in stream segments, using hypothesized effects of streamflow magnitude and variability on population processes, conditioned by channel characteristics. The resulting time series simulate spatially explicit, annual changes in species occurrences or assemblage metrics (e.g. species richness) across the catchment as outcomes of management scenarios. Sensitivity analyses using alternative, plausible links between streamflow components and metapopulation processes, or allowing for alternative modes of fish dispersal, demonstrate large effects of ecological uncertainty on model outcomes and highlight needed research and monitoring. Nonetheless, with uncertainties explicitly acknowledged, dynamic, landscape-scale simulations may prove useful for quantitatively comparing river management alternatives with respect to species conservation.

It is generally accepted that not all mussels or species are collected during surveys, and incomplete detection of individuals and species can bias data and can affect inferences. However, considerably less attention has been given to the potential effects of species misidentification. To evaluate the prevalence of and potential reasons for species misidentification, we conducted a laboratory-based identification exercise and quantified the relationships between mussel species characteristics, observer experience, and misidentification rate. We estimated that misidentification was fairly common, with rates averaging 27% across all species and ranging from 0 to 56%, and was related to mussel shell characteristics and observer experience. Most notably, species with shell texturing were 6.09\u00d7 less likely than smooth-shelled species to be misidentified. Misidentification rates declined with observer experience, but for many species the risk of misidentification averaged &gt;10% even for observers with moderate levels of experience (5\u20136&nbsp;y). In addition, misidentification rates among observers showed substantial variability after controlling for experience. Our results suggest that species misidentification may be common in field surveys of freshwater mussels and could potentially bias estimates of population status and trends. Misidentification rates possibly could be reduced through use of regional workshops, testing and certification programs, and the availability of archived specimens and tissue samples in museum collections.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["54c68ce0e4b043905e019b10"],"contacts":[{"name":"Colin P.

The U.S. Geological Survey and the Department of the Interior\u2019s National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center established the Southeast Regional Assessment Project (SERAP) which used downscaled general circulation models to develop landscape-scale assessments of climate change and subsequent effects on land cover, ecosystems, and priority species in the southeastern United States. The SERAP aquatic and hydrologic dynamics modeling efforts involve multiscale watershed hydrology, stream-temperature, and fish-occupancy models, which all are based on the same stream network. Models were developed for the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin and subbasins in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, and for the Upper Roanoke River Basin in Virginia.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>The stream network was used as the spatial scheme through which information was shared across the various models within SERAP. Because these models operate at different scales, coordinated pair versions of the network were delineated, characterized, and parameterized for coarse- and fine-scale hydrologic and biologic modeling.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>The stream network used for the SERAP aquatic models was extracted from a 30-meter (m) scale digital elevation model (DEM) using standard topographic analysis of flow accumulation. At the finer scale, reaches were delineated to represent lengths of stream channel with fairly homogenous physical characteristics (mean reach length = 350 m). Every reach in the network is designated with geomorphic attributes including upstream drainage basin area, channel gradient, channel width, valley width, Strahler and Shreve stream order, stream power, and measures of stream confinement. The reach network was aggregated from tributary junction to tributary junction to define segments for the benefit of hydrological, soil erosion, and coarser ecological modeling. Reach attributes are summarized for each segment. In six subbasins segments are assigned additional attributes about barriers (usually impoundments) to fish migration and stream isolation. Segments in the six sub-basins are also attributed with percent urban area for the watershed upstream from the stream segment for each decade from 2010\u20132100 from models of urban growth.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>On a broader scale, for application in a coarse-scale species-response model, the stream-network information is aggregated and summarized by 256 drainage subbasins (Hydrologic Response Units) used for watershed hydrologic and stream-temperature models. A model of soil erodibility based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation also was developed at this scale to parameterize a model to evaluate stream condition.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>The reach-scale network was classified using multivariate clustering based on modeled channel width, valley width, and mean reach gradient as variables. The resulting classification consists of a 6-cluster and a 12-cluster classification for every reach in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Basin. We present an example of the utility of the classification that was tested using the occurrence of two species of darters and two species of minnows in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin, the blackbanded darter and Halloween darter, and the bluestripe shiner and blacktail shiner.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["54c68ce0e4b043905e019b10"],"contacts":[{"name":"Caroline M.

dependent on urban sprawl as it is on human-caused climatic warming. Urban sprawl strongly impacts the urban ecosystems it creates and the natural and agro-ecosystems that it displaces and fragments. Here, we project urban sprawl changes for the next 50 years for the fast-growing Southeast U.S. Previous studies have focused on modeling population density, but the urban extent is arguably as important as population density per se in terms of its ecological and conservation impacts. We develop simulations using the SLEUTH urban growth model that complement population-driven models but focus on spatial pattern and extent. To better capture the reach of low-density suburban development, we extend the capabilities of SLEUTH by incorporating street-network information. Our simulations point to a future in which the extent of urbanization in the Southeast is projected to increase by 101% to 192%. Our results highlight areas where ecosystem fragmentation is likely, and serve as a benchmark to explore the challenging tradeoffs between ecosystem health, economic growth and cultural desires.","parentId":"55159243e4b032384278178b","linkParentIds":["4ffae449e4b0c15d5ce9fadf","54c689cee4b043905e019ad5","526ebc6de4b044919baf1393"],"contacts":[{"name":"Adam J.

Unfortunately, climate change may be putting the species at further risk. Sea-level rise, increased storm frequency, and changes in temperature and humidity could reduce the suitability of habitat used by loggerheads and other endangered sea turtles for nesting and feeding.<br> &nbsp;<br> This project assessed the vulnerability of key sea turtle nesting beaches to climate change in the Southeast. Researchers examined previous records of sea turtle nesting locations in the Southeast to identify the characteristics of these beaches, then predicted the future suitability of these beaches for nesting based on projected climate change. Beaches on both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are expected to be very susceptible to change associated with sea-level rise, making it imperitive that we understand how these changes will affect the suitability of nesting sites.<br> &nbsp;<br> The results of this work can be used to directly inform federal recovery efforts for the loggerhead sea turtle. Identifying locations where beach habitat will no longer be suitable for nesting will help managers determine what action needs to be taken to protect loggerheads, such as moving nests out of highly vulnerable areas. Further, some of the nesting beaches used by loggerheads are also used by other endangered sea turtles, such as the Kemp\u2019s ridley, green, and leatherback sea turtles. Therefore, this project represents a vulnerability assessment of coastal nesting habitat for multiple species of national conservation concern.<br> &nbsp;<\/p> \n<\/div>","purpose":"Sea-level rise, increased storm frequency, and altered temperature and humidity associated with climate change may reduce the suitability of nesting and foraging habitats used by federally threatened and endangered species, such as the loggerhead sea turtle. The goal of this project was to produce a vulnerability assessment of coastal habitats representing important nesting grounds for loggerhead and other endangered sea turtles (e.g. Kemp\u2019s ridleys, green turtles, and leatherbacks). This project built upon work already being done to develop vulnerability maps under a number of current and future climate scenarios. These maps will provide management guidance and will serve to identify knowledge and data gaps as primary sources of uncertainty.

can be determined using satellite telemetry. Because of a lack of information on MPA use by marine turtles in the Gulf of Mexico, we used satellite transmitters in 2010 and 2011 to track movements of 11 adult female breeding green turtles (\n<em>Chelonia mydas<\/em>) tagged in Dry Tortugas National Park (DRTO), in the Gulf of Mexico, south Florida, USA. Throughout the study period, turtles emerged every 9\u201318&nbsp;days to nest. During the intervals between nesting episodes (i.e., inter-nesting periods), the turtles consistently used a common core-area within the DRTO boundary, determined using individual 50% kernel-density estimates (KDEs). We mapped the area in DRTO where individual turtle 50% KDEs overlapped using the USGS Along-Track Reef-Imaging System, and determined the diversity and distribution of various benthic-cover types within the mapped area. We also tracked turtles post-nesting as they transited to foraging sites 5\u2013282&nbsp;km away from tagging beaches; these sites were located both within DRTO and in the surrounding area of the Florida Keys and Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS), a regional MPA. Year-round residency of 9 out of 11 individuals (82%) both within DRTO and in the FKNMS represents novel non-migratory behavior, which offers an opportunity for conservation of this imperiled species at both local and regional scales. These data comprise the first satellite-tracking results on adult nesting green turtles at this remote study site. Additional tracking could reveal whether the distinct inter-nesting and foraging sites delineated here will be repeatedly used in the future by these and other breeding green turtles.","parentId":"5049f419e4b02b6b9f7bd8e2","contacts":[{"name":"Kristen M Hart","oldPartyId":4290,"type":"Author","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"kristen_hart@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Kristen","middleName":"M","lastName":"Hart","cellPhone":"9546500336","organization":{"displayText":"Southeast Ecological Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9544754125","streetAddress":{"zip":"33314-7799","country":"US","city":"Davie","state":"FL","line1":"3205 College Ave."},"buildingCode":"AAF","name":"Kristen M Hart\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

Because of a lack of information on habitat-use by marine turtles in the northern Gulf of Mexico, we used satellite transmitters in 2010 through 2012 to track movements of 39 adult female breeding loggerhead turtles (\n<em>Caretta caretta<\/em>) tagged on nesting beaches at three sites in Florida and Alabama. During the nesting season, recaptured turtles emerged to nest 1 to 5 times, with mean distance between emergences of 27.5 km; however, several turtles nested on beaches separated by ~250 km within a single season. Mean total distances traveled throughout inter-nesting periods for all turtles was 1422.0&plusmn;930.8 km. In-water inter-nesting sites, delineated using 50% kernel density estimation (KDE), were located a mean distance of 33.0 km from land, in water with mean depth of \u221231.6 m; other in-water inter-nesting sites, delineated using minimum convex polygon (MCP) approach, were located a mean 13.8 km from land and in water with a mean depth of \u221215.8 m. Mean size of in-water inter-nesting habitats were 61.9 km2&nbsp;(50% KDEs, n = 10) and 741.4 km2&nbsp;(MCPs, n = 30); these areas overlapped significantly with trawling and oil and gas extraction activities. Abundance estimates for this nesting subpopulation may be inaccurate in light of how much spread there is between nests of the same individual. Further, our results also have consequences for critical habitat designations for northern Gulf loggerheads, as protection of one nesting beach would not encompass the entire range used by turtles during breeding seasons.","parentId":"5049f419e4b02b6b9f7bd8e2","contacts":[{"name":"Public Library of Science","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Kristen M.

technical input to the 2013 National Climate Assessment","body":"<p>The coast has long provided communities with a multitude of benefits including an \nabundance of natural resources that sustain economies, societies, and ecosystems. \nCoasts provide natural harbors for commerce, trade, and transportation; beaches and \nshorelines that attract residents and tourists; and wetlands and estuaries that are critical for fisheries and water resources. Coastal ecosystems provide critical functions to \ncycle and move nutrients, store carbon, detoxify wastes, and purify air and water. These \nareas also mitigate floods and buffer against coastal storms that bring high winds and \nsalt water inland and erode the shore. Coastal regions are critical in the development, \ntransportation, and processing of oil and natural gas resources and, more recently, are \nbeing explored as a source of energy captured from wind and waves. The many benefits \nand opportunities provided in coastal areas have strengthened our economic reliance on \ncoastal resources. Consequently, the high demands placed on the coastal environment \nwill increase commensurately with human activity. Because 35 U.S. states, commonwealths, and territories have coastlines that border the oceans or Great Lakes, impacts to \ncoastline systems will reverberate through social, economic, and natural systems across \nthe U.S.<\/p> \n<br>\n<p>Impacts on coastal systems are among the most costly and most certain consequences \nof a warming climate (Nicholls et al., 2007). The warming atmosphere is expected to \naccelerate sea-level rise as a result of the decline of glaciers and ice sheets and the thermal expansion of sea water. As mean sea level rises, coastal shorelines will retreat and \nlow-lying areas will tend to be inundated more frequently, if not permanently, by the \nadvancing sea. As atmospheric temperature increases and rainfall patterns change, soil \nmoisture and runoff to the coast are likely to be altered. An increase in the intensity of \nclimatic extremes such as storms and heat spells, coupled with other impacts of climate \nchange and the effects of human development, could affect the sustainability of many \nexisting coastal communities and natural resources.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>This report, one of a series of technical inputs for the third NCA conducted under the \nauspices of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, examines the known effects and \nrelationships of climate change variables on the coasts of the U.S. It describes the impacts \non natural and human systems, including several major sectors of the U.S. economy, and \nthe progress and challenges to planning and implementing adaptation options.

The focus of this guide was to categorize and describe the suite of data,&nbsp;methods, and models, their design, structure, and application, for hindcasting and&nbsp;forecasting the potential impacts of sea-level rise in coastal environments. Basic&nbsp;illustrations of the components of the Earth\u2019s hydrosphere and effects of plate tectonics,&nbsp;planetary orbits, and glaciation are explained to understand the long-term cycles of&nbsp;historical sea-level rise and fall. Discussion of proper interpretation of contemporary sea level&nbsp;rates and trends from tide gauge stations and satellite altimetry missions are&nbsp;presented to show their complementary aspects and value for understanding variability in&nbsp;sea-level rise and land motion for different coastal reaches of the U.S. Examples of the&nbsp;different types and classes of hydrology and ecosystem models used to predict potential&nbsp;effects of future sea-level rise at local and regional scale applications are presented.&nbsp;Coastal land managers, engineers, and scientists will benefit from this synthesis of tools&nbsp;and models that have been developed for projecting causes and consequences of sea-level&nbsp;change on the landscape and seascape.&nbsp;","purpose":"Coastal wetlands of the Southeastern United States are undergoing retreat and migration\nfrom increasing tidal inundation and saltwater intrusion attributed to climate variability\nand sea-level rise. Much of the literature describing potential sea-level rise projections\nand modeling predictions are found in peer-reviewed academic journals or government\ntechnical reports largely suited to reading by other Ph.D. scientists who are more familiar\nor engaged in the climate change debate. Various sea-level rise and coastal wetland\nmodels have been developed and applied of different designs and scales of spatial and\ntemporal complexity for predicting habitat and environmental change that have not\nheretofore been synthesized to aid natural resource managers of their utility and\nlimitations. Training sessions were conducted with Federal land managers with U.S. Fish\nand Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and NOAA National Estuarine Research\nReserves as well as state partners and nongovernmental organizations across the northern\nGulf Coast from Florida to Texas to educate and to evaluate user needs and\nunderstanding of concepts, data, and modeling tools for projecting sea-level rise and its\nimpact on coastal habitats and wildlife. As a result, this handbook was constructed from\nthese training and feedback sessions with coastal managers and biologists of published\ndecision-support tools and simulation models for sea-level rise and climate change\nassessments. A simplified tabular context was developed listing the various kinds of\ndecision-support tools and ecological models along with criteria to distinguish the source,\nscale, and quality of information input and geographic data sets, physical and biological\nconstraints and relationships, datum characteristics of water and land elevation\ncomponents, utility options for setting sea-level rise and climate change scenarios, and\nease or difficulty of storing, displaying, or interpreting model output. The handbook is\ndesigned to be a primer to understanding sea-level rise and a practical synthesis of the\ncurrent state of knowledge and modeling tools as a resource guide for DOl land\nmanagement needs and facilitating Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) research\nand conservation initiatives.","parentId":"505b5fe8e4b08c986b30c27f","contacts":[{"name":"Thomas W Doyle","oldPartyId":2671,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"doylet@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"ECOLOGIST (RESEARCH)","firstName":"Thomas","middleName":"W","lastName":"Doyle","cellPhone":"3379621884","organization":{"displayText":"National Wetlands Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"3372668592","officePhone":"3372668647","streetAddress":{"zip":"70506","city":"Lafayette","state":"LA","line1":"700 Cajundome Blvd"},"buildingCode":"KFA","name":"Thomas W Doyle\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"70506","country":"USA","city":"Lafayette","state":"LA","line1":"700 Cajundome Blvd."},"building":"NWRC - Office\/LAb Building"}},{"name":"Southeast Climate Science Center","oldPartyId":59608,"type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","active":true,"aliases":["Southeast CSC","SECSC","NCCWSC SE (CSC)"],"fbmsCodes":["GGHCEN0502","GGHCGR0502"],"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"Southeast Climate Science Center - Location","mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Acquisition","dateString":"2015-09-29","label":"Acquisition"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-09-30T12:28:18.134-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-21T09:11:19.379-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"other":[{"type":"Acquisition","dateString":"2015-09-29","label":"Acquisition"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-09-30T12:28:18.134-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-21T09:11:19.379-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Final Memo","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":123503,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-10-02T14:48:35.000Z","name":"Final_Memorandum_SLR_Modeling_Handbook.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__f0\/70\/1d\/f0701d30740d7b966c4ac5568a788e1366825272","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/560c29c2e4b058f706e540f9?f=__disk__f0%2F70%2F1d%2Ff0701d30740d7b966c4ac5568a788e1366825272"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/560c29c2e4b058f706e540f9","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalMemoforAHa.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["Thomas W Doyle"],"orgs":["Southeast Climate Science Center"],"children":[]},"56f036e4e4b0f59b85dd1275":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5016cd90e4b06fb5ce8b7376","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Keeping Pace: A short guide to navigating sea-level rise models","relatedTitle":"A Handbook for Resource Managers to Understand and Utilize Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Wetland Models for Ecosystem Management under Future Conditions","id":"56f036e4e4b0f59b85dd1275","relatedId":"5016cd90e4b06fb5ce8b7376","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/56f036e4e4b0f59b85dd1275","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"A Handbook for Resource Managers to Understand and Utilize Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Wetland Models for Ecosystem Management under Future Conditions","relatedTitle":"Keeping Pace: A short guide to navigating sea-level rise models","id":"5016cd90e4b06fb5ce8b7376","relatedId":"56f036e4e4b0f59b85dd1275","annotation":null}]},"id":"56f036e4e4b0f59b85dd1275","title":"Keeping Pace: A short guide to navigating sea-level rise models","body":"The Northern Gulf of Mexico Sentinel Site Cooperative and the Southeast Climate Science Center developed a new resource -&nbsp; \n<em>Keeping Pace: A short guide to navigating sea-level rise models<\/em>!

In 2012, the U.S. Geological Survey conducted more than 30 training and feedback sessions with Federal, State, and nongovernmental organization (NGO) coastal managers and planners across the northern Gulf of Mexico coast to evaluate user needs, potential benefits, current scientific understanding, and utilization of resource aids and modeling tools focused on sea-level rise. In response to the findings from the sessions, this sea-level rise modeling handbook has been designed as a guide to the science and simulation models for understanding the dynamics and impacts of sea-level rise on coastal ecosystems. The review herein of decision-support tools and predictive models was compiled from the training sessions, from online research, and from publications. The purpose of this guide is to describe and categorize the suite of data, methods, and models and their design, structure, and application for hindcasting and forecasting the potential impacts of sea-level rise in coastal ecosystems. The data and models cover a broad spectrum of disciplines involving different designs and scales of spatial and temporal complexity for predicting environmental change and ecosystem response. These data and models have not heretofore been synthesized, nor have appraisals been made of their utility or limitations. Some models are demonstration tools for non-experts, whereas others require more expert capacity to apply for any given park, refuge, or regional application. A simplified tabular context has been developed to list and contrast a host of decision-support tools and models from the ecological, geological, and hydrological perspectives. Criteria were established to distinguish the source, scale, and quality of information input and geographic datasets; physical and biological constraints and relations; datum characteristics of water and land components; utility options for setting sea-level rise and climate change scenarios; and ease or difficulty of storing, displaying, or interpreting model output.

Ecosystems in the Southeastern U.S.","body":"<p>The southeastern U.S. contains a unique diversity of ecosystems that provide important benefits, including habitat for wildlife and plants, water quality, and recreation opportunities. As climate changes, a better understanding of how our ecosystems will be affected is vital for identifying strategies to protect these ecosystems. We assessed climate change vulnerability for twelve ecosystems in the southeastern U.S. and Caribbean. We synthesized data and literature related to three components of vulnerability: climate sensitivity, climate change exposure, and adaptive capacity. We also summarized all information into a qualitative vulnerability rating for each ecosystem. Based on the available information, we identified critical management actions for reducing the vulnerability of each ecosystem. Next, for two of the twelve ecosystems, we used NatureServe\u2019s Habitat Climate Change Vulnerability Index (HCCVI) framework as an alternative approach for assessing vulnerability. Using the HCCVI, we developed a numeric vulnerability rating for the two ecosystems. Of the twelve ecosystems we assessed in the first approach, five were rated as having high vulnerability, six had moderate vulnerability,&nbsp;and one had low vulnerability.&nbsp;For the two ecosystems we assessed with both approaches, vulnerability ratings generally agreed. Important conservation strategies we identified to reduce vulnerability and improve adaptive capacity for the ecosystems included maintaining connectivity, restoring or maintaining disturbance processes, and minimizing the effects of urbanization. This synthesis of this information for key ecosystems across the entire Southeast and Caribbean will enable regional decision-makers to prioritize current efforts and plan future research and monitoring for conservation of these important ecosystems.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"5006f8dee4b0abf7ce733fc5","contacts":[{"name":"Jaime A Collazo","oldPartyId":1970,"type":"Principal

United States","body":"<p>Climate change impacts ecosystems in many ways, from effects on species to phenology to wildfire dynamics. Assessing the potential vulnerability of ecosystems to future changes in climate is an important first step in prioritizing and planning for conservation. Although assessments of climate change vulnerability commonly are done for species, fewer have been done for ecosystems. To aid regional conservation planning efforts, we assessed climate change vulnerability for ecosystems in the Southeastern United States and Caribbean.<\/p><p>First, we solicited input from experts to create a list of candidate ecosystems for assessment. From that list, 12 ecosystems were selected for a vulnerability assessment that was based on a synthesis of available geographic information system (GIS) data and literature related to 3 components of vulnerability\u2014sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity. This literature and data synthesis comprised \u201cPhase I\u201d of the assessment. Sensitivity is the degree to which the species or processes in the ecosystem are affected by climate. Exposure is the likely future change in important climate and sea level variables. Adaptive capacity is the degree to which ecosystems can adjust to changing conditions. Where available, GIS data relevant to each of these components were used. For example, we summarized observed and projected climate, protected areas existing in 2011, projected sea-level rise, and projected urbanization across each ecosystem\u2019s distribution. These summaries were supplemented with information in the literature, and a short narrative assessment was compiled for each ecosystem. We also summarized all information into a qualitative vulnerability rating for each ecosystem.<\/p><p>Next, for 2 of the 12 ecosystems (East Gulf Coastal Plain Near-Coast Pine Flatwoods and Nashville Basin Limestone Glade and Woodland), the NatureServe Habitat Climate Change Vulnerability Index (HCCVI) framework was used as an alternative approach for assessing vulnerability. Use of the HCCVI approach comprised \u201cPhase II\u201d of the assessment. This approach uses summaries of GIS data and models to develop a series of numeric indices for components of vulnerability. We incorporated many of the data sources used in Phase I, but added the results of several other data sources, including climate envelope modeling and vegetation dynamics modeling. The results of Phase II were high and low numeric vulnerability ratings for mid-century and the end of century for each ecosystem. The high and low ratings represented the potential range of vulnerability scores owing to uncertainties in future climate conditions and ecosystem effects.<\/p><p>Of the 12 ecosystems assessed in the first approach, five were rated as having high vulnerability (Caribbean Coastal Mangrove, Caribbean Montane Wet Elfin Forest, East Gulf Coastal Plain Southern Loess Bluff Forest, Edwards Plateau Limestone Shrubland, and Nashville Basin Limestone Glade and Woodland). Six ecosystems had medium vulnerability, and one ecosystem had low vulnerability. For the two ecosystems assessed with both approaches, vulnerability ratings generally agreed. The assessment concluded by comparing the two approaches, identifying critical research needs, and making suggestions for future ecosystem vulnerability assessments in the Southeast and beyond. Research needs include reducing uncertainty in the degree of climate exposure likely in the future, as well as acquiring more information on how climate might affect biotic interactions and hydrologic processes. Ideally, a comprehensive vulnerability assessment would include both the narrative summaries that resulted from the synthesis in Phase I, as well as a numeric index that incorporates uncertainty as in Phase II.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["4f4e4ddfe4b07f02db6b58d0","505b5a8ce4b08c986b30c24b"],"contacts":[{"name":"Jennifer Costanza","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Scott Beck","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Milo Pyne","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Adam Terando","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"aterando@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Matthew J.

These insular ecosystems share a few key biogeographic characteristics: (1) occurrences that are spatially discrete, (2) relatively small geographic footprints, and (3) with steep ecological and environmental gradients at their boundaries. Examples include rock outcrop ecosystems (e.g. Piedmont granite outcrops, Appalachian high-elevation outcrops), grasslands (high-elevation balds, xeric limestone prairies), isolated wetlands (Carolina bays, karst depression wetlands) and riparian riverscour systems. Such insular ecosystems tend to support concentrations of endemic and disjunct species; thus their contributions to regional biodiversity are often disproportionate to their small geographic sizes.<\/p> \n<p>For this project, researchers conducted a systematic literature review to document the biodiversity of selected insular ecosystems and to evaluate their potential vulnerability to climate change. They&nbsp;developed a conceptual model for ecosystem integrity based on abiotic stress regimes which fluctuate within certain upper and lower bounds and applied this model to generate hypotheses for ecological alteration based on changes in temperature or precipitation. They&nbsp;also conducted a 2-year field investigation in Limestone Cedar Glades\u2014a threatened, insular ecosystem of the Interior Low Plateau\u2014to explore links between hydrology, soil physical and chemical properties, and ecological outcomes such as soil microbial community structure. This case study serves as an example of the type of empirical research that researchers&nbsp;argue is necessary to better evaluate the climate-change vulnerability of this class of ecosystems.<\/p>","parentId":"505b5a8ce4b08c986b30c24b","contacts":[{"name":"Jennifer Cartwright","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/webinar\/304","title":"Climate-sensitive, Insular Ecosystems of the Southeastern U.S.: The State of the Science and a Case Study of Limestone Cedar Glades in the Central Basin of Tennessee","hidden":false}],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"tags":[{"name":"insular ecosystem"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-02-19","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-09-26T12:24:55.297-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-11-09T15:03:08.547-07:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2014","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-09-26T12:24:55.297-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-11-09T15:03:08.547-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/5425af77e4b0e641df8c618a?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/5425af77e4b0e641df8c618a?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5425af77e4b0e641df8c618a","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"Climate_sensiti.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["Jennifer Cartwright"],"orgs":["Southeast CSC"],"children":[]},"57ad93a0e4b0d183567650f5":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5016c962e4b06fb5ce8b736d","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Ecosystem vulnerability to climate change in the southeastern United States","relatedTitle":"Assessing Climate-Sensitive Ecosystems in the Southeastern U.S.","id":"57ad93a0e4b0d183567650f5","relatedId":"5016c962e4b06fb5ce8b736d","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/57ad93a0e4b0d183567650f5","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Assessing Climate-Sensitive Ecosystems in the Southeastern U.S.","relatedTitle":"Ecosystem vulnerability to climate change in the southeastern United States","id":"5016c962e4b06fb5ce8b736d","relatedId":"57ad93a0e4b0d183567650f5","annotation":null}]},"id":"57ad93a0e4b0d183567650f5","title":"Ecosystem vulnerability to climate change in the southeastern United States","body":"<p>Two recent investigations of climate-change vulnerability for 19 terrestrial, aquatic, riparian, and coastal ecosystems of the southeastern United States have identified a number of important considerations, including potential for changes in hydrology, disturbance regimes, and interspecies interactions.

As climate changes, a better understanding of how our ecosystems will be affected is vital for identifying strategies to protect these ecosystems. We assessed climate change vulnerability for twelve ecosystems in the southeastern U.S. and Caribbean. We synthesized data and literature related to three components of vulnerability: climate sensitivity, climate change exposure, and adaptive capacity. We also summarized all information into a qualitative vulnerability rating for each ecosystem. Based on the available information, we identified critical management actions for reducing the vulnerability of each ecosystem. Next, for two of the twelve ecosystems, we used NatureServe\u2019s Habitat Climate Change Vulnerability Index (HCCVI) framework as an alternative approach for assessing vulnerability. Using the HCCVI, we developed a numeric vulnerability rating for the two ecosystems. Of the twelve ecosystems we assessed in the first approach, five were rated as having high vulnerability, six had moderate vulnerability,&nbsp;and one had low vulnerability.&nbsp;For the two ecosystems we assessed with both approaches, vulnerability ratings generally agreed. Important conservation strategies we identified to reduce vulnerability and improve adaptive capacity for the ecosystems included maintaining connectivity, restoring or maintaining disturbance processes, and minimizing the effects of urbanization. This synthesis of this information for key ecosystems across the entire Southeast and Caribbean will enable regional decision-makers to prioritize current efforts and plan future research and monitoring for conservation of these important ecosystems. &nbsp;","parentId":"505b5a8ce4b08c986b30c24b","contacts":[{"name":"Jaime A Collazo","oldPartyId":1970,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"jaime_collazo@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Assistant Unit Leader Research Wildlife Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Jaime","middleName":"A","lastName":"Collazo","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9195154454","officePhone":"9195158837","streetAddress":{"zip":"27695-7617","city":"Raleigh","state":"NC","line1":"David Clark Labs, NC State Univ"},"buildingCode":"AVD","name":"Jaime A Collazo\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"27695-7617","country":"USA","city":"Raleigh","state":"NC","line1":"NC Coop F&W Res Unit, NC St Univ, Dept of Zoology, Campus Box 7617"},"building":"Bldg Record"}}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2014-07-24","label":"Date Reported"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-04-08T13:25:00.161-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-21T09:18:57.602-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"other":[{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2014-07-24","label":"Date Reported"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-04-08T13:25:00.161-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-21T09:18:57.602-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":508156,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-04-08T19:24:55.000Z","name":"006 Final Memo Collazo_&_Costanza.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__09\/4c\/da\/094cda85bdca6cfb04bd1d8fc409d3bcae8c8759","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5525808ce4b027f0aee3d5ea?f=__disk__09%2F4c%2Fda%2F094cda85bdca6cfb04bd1d8fc409d3bcae8c8759"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5525808ce4b027f0aee3d5ea","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalProjectMem.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["Jaime A Collazo"],"children":[]},"57ad93a1e4b0d183567650f9":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5016c962e4b06fb5ce8b736d","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Insular ecosystems of the southeastern United States\u2014A regional synthesis to support biodiversity conservation in a changing climate","relatedTitle":"Assessing Climate-Sensitive Ecosystems in the Southeastern U.S.","id":"57ad93a1e4b0d183567650f9","relatedId":"5016c962e4b06fb5ce8b736d","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/57ad93a1e4b0d183567650f9","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Assessing Climate-Sensitive Ecosystems in the Southeastern U.S.","relatedTitle":"Insular ecosystems of the southeastern United States\u2014A regional synthesis to support biodiversity conservation in a changing climate","id":"5016c962e4b06fb5ce8b736d","relatedId":"57ad93a1e4b0d183567650f9","annotation":null}]},"id":"57ad93a1e4b0d183567650f9","title":"Insular ecosystems of the southeastern United States\u2014A regional synthesis to support biodiversity conservation in a changing climate","body":"<p>In the southeastern United States, insular ecosystems\u2014such as rock outcrops, depression wetlands, high-elevation balds, flood-scoured riparian corridors, and insular prairies and barrens\u2014occupy a small fraction of land area but constitute an important source of regional and global biodiversity, including concentrations of rare and endemic plant taxa. Maintenance of this biodiversity depends upon regimes of abiotic stress and disturbance, incorporating factors such as soil surface temperature, widely fluctuating hydrologic conditions, fires, flood scouring, and episodic droughts that may be subject to alteration by climate change. Over several decades, numerous localized, site-level investigations have yielded important information about the floristics, physical environments, and ecological dynamics of these insular ecosystems; however, the literature from these investigations has generally remained fragmented. This report consists of literature syntheses for eight categories of insular ecosystems of the southeastern United States, concerning (1) physical geography, (2) ecological determinants of community structures including vegetation dynamics and regimes of abiotic stress and disturbance, (3) contributions to regional and global biodiversity, (4) historical and current anthropogenic threats and conservation approaches, and (5) key knowledge gaps relevant to conservation, particularly in terms of climate-change effects on biodiversity. This regional synthesis was undertaken to discern patterns across ecosystems, identify knowledge gaps, and lay the groundwork for future analyses of climate-change vulnerability. Findings from this synthesis indicate that, despite their importance to regional and global biodiversity, insular ecosystems of the southeastern United States have been subjected to a variety of direct and indirect human alterations. In many cases, important questions remain concerning key determinants of ecosystem function. In particular, few empirical investigations in these ecosystems have focused on possible climate-change effects, despite the well-documented ecological effects of climate change at a global level. Long-term management of these ecosystems could benefit from increased scientific effort to characterize and quantify the linkages between changing environmental conditions and the ecological processes that sustain biodiversity.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["505b5a8ce4b08c986b30c24b"],"contacts":[{"name":"Jennifer M.

Annual censuses of 162-193 seedling plots from 1997 through 2001 demonstrate that the critical stage for tree survival is the transition from seedling to sapling and that this transition is limited to shallow (less than 0.5 meters) ponding depths. Recruitment of saplings to the small adult class also was restricted to shallow areas. Analysis of the spatial and elevation distribution of tree-size classes in a representative 2.3-hectare area of Sinking Pond showed a general absence of overcup oak saplings and young adults in deep (ponding depth greater than 1 meter) and intermediate (ponding depth 0.5-1 meter) areas, even though overcup oak seedlings and mature trees are concentrated in these areas. \r\n\r\nAnalysis of tree rings from 45 trees sampled in a 2.3-hectare spatial-analysis plot showed an even distribution of tree ages across ponding-depth classes from the 1800s through 1970, followed by complete suppression of recruitment in deep and intermediate areas after 1970. Trees younger than 30 years were spatially and vertically concentrated in a small area with shallow ponding depth, about 0.5 meter below the spillway elevation. Results of hydrologic modeling, based on rainfall and temperature records covering the period January 1854 through September 2002, show ponding durations after 1970 considerably longer than historical norms, across ponding-depth classes. This increase in ponding duration corresponds closely with similar increases documented in published analyses of streamflow and precipitation in the eastern United States and with the suppression of tree regeneration at ponding depths greater than 0.5 meter indicated by tree-ring analysis. Comparison of the simulated stage record for Sinking Pond with the ages and elevations of sampled trees shows that prolonged (200 days or more per year) inundation in more than 2 of the first 5 years after germination is inversely related to successful tree recruitment and that such inundation was rare before 1970 and common afterwards.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["505b5a8ce4b08c986b30c24b"],"contacts":[{"name":"William J.

Portal: Pilot Project for the Southeastern U.S.","body":"<p>A significant challenge faced by climate scientists and land managers in the public and private sectors is the need for reliable and complete information about the status of ecosystem components (e.g. air, land, water, plants, animals) that may be influenced by climate change. While many organizations monitor one or more aspect of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, these monitoring programs are seldom coordinated and the associated data are not readily discoverable. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/my.usgs.gov\/gcmp\/\">Global Change Monitoring Portal (GCMP)<\/a>&nbsp;is a recently released tool of the DOI Southeast Climate Science Center designed to support the efforts of multiple federal, state, and other organizations by connecting them to these data resources. The GCMP will provide a centralized, comprehensive catalog of information about monitoring networks associated with aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems that can be used to assess the potential effects of climate change in the southeastern United States. Monitoring programs are classified according to the types of observations made, such as media and parameter category, and monitoring sites are mapped into geographic categories such as Ecoregion and Landscape Conservation Cooperative, so that the database can be searched and displayed by measurement and\/or geographic criteria. This webinar introduces some of the features of the Global Change Monitoring Portal, currently in the first phase of development.&nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"505b62cde4b08c986b30ce61","contacts":[{"name":"Cari Furiness","oldPartyId":62686,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"cari_furiness@ncsu.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Cari","lastName":"Furiness","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/webinar\/359","title":"Webinar Recording","hidden":false}],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"tags":[{"name":"climate change"},{"name":"terrestrial ecosystem"},{"name":"aquatic ecosystems"},{"name":"aquatic ecosystem"},{"name":"terrestrial ecosystem"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-08-26","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-10-01T10:23:08.693-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-23T10:41:32.850-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2014","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-10-01T10:23:08.693-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-23T10:41:32.850-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/542c2a6ce4b0abfb4c8099a8?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/542c2a6ce4b0abfb4c8099a8?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/542c2a6ce4b0abfb4c8099a8","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"DevelopmentofaG.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["Cari Furiness"],"orgs":["Southeast CSC"],"children":[]},"5644bef8e4b0aafbcd018602":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5016d038e4b06fb5ce8b738e","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Final Memo: Assessment of Terrestrial and Aquatic Monitoring Programs in the Southeastern United States","relatedTitle":"Assessment of Terrestrial and Aquatic Monitoring Programs in the Southeastern United States","id":"5644bef8e4b0aafbcd018602","relatedId":"5016d038e4b06fb5ce8b738e","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5644bef8e4b0aafbcd018602","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Assessment of Terrestrial and Aquatic Monitoring Programs in the Southeastern United States","relatedTitle":"Final Memo: Assessment of Terrestrial and Aquatic Monitoring Programs in the Southeastern United States","id":"5016d038e4b06fb5ce8b738e","relatedId":"5644bef8e4b0aafbcd018602","annotation":null}]},"id":"5644bef8e4b0aafbcd018602","title":"Final Memo: Assessment of Terrestrial and Aquatic Monitoring Programs in the Southeastern United States","body":"Detecting change in ecosystems requires observations of living and non-living components over time. Many different organizations make observations that are relevant to understanding global change processes, but the data are often not easily discoverable by other interested scientists and managers. This aimed to pull into a centralized location information about many of these observational networks. In this phase of the project, a publicly available web-based portal was developed that provides a means to discover, search, and connect to many types of environmental and biological data collected in the southeastern United States that are relevant to characterizing potential effects of climate and land use change on land, water, and wildlife. The Global Change Monitoring Portal (GCMP) consolidates information about data resources from research and monitoring done by federal, state, tribal, local, and non-governmental organizations; it provides opportunities for discovery by users who are land managers, scientists, tribal and other leaders, decision-makers, and citizens. Data resources can be visualized and searched by categories of measurements made and\/or by specific geographic criteria such as state, ecoregion, hydrologic unit, and Landscape Conservation Cooperative. The GCMP provides a mechanism to increase the usefulness of important data collection efforts by a broad range of organizations by making the data more accessible to users.","parentId":"505b62cde4b08c986b30ce61","contacts":[{"name":"Damian Shea","type":"Author","email":"d_shea@ncsu.edu","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Cari Furiness","oldPartyId":62686,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"cari_furiness@ncsu.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Cari","lastName":"Furiness","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Acquisition","dateString":"2015-11-10","label":"Acquisition"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-11-12T09:31:52.468-07:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-21T09:26:36.895-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"other":[{"type":"Acquisition","dateString":"2015-11-10","label":"Acquisition"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-11-12T09:31:52.468-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-21T09:26:36.895-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":1362235,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-11-12T16:42:43.000Z","name":"007 Final Memo Furiness.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__77\/d6\/21\/77d621e38f391a502a17841eede53a72a27fa29c","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5644bef8e4b0aafbcd018602?f=__disk__77%2Fd6%2F21%2F77d621e38f391a502a17841eede53a72a27fa29c"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5644bef8e4b0aafbcd018602","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalMemo_Asses.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["Damian Shea","Cari Furiness"],"children":[]},"53961e50e4b0b4b172cbe7c2":{"relationships":{"total":4,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/544fa631e4b0f97badbc54d8","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Southeast Global Change Monitoring Portal","relatedTitle":"Global Change Monitoring Portal","id":"53961e50e4b0b4b172cbe7c2","relatedId":"544fa631e4b0f97badbc54d8","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5016d038e4b06fb5ce8b738e","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Southeast Global Change Monitoring Portal","relatedTitle":"Assessment of Terrestrial and Aquatic Monitoring Programs in the Southeastern United States","id":"53961e50e4b0b4b172cbe7c2","relatedId":"5016d038e4b06fb5ce8b738e","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/53961e50e4b0b4b172cbe7c2","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Global Change Monitoring Portal","relatedTitle":"Southeast Global Change Monitoring Portal","id":"544fa631e4b0f97badbc54d8","relatedId":"53961e50e4b0b4b172cbe7c2","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/53961e50e4b0b4b172cbe7c2","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Assessment of Terrestrial and Aquatic Monitoring Programs in the Southeastern United States","relatedTitle":"Southeast Global Change Monitoring Portal","id":"5016d038e4b06fb5ce8b738e","relatedId":"53961e50e4b0b4b172cbe7c2","annotation":null}]},"id":"53961e50e4b0b4b172cbe7c2","title":"Southeast Global Change Monitoring Portal","body":"The new&nbsp; \n<a href=\"http:\/\/my.usgs.gov\/gcmp\/\">Southeast Global Change Monitoring Portal<\/a> &nbsp;(GCMP) provides a centralized, comprehensive catalog of observational networks associated with aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in the southeastern United States that may be influenced by climate change.

In support of these efforts, reference points (RPs) are often viewed as critical values of management-relevant indicators. This paper considers RPs from the standpoint of objective-driven decision making in dynamic resource systems, guided by principles of structured decision making (SDM) and adaptive resource management (AM). During the development of natural resource policy, RPs have been variously treated as either \u2018targets\u2019 or \u2018triggers\u2019. Under a SDM\/AM paradigm, target RPs correspond approximately to value-based objectives, which may in turn be either of fundamental interest to stakeholders or intermediaries to other central objectives. By contrast, trigger RPs correspond to decision rules that are presumed to lead to desirable outcomes (such as the programme targets). Casting RPs as triggers or targets within a SDM framework is helpful towards clarifying why (or whether) a particular metric is appropriate. Further, the benefits of a SDM\/AM process include elucidation of underlying untested assumptions that may reveal alternative metrics for use as RPs. Likewise, a structured decision-analytic framework may also reveal that failure to achieve management goals is not because the metrics are wrong, but because the decision-making process in which they are embedded is insufficiently robust to uncertainty, is not efficiently directed at producing a resource objective, or is incapable of adaptation to new knowledge.","parentId":"505b60cfe4b08c986b30c417","contacts":[{"name":"Brian J Irwin","oldPartyId":59296,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"bjirwin@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"AUL-F, Research Fish Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Brian","middleName":"J","lastName":"Irwin","organization":{"displayText":"Gerogia Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"7065428356","streetAddress":{"zip":"30602-0001","country":"US","city":"Athens","state":"GA","line1":"School Of Forest Resources"},"buildingCode":"AYA","name":"Brian J Irwin\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"30602-0001","country":"USA","city":"Athens","state":"GA","line1":"School of Forest Resources, University of Georgia"}}},{"name":"Michael J Conroy","oldPartyId":2023,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"mconroy@usgs.gov","jobTitle":"Assistant Unit Leader Research Wildlife Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J","lastName":"Conroy","organization":{"displayText":"Gerogia Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"7065428356","streetAddress":{"zip":"30602-2152","country":"USA","city":"Athens","state":"GA","line1":"DB Warnell School Of Forest Resources"},"buildingCode":"AYC","name":"Michael J Conroy\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"30602-2152","country":"USA","city":"Athens","state":"GA","line1":"DB Warnell School of Forest Resourc University of Georgia"}}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9060902","title":"Cambridge Journals","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"decision support"},{"name":"natural resource management"},{"name":"structured decision making"},{"name":"uncertainty"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013-06-18","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-07-02T09:59:29.369-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-23T09:56:11.299-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2013","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-07-02T09:59:29.369-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-23T09:56:11.299-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Environmental Conservation ","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI Number","value":"10.1017\/S0376892913000222"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Volume","value":"FirstView"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"ISSN","value":"1469-4387"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Pages","value":"1-8"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["Brian J Irwin","Michael J Conroy"],"orgs":["Southeast CSC"],"children":[]},"57c72ac5e4b0f2f0cebed114":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5016ce88e4b06fb5ce8b737c","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Final Memo: Communicating and Using Uncertain Scientific Information in the Production of \u2018Actionable Science\u2019","relatedTitle":"Communicating and Using Uncertain Scientific Information in the Production of \"Actionable Science\"","id":"57c72ac5e4b0f2f0cebed114","relatedId":"5016ce88e4b06fb5ce8b737c","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/57c72ac5e4b0f2f0cebed114","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Communicating and Using Uncertain Scientific Information in the Production of \"Actionable Science\"","relatedTitle":"Final Memo: Communicating and Using Uncertain Scientific Information in the Production of \u2018Actionable Science\u2019","id":"5016ce88e4b06fb5ce8b737c","relatedId":"57c72ac5e4b0f2f0cebed114","annotation":null}]},"id":"57c72ac5e4b0f2f0cebed114","title":"Final Memo: Communicating and Using Uncertain Scientific Information in the Production of \u2018Actionable Science\u2019","body":"Conservation practitioners must navigate many challenges to advance effective naturalresource management in the presence of multiple uncertainties. Numerous climatic and ecological changes remain on the horizon, and their eventual consequences are not completely understood. Even so, their influences are expected to impact important resources and the people that depend on them across local, regional, and sometimes global scales. Although forecasts of future conditions are almost always imperfect, decision makers are increasingly expected to communicate and use uncertain information when making policy choices that affect multiple user groups. The degree to which management objectives are met can depend on 1) how critical uncertainties are identified and accounted for, and 2) effective communication among user groups, scientists, and resource managers. The objective of this project was to help facilitate strategic decision support and synthesize the state of the science related to communicating and using uncertain information in conservation decision making. By providing a forum on the communication of scientific uncertainty, we traversed traditional disciplinary boundaries, with a focus on climate change in the southeastern United States. We hosted a workshop, which included scholars and practitioners from a variety of fields, produced numerous presentations and a fact sheet to assist resource managers in making decisions in the presence of uncertainty.","parentId":"505b60cfe4b08c986b30c417","contacts":[{"name":"Brian J Irwin","oldPartyId":59296,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"bjirwin@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"AUL-F, Research Fish Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Brian","middleName":"J","lastName":"Irwin","organization":{"displayText":"Gerogia Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"7065428356","officePhone":"7065420790","streetAddress":{"zip":"30602","city":"Athens","state":"GA","line1":"150 University CT, Univ of GA"},"buildingCode":"AYA","name":"Brian J Irwin\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"30602-0001","country":"USA","city":"Athens","state":"GA","line1":"School of Forest Resources, University of Georgia"},"building":"PTX - U of GA-School of For Res-2524"}},{"name":"Clinton Moore","oldPartyId":7133,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"cmoore@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Assistant Unit Leader-Wildife","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Clinton","lastName":"Moore","organization":{"displayText":"Gerogia Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"7065428356","officePhone":"7065421166","streetAddress":{"zip":"30602","city":"Athens","state":"GA","line1":"150 University CT, Univ of GA"},"buildingCode":"AYA","name":"Clinton Moore\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"30602-0001","country":"USA","city":"Athens","state":"GA","line1":"School of Forest Resources, University of Georgia"},"building":"PTX - U of GA-School of For Res-2524"}},{"name":"Meredith Gore","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"tags":[{"name":"Actionable Science"},{"name":"southeastern United States"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2016-08","label":"Date Reported"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-08-31T13:06:45.140-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-05T09:00:25.204-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"other":[{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2016-08","label":"Date Reported"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-08-31T13:06:45.140-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-05T09:00:25.204-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":765888,"useForPreview":false,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"95f427babd296e1651bc3c76467af773"},"dateUploaded":"2016-08-31T18:57:17.000Z","name":"Auctionable Science Final Memo.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__8e\/ab\/76\/8eab76d35eba1e8c4ae9cee51ea1bcb132cdaff0","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/57c72ac5e4b0f2f0cebed114?f=__disk__8e%2Fab%2F76%2F8eab76d35eba1e8c4ae9cee51ea1bcb132cdaff0"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/57c72ac5e4b0f2f0cebed114","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalMemo_Commu.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["Brian J Irwin","Clinton Moore","Meredith Gore"],"children":[]},"579f9c44e4b0589fa1cd558e":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5016ce88e4b06fb5ce8b737c","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Turning Uncertainty Into Useful Information For Conservation Decisions","relatedTitle":"Communicating and Using Uncertain Scientific Information in the Production of \"Actionable Science\"","id":"579f9c44e4b0589fa1cd558e","relatedId":"5016ce88e4b06fb5ce8b737c","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/579f9c44e4b0589fa1cd558e","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Communicating and Using Uncertain Scientific Information in the Production of \"Actionable Science\"","relatedTitle":"Turning Uncertainty Into Useful Information For Conservation Decisions","id":"5016ce88e4b06fb5ce8b737c","relatedId":"579f9c44e4b0589fa1cd558e","annotation":null}]},"id":"579f9c44e4b0589fa1cd558e","title":"Turning Uncertainty Into Useful Information For Conservation Decisions","body":"UNCERTAINTY IS ALWAYS PRESENT in conservation and other socio-ecological decisions, which can make choices uncomfortable and challenging.

One problem for wildlife as their ranges shift is that their path is often impeded by habitat fragmentation. Because of this, the most common recommended strategy to protect wildlife as climate changes is to connect their habitats, providing them safe passage. There are great challenges to implementing this strategy in the southeastern US, however, because most intervening lands between habitat patches are held in private ownership. In partnership with South Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative members, we assessed current and projected connectivity for three species&nbsp;that inhabit bottomland hardwoods throughout the southeastern US:&nbsp;black bear (<em>Ursus americanus)<\/em>, Rafinesque\u2019s big-eared bat (<em>Corynorhinus rafinesquii)<\/em>, and timber rattlesnake (<em>Crotalus horridus<\/em>).&nbsp;For each species, we measured connectivity using three different modeling approaches that incorporated three types of resistance layers. We found that there was not a high degree of overlap between connectivity models for each species, suggesting a limited capacity for \u201cumbrella\u201d estimates of connectivity. Incorporating climate change showed that on average under future climate conditions, linkages decreased in suitability compared to current conditions. These results suggest that, for these three species, connectivity modeling should focus on species-specific traits. Managers should be aware that outcomes of connectivity modeling may be specific to the type of model used, and should potentially consider multiple species planning for connectivity in a region. Climate change is likely to decrease connectivity overall in a species-specific manner and may vary by geographic region.<\/p>","parentId":"5006f8dee4b0abf7ce733fc5","contacts":[{"name":"Nick

Southeastern United States\"","body":"Climate change is already affecting biodiversity, in particular shifting the ranges of species as they move to cooler places. One problem for wildlife as their ranges shift is that their path is often impeded by habitat fragmentation. Because of this, the most common recommended strategy to protect wildlife as climate changes is to connect their habitats, providing them safe passage. There are great challenges to implementing this strategy in the southeastern US, however, because most intervening lands between habitat patches are held in private ownership. In partnership with South Atlantic LCC members, we assessed current and projected connectivity for three species that inhabit bottomland hardwoods throughout the southeastern US:&nbsp;black bear (\n<em>Ursus americanus)<\/em>, Rafinesque\u2019s big-eared bat (\n<em>Corynorhinus rafinesquii)<\/em>, and timber rattlesnake (\n<em>Crotalus horridus<\/em>). &nbsp;For each species, we measured connectivity using three different modeling approaches that incorporated three types of resistance layers. We found that there was not a high degree of overlap between connectivity models for each species, suggesting a limited capacity for \u201cumbrella\u201d estimates of connectivity. Incorporating climate change showed that on average under future climate conditions, linkages decreased in suitability compared to current conditions. These results suggest that, for these three species at least, connectivity modeling should focus on species-specific traits. Managers should be aware that outcomes of connectivity modeling may be specific to the type of model used, and potentially consider multiple species planning for connectivity in a region. Climate change is likely to decrease connectivity overall in a species-specific manner and may vary by geographic region.","parentId":"505b5784e4b08c986b30c211","contacts":[{"name":"Nick Haddad","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"tags":[{"name":"connectivity"},{"name":"Habitats"},{"name":"Urbanization"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2015-06-16","label":"Date Reported"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-07-14T11:00:53.308-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-21T09:06:41.630-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"other":[{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2015-06-16","label":"Date Reported"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-07-14T11:00:53.308-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-21T09:06:41.630-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":1899408,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-07-14T17:00:52.000Z","name":"Final_Report_Haddad_ConnectivityinSE.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__16\/04\/f4\/1604f437dba83cfdabb8e3693f459be74b967f0a","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55a54045e4b0183d66e45477?f=__disk__16%2F04%2Ff4%2F1604f437dba83cfdabb8e3693f459be74b967f0a"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55a54045e4b0183d66e45477","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalMemofor_Co.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["Nick Haddad"],"orgs":["Southeast CSC"],"children":[]},"553006dfe4b0b22a158033ae":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5016c7c7e4b06fb5ce8b7368","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Habitat fragmentation and its lasting impact on Earth\u2019s ecosystems","relatedTitle":"Connectivity for Climate Change in the Southeastern US","id":"553006dfe4b0b22a158033ae","relatedId":"5016c7c7e4b06fb5ce8b7368","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/553006dfe4b0b22a158033ae","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Connectivity for Climate Change in the Southeastern US","relatedTitle":"Habitat fragmentation and its lasting impact on Earth\u2019s ecosystems","id":"5016c7c7e4b06fb5ce8b7368","relatedId":"553006dfe4b0b22a158033ae","annotation":null}]},"id":"553006dfe4b0b22a158033ae","title":"Habitat fragmentation and its lasting impact on Earth\u2019s ecosystems","body":"We conducted an analysis of global forest cover to reveal that 70% of remaining forest is within 1 km of the forest\u2019s edge, subject to the degrading effects of fragmentation. A synthesis of fragmentation experiments spanning multiple biomes and scales, five continents, and 35 years demonstrates that habitat fragmentation reduces biodiversity by 13 to 75% and impairs key ecosystem functions by decreasing biomass and altering nutrient cycles. Effects are greatest in the smallest and most isolated fragments, and they magnify with the passage of time. These findings indicate an urgent need for conservation and restoration measures to improve landscape connectivity, which will reduce extinction rates and help maintain ecosystem services.","parentId":"505b5784e4b08c986b30c211","contacts":[{"name":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Nick M.

The potential ecological impacts of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea-level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). This research investigated the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea-level rise and carbon storage.<br>\n<br>\nCollectively, results from this project indicate that interactions between winter temperatures and rainfall influence the above- and below-ground ecological implications of poleward mangrove forest expansion and development in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Looking more broadly, these findings reinforce the importance of considering interactions between multiple climatic drivers when attempting to predict the ecological implications of climate-induced ecological transitions, especially those that involve woody plants encroaching into grass-dominated ecosystems. The data and publications from this work can help environmental managers and decision makers plan and prepare for future change in coastal wetland

impact on coastal wetlands in the southeastern U.S. Warmer winter temperatures and reductions in the intensity of freeze events would likely lead to mangrove forest range expansion and salt marsh displacement in parts of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast. The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage.

The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services. This file includes the site-level synthesis of all ecosystem data. This work was conducted vie a collaborative effort between scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey National Wetland Research Center and the Department of Biology of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.","purpose":"Winter climate change has the potential to have a large impact on coastal wetlands in the southeastern U.S. Warmer winter temperatures and reductions in the intensity of freeze events would likely lead to mangrove forest range expansion and salt marsh displacement in parts of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast.

Across the globe, species distributions are changing in response to climate change and land use change. In parts of the southeastern United States, climate change is expected to result in the poleward range expansion of black mangroves ( \n<em>Avicennia germinans<\/em>) at the expense of some salt marsh vegetation. The morphology of \n<em>A. germinans<\/em> at its northern range limit is more shrub-like than in tropical climes in part due to the aboveground structural damage and vigorous multi-stem regrowth triggered by extreme winter temperatures. In this study, we developed aboveground allometric equations for freeze-affected black mangroves which can be used to quantify: (1) total aboveground biomass; (2) leaf biomass; (3) stem plus branch biomass; and (4) leaf area. Plant volume (i.e., a combination of crown area and plant height) was selected as the optimal predictor of the four response variables. We expect that our simple measurements and equations can be adapted for use in other mangrove ecosystems located in abiotic settings that result in mangrove individuals with dwarf or shrub-like morphologies including oligotrophic and arid environments. Many important ecological functions and services are affected by changes in coastal wetland plant community structure and productivity including carbon storage, nutrient cycling, coastal protection, recreation, fish and avian habitat, and ecosystem response to sea level rise and extreme climatic events. Coastal scientists in the southeastern United States can use the identified allometric equations, in combination with easily obtained and non-destructive plant volume measurements, to better quantify and monitor ecological change within the dynamic, climate sensitive, and highly-productive mangrove-marsh ecotone.","parentId":"505b584fe4b08c986b30c22f","contacts":[{"name":"Public Library of

rise: Considering macroclimatic drivers within coastal wetland vulnerability assessments to climate change","body":"<p>Due to their position at the land-sea interface, coastal wetlands are vulnerable to many aspects of climate change. However, climate change vulnerability assessments for coastal wetlands generally focus solely on sea-level rise without considering the effects of other facets of climate change. Across the globe and in all ecosystems, macroclimatic drivers (e.g., temperature and rainfall regimes) greatly influence ecosystem structure and function. Macroclimatic drivers have been the focus of climate-change related threat evaluations for terrestrial ecosystems, but largely ignored for coastal wetlands. In some coastal wetlands, changing macroclimatic conditions are expected to result in foundation plant species replacement, which would affect the supply of certain ecosystem goods and services and could affect ecosystem resilience. As examples, we highlight several ecological transition zones where small changes in macroclimatic conditions would result in comparatively large changes in coastal wetland ecosystem structure and function. Our intent in this communication is not to minimize the importance of sea-level rise. Rather, our overarching aim is to illustrate the need to also consider macroclimatic drivers within vulnerability assessments for coastal wetlands.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["505b584fe4b08c986b30c22f","52254414e4b0e4746d62aff7"],"contacts":[{"name":"Michael J.

In this study, we examined the influence of freshwater availability upon the coverage of foundation plant species in coastal wetlands along a northwestern Gulf of Mexico rainfall gradient. Our research addresses the following three questions: (1) what are the region-scale relationships between measures of freshwater availability (e.g., rainfall, aridity, freshwater inflow, salinity) and the relative abundance of foundation plant species in tidal wetlands; (2) How vulnerable are foundation plant species in tidal wetlands to future changes in freshwater availability; and (3) What is the potential future relative abundance of tidal wetland foundation plant species under alternative climate change scenarios? We developed simple freshwater availability-based models to predict the relative abundance (i.e., coverage) of tidal wetland foundation plant species using climate data (1970-2000), estuarine freshwater inflow-focused data, and coastal wetland habitat data. Our results identify regional ecological thresholds and nonlinear relationships between measures of freshwater availability and the relative abundance of foundation plant species in tidal wetlands. In drier coastal zones, relatively small changes in rainfall could produce comparatively large landscape-scale changes in foundation plant species abundance which would affect some ecosystem good and services. Whereas a drier future would result in a decrease in the coverage of foundation plant species, a wetter future would result in an increase in foundation plant species coverage. In many ways, the freshwater-dependent coastal wetland ecological transitions we observed are analogous to those present in dryland terrestrial ecosystems.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["505b584fe4b08c986b30c22f","52254414e4b0e4746d62aff7"],"contacts":[{"name":"Michael J.

The greatest threats to mangrove persistence are deforestation and other anthropogenic disturbances that can compromise habitat stability and resilience to sea-level rise. To persist, mangrove ecosystems must adjust to rising sea level by building vertically or become submerged. Mangroves may directly or indirectly influence soil accretion processes through the production and accumulation of organic matter, as well as the trapping and retention of mineral sediment. In this review, we provide a general overview of research on mangrove elevation dynamics, emphasizing the role of the vegetation in maintaining soil surface elevations (i.e. position of the soil surface in the vertical plane). We summarize the primary ways in which mangroves may influence sediment accretion and vertical land development, for example, through root contributions to soil volume and upward expansion of the soil surface. We also examine how hydrological, geomorphological and climatic processes may interact with plant processes to influence mangrove capacity to keep pace with rising sea level. We draw on a variety of studies to describe the important, and often under-appreciated, role that plants play in shaping the trajectory of an ecosystem undergoing change.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["505b584fe4b08c986b30c22f"],"contacts":[{"name":"Ken W.

Since some ecosystem goods and services would be affected by mangrove range expansion, there is a need to better understand mangrove sensitivity to freezing temperatures as well as the implications of changing winter climate extremes for mangrove-salt marsh interactions. In this study, we investigated the following questions: (1) how does plant life stage (i.e., ontogeny) influence the resistance and resilience of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) forests to freezing temperatures; and (2) how might differential life stage responses to freeze events affect the rate of mangrove expansion and salt marsh displacement due to climate change? To address these questions, we quantified freeze damage and recovery for different life stages (seedling, short tree, and tall tree) following extreme winter air temperature events that occurred near the northern range limit of A. germinans in North America. We found that life stage affects black mangrove forest resistance and resilience to winter climate extremes in a nonlinear fashion. Resistance to winter climate extremes was high for tall A. germinans trees and seedlings, but lowest for short trees. Resilience was highest for tall A. germinans trees. These results suggest the presence of positive feedbacks and indicate that climate-change induced decreases in the frequency and intensity of extreme minimum air temperatures could lead to a nonlinear increase in mangrove forest resistance and resilience. This feedback could accelerate future mangrove expansion and salt marsh loss at rates beyond what would be predicted from climate change alone. In general terms, our study highlights the importance of accounting for differential life stage responses and positive feedbacks when evaluating the ecological effects of changes in the frequency and magnitude of climate extremes.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["505b584fe4b08c986b30c22f"],"contacts":[{"name":"Michael J.

Although mangroves and marshes are both highly valued ecosystems, the ecological implications of mangrove expansion have not been fully investigated.<\/p> \n<p>2.Here we examined the effects of mangrove expansion on below-ground properties related to peat development and carbon storage.

Marsh species composition, marsh above-ground biomass, and mangrove forest structural complexity also varied across these locations. Marshes in the driest location (Central Texas) had higher salinities and were dominated by low biomass succulent plants and lower soil carbon pools. Marshes in the wetter, less saline locations (Louisiana and North Florida) contained high biomass grasses and higher soil carbon pools.<\/p> \n<p>4.At all locations, above-ground biomass and above-ground carbon pools were higher in mangroves than marshes; however, below-ground soil carbon pools were only higher in mangroves than marshes in the driest location. In the wetter locations, the linkages between mangrove forest structure and soil properties were minimal or not significant. However, in the driest location, there was a significant increase in soil properties related to peat development and carbon storage with increased mangrove forest structural development.<\/p> \n<p>5.<em>Synthesis<\/em>: Our results indicate that the ecological implications of woody plant encroachment in tidal saline wetlands are dependent upon precipitation controls of plant-soil interactions. Although the above-ground effects of mangrove expansion are consistently large, below-ground influences of mangrove expansion appear to be greatest along low-rainfall coasts where salinities are high and marshes being replaced are carbon poor and dominated by succulent plants. Collectively, these findings complement those from terrestrial ecosystems and reinforce the importance of considering rainfall and plant-soil interactions within predictions of the ecological effects of woody plant encroachment.<\/p>","parentId":"505b584fe4b08c986b30c22f","contacts":[{"name":"Erik S Yando","oldPartyId":69339,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"eyando@usgs.gov","jobTitle":"Intern","firstName":"Erik","middleName":"S","lastName":"Yando","organization":{"displayText":"University of Louisiana at Lafayette"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"3372668500","streetAddress":{"zip":"70506","country":"US","city":"Lafayette","state":"LA","line1":"700 Cajundome Blvd"},"buildingCode":"KFA","name":"CN=Erik S Yando,OU=Users,OU=LafayetteLA-B,OU=LafayetteLA-M,OU=CR,DC=gs,DC=doi,DC=net - Primary Location","mailAddress":[],"building":"NWRC - Office\/LAb Building"}},{"name":"Michael J Osland","oldPartyId":57822,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"mosland@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J","lastName":"Osland","organization":{"displayText":"USGS National Wetlands Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"3372668664","streetAddress":{"zip":"70506","city":"Lafayette","state":"LA","line1":"700 Cajundome Blvd"},"buildingCode":"KFA","name":"Michael J Osland\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"70506","country":"USA","city":"Lafayette","state":"LA","line1":"700 Cajundome Blvd."},"building":"WARC - Office\/LAb Building"}},{"name":"Jonathan M.

Typically, the ability of coastal marshes to maintain their position in the intertidal zone depends on the accumulation of both organic and inorganic materials, so one, if not both, of these processes must increase to keep pace with rising seas, assuming all else constant. To determine the importance of vegetation in these processes, we measured elevation change and surface accretion over a 4-year period in recently subsided, unvegetated marshes, resulting from drought-induced marsh dieback, in paired planted and unplanted plots. We compared soil and vegetation responses in these plots with paired reference plots that had neither experienced dieback nor subsidence. All treatments (unvegetated, planted, and reference) were replicated six times. The recently subsided areas were 6\u201310&nbsp;cm lower in elevation than the reference marshes at the beginning of the study; thus, mean water levels were 6\u201310&nbsp;cm higher in these areas vs. the reference sites. Surface accretion rates were lowest in the unplanted plots at 2.3&nbsp;mm&nbsp;yr\u22121, but increased in the presence of vegetation to 16.4&nbsp;mm&nbsp;yr\u22121&nbsp;in the reference marsh and 26.1&nbsp;mm&nbsp;yr\u22121&nbsp;in the planted plots. The rates of elevation change were also bolstered by the presence of vegetation. The unplanted areas decreased in elevation by 9.4&nbsp;mm&nbsp;yr\u22121; whereas the planted areas increased in elevation by 13.3&nbsp;mm&nbsp;yr\u22121, and the reference marshes increased by 3.5&nbsp;mm&nbsp;yr\u22121. These results highlight the importance of vegetation in the accretionary processes that maintain marsh surface elevation within the intertidal zone, and provide evidence that coastal wetlands may be able to keep pace with a rising sea in certain situations.","parentId":"505b584fe4b08c986b30c22f","contacts":[{"name":"Baustian, Joseph J.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Mendelssohn, Irving A.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Hester, Mark W.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2486.2012.02792.x\/abstract","title":"Abstract Text Link","hidden":false},{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2486.2012.02792.x\/full","title":"Full Text Link","hidden":false},{"type":"pdf","typeLabel":"PDF Download","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2486.2012.02792.x\/pdf","title":"Publication PDF","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Accretion"},{"name":"Coastal wetland"},{"name":"elevation change"},{"name":"sea level rise"},{"name":"SET"},{"name":"Spartina alterniflora"},{"name":"subsidence"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2012-08-27","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-12-10T11:17:01.833-07:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-23T14:21:59.729-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2012","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-12-10T11:17:01.833-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-23T14:21:59.729-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Global Change Biology","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1111\/j.1365-2486.2012.02792.x"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"startPage","value":"3377"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issn","value":"1365-2486"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issue","value":"11"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"endPage","value":"3382"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"volume","value":"18"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["Baustian, Joseph J.","Mendelssohn, Irving A.","Hester, Mark W."],"orgs":["Southeast CSC"],"children":[]},"5351706ee4b05569d805a44a":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5016c89be4b06fb5ce8b736a","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Water use characteristics of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) communities along an ecotone with marsh at a northern geographical limit","relatedTitle":"Ecological Implications of Mangrove Forest Migration in the Southeastern U.S.","id":"5351706ee4b05569d805a44a","relatedId":"5016c89be4b06fb5ce8b736a","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5351706ee4b05569d805a44a","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Ecological Implications of Mangrove Forest Migration in the Southeastern U.S.","relatedTitle":"Water use characteristics of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) communities along an ecotone with marsh at a northern geographical limit","id":"5016c89be4b06fb5ce8b736a","relatedId":"5351706ee4b05569d805a44a","annotation":null}]},"id":"5351706ee4b05569d805a44a","title":"Water use characteristics of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) communities along an ecotone with marsh at a northern geographical limit","body":"Mangroves are expanding into warm temperate-zone salt marsh communities in several locations globally. Although scientists have discovered that expansion might have modest effects on ecosystem functioning, water use characteristics have not been assessed relative to this transition. We measured early growing season sapflow (J<sub>s<\/sub>) and leaf transpiration (T<sub>r<\/sub>) in Avicennia germinans at a latitudinal limit along the northern Gulf of Mexico (Louisiana, United States) under both flooded and drained states and used these data to scale vegetation water use responses in comparison with Spartina alterniflora.

When T<sub>r<\/sub> data were combined with leaf area indices for the region with the use of three separate approaches, we determined that Avicennia stands use approximately 1\u00b70\u20131\u00b73\u2009mm\u2009d<sup>\u20131<\/sup> less water than Spartina marsh.

In this study, we investigated the potential effect of winter climate change upon salt marsh and mangrove forest foundation species in the southeastern United States. Our research addresses the following three questions: (1) What is the relationship between winter climate and the presence and abundance of mangrove forests relative to salt marshes; (2) How vulnerable are salt marshes to winter climate change-induced mangrove forest range expansion; and (3) What is the potential future distribution and relative abundance of mangrove forests under alternative winter climate change scenarios? We developed simple winter climate-based models to predict mangrove forest distribution and relative abundance using observed winter temperature data (1970\u20132000) and mangrove forest and salt marsh habitat data. Our results identify winter climate thresholds for salt marsh\u2013mangrove forest interactions and highlight coastal areas in the southeastern United States (e.g., Texas, Louisiana, and parts of Florida) where relatively small changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme winter events could cause relatively dramatic landscape-scale ecosystem structural and functional change in the form of poleward mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The ecological implications of these marsh-to-mangrove forest conversions are poorly understood, but would likely include changes for associated fish and wildlife populations and for the supply of some ecosystem goods and services.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["505b584fe4b08c986b30c22f"],"contacts":[{"name":"Michael J.

To accomplish this goal, we completed a thorough synthesis and evaluation of hydrologic modeling efforts in the Southeast region (including all states of the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (SEAFWA) including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia) and Puerto Rico. Because this modeling synthesis was performed comprehensively and using a consistent methodology, it will provide landscape conservation cooperatives (LCCs) and other resource managers with a useful

Integrated modeling approaches assessing the impact of changes in climate, land use, and water withdrawals on stream flows and the subsequent impact of changes in flow regime on aquatic biota at multiple spatial scales are necessary to insure an adequate supply of water for humans and healthy river ecosystems. This report inventories and then directly examines and compares a subset of hydrological models implemented in the Southeastern US that were used to estimate streamflow at a number of gaged basins across the region. This effort was designed to evaluate, quantify and compare the magnitude, and investigate the potential causes of error, associated with predicted streamflows from seven hydrologic models of varying complexity and calibration strategy. This was accomplished by computing and then comparing classical hydrologic model fit statistics (e.g., mean bias, coefficient of determination, root mean squared error, NSE), and understanding the bias in the prediction in these and a subset of ecologically relevant flow metrics (ERFM).This spreadsheet contains model fit statistics for the model comparison workshop across 195 USGS streamflow gauges in the southeast. Descriptions of the models included are detailed in the final report.","purpose":"Included sheets in this spreadsheet are as follows. 1) data dictionary- descriptions of all variables in this database; 2) site summary- List of the streamflow gauges, including basin drainage area and screening comments for hydrologic alteration; 3) fit stats-daily- Model fit statistics to observed daily flows for daily timestep models only; 4) fit stats-monthly- Model fit statistics to observed monthly flows for all models; 5) fit stats-annual- Model fit statistics to observed annual flows for all models.; 6) bias mean monthly- Bias in predicted monthly mean flows relative to observed for all models; 7) bias ERFM 5 sites 5 models- Bias in predicted Ecologically Relevant Flow Metrics relative to observed HSPF, PRMS-DAYMET, PRMS-SERAP, SWAT, and WATERFALL models at five sites in the ACF basin.","parentId":"505b5ef2e4b08c986b30c26e","contacts":[{"name":"Peter Caldwell, PhD","type":"Point of Contact","contactType":"person","email":"pcaldwell02@fs.fed.us","organization":{"displayText":"Forest Service Center for Forest Watershed Research, Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, Southern Research Station"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"828-524-2128 x124","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"28763","country":"U.S.A","city":"Otto","state":"North Carolina","line1":"3160 Coweeta Lab Road"}}},{"name":"Peter Caldwell","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Peter Caldwell, PhD","type":"Metadata Contact","contactType":"person","email":"pcaldwell02@fs.fed.us","organization":{"displayText":"Forest Service Center for Forest Watershed Research, Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, Southern Research Station"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"828-369-6768","officePhone":"828-524-2128","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"28763","city":"Otto","state":"North Carolina","line1":"3160 Coweeta Lab Road"}}},{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey -

We assessed differences in daily streamflow predictions by four fine-scale models and two regional-scale monthly time step models by comparing model fit statistics and bias in ecologically relevant flow statistics (ERFSs) at five sites in the Southeastern USA. Models were calibrated to different extents, including uncalibrated (level A), calibrated to a downstream site (level B), calibrated specifically for the site (level C) and calibrated for the site with adjusted precipitation and temperature inputs (level D). All models generally captured the magnitude and variability of observed streamflows at the five study sites, and increasing level of model calibration generally improved performance. All models had at least 1 of 14 ERFSs falling outside a +\/\u221230% range of hydrologic uncertainty at every site, and ERFSs related to low flows were frequently over-predicted. Our results do not indicate that any specific hydrologic model is superior to the others evaluated at all sites and for all measures of model performance. Instead, we provide evidence that (1) model performance is as likely to be related to calibration strategy as it is to model structure and (2) simple, regional-scale models have comparable performance to the more complex, fine-scale models at a monthly time step.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["505b5ef7e4b08c986b30c270"],"contacts":[{"name":"Peter V Caldwell","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Jonathan G.

Southeast United States: evaluation and use for ecological applications","body":"Climate change is likely to have many effects on natural ecosystems in the Southeast U.S. The National Climate Assessment Southeast Technical Report (SETR) indicates that natural ecosystems in the Southeast are likely to be affected by warming temperatures, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and changes in rainfall and evapotranspiration. To better assess these how climate changes could affect multiple sectors, including ecosystems, climatologists have created several downscaled climate projections (or downscaled datasets) that contain information from the global climate models (GCMs) translated to regional or local scales. The process of creating these downscaled datasets, known as downscaling, can be carried out using a broad range of statistical or numerical modeling techniques. The rapid proliferation of techniques that can be used for downscaling and the number of downscaled datasets produced in recent years present many challenges for scientists and decisionmakers in assessing the impact or vulnerability of a given species or ecosystem to climate change. Given the number of available downscaled datasets, how do these model outputs compare to each other? Which variables are available, and are certain downscaled datasets more appropriate for assessing vulnerability of a particular species? Given the desire to use these datasets for impact and vulnerability assessments and the lack of comparison between these datasets, the goal of this report is to synthesize the information available in these downscaled datasets and provide guidance to scientists and natural resource managers with specific interests in ecological modeling and conservation planning related to climate change in the Southeast U.S. This report enables the Southeast Climate Science Center (SECSC) to address an important strategic goal of providing scientific information and guidance that will enable resource managers and other participants in Landscape Conservation Cooperatives to make science-based climate change adaptation decisions.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["505b5dc8e4b08c986b30c260"],"contacts":[{"name":"Adrienne Wootten","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Kara Smith","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Ryan Boyles","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Adam Terando","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"aterando@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Lydia Stefanova","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Vasru Misra","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Tom Smith","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"David L.

However, before the impact of projected climate changes on crop production can be addressed, a necessary first step is the assessment of the inherent uncertainty and limitations of the forcing data used in these crop models. In this paper, we evaluate the simulated crop production using separate crop models for maize (summer crop) and wheat (winter crop) over six different locations in the Southeastern United States forced with multiple sources of actual and simulated weather data. The paper compares the crop production simulated by a crop model for maize and wheat during a historical period, using daily weather data from three sources: station observations, dynamically downscaled global reanalysis, and dynamically downscaled historical climate model simulations from two global circulation models (GCMs). The same regional climate model is used to downscale the global reanalysis and both global circulation models\u2019 historical simulation. The average simulated yield derived from bias-corrected downscaled reanalysis or bias-corrected downscaled GCMs were, in most cases, not statistically different from observations. Statistical differences of the average yields, generated from observed or downscaled GCM weather, were found in some locations under rainfed and irrigated scenarios, and more frequently in winter (wheat) than in summer (maize). The inter-annual variance of simulated crop yield using GCM downscaled data was frequently overestimated, especially in summer. An analysis of the bias-corrected climate data showed that despite the agreement between the modeled and the observed means of temperatures, solar radiation, and precipitation, their intra-seasonal variances were often significantly different from observations. Therefore, due to this high intra-seasonal variability, a cautious approach is required when using climate model data for historical yield analysis and future climate change impact assessments.","parentId":"505b5dc8e4b08c986b30c260","contacts":[{"name":"Davide Cammarano","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Florida"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Lydia Stefanova","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Florida State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Brenda V.

To better assess how climate change could affect multiple sectors, including ecosystems, climatologists have created several downscaled climate projections that contain information from GCMs translated to regional or local scales. There are a number of techniques that can be used to create downscaled climate projections, and the number of available downscaled climate projections present challenges to users deciding what to use in their applications. The goals of this project were to assess the needs to ecologists in the Southeast U.S. for downscaled climate projections, synthesize the information available, and evaluate a selection of downscaled climate projections based upon the needs of the ecological community in the Southeast. The report produced is a guide which enables the Southeast Climate Science Center to address an important strategic goal of providing scientific information and guidance that will enable resource managers and others in the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives to make science-based climate change adaptation decisions.","purpose":"The information synthesis and evaluation of downscaled projections across the Southeast is necessary to\nprovide guidance to users of downscaled projections. This is necessary to provide guidance on the\ncreation and appropriate use of downscaled projections. While this has been considered broadly in the\nclimate science community, it is necessary to consider this with regards to the specific information needs\nof ecologists and natural resource managers in the Southeast. As such the main objective of the project\nwas to summarize the methods and approaches used to appropriately downscale coarse climate model\nguidance for use at local scales, identify the metrics most appropriate for evaluation of climate model skill\nand usability of climate model projections for the ecology and conservation communities, and being a\nlonger-term effort to evaluate a collection of downscaled climate products over the Southeastern United\nStates.\nWe were able to address the objectives proposed. There were no major differences between what was\nproposed and the resulting work. The resulting report summarized the strengths and weaknesses of the\nmany kinds of downscaling techniques, including previous literature on the accuracy of such techniques\nand the influence on the guidance provided by output datasets created with such techniques. The initial\nevaluation of several downscaled climate projections begins the longer-term evaluation effort proposed.\nIn addition to beginning this effort, the evaluation and associated narrative describes the considerations\nthat an ecologist or natural resource manager should take before choosing a downscaled climate\nprojection to use in their impact assessment or decision.","parentId":"505b5dc8e4b08c986b30c260","contacts":[{"name":"Ryan Boyles","oldPartyId":64939,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"ryan_boyles@ncsu.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Boyles","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southeast Climate Science Center","oldPartyId":59608,"type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","active":true,"aliases":["Southeast CSC","SECSC","NCCWSC SE (CSC)"],"fbmsCodes":["GGHCEN0502","GGHCGR0502"],"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"Southeast Climate Science Center -

The development of adaptation strategies that respond to anthropogenic climate change for the CLCC, and particularly for Puerto Rico, is currently hindered by the lack of local-scale climate scenarios that resolve the complex topographical and meso-scale climate features that will mediate the island-wide response to the global anthropogenic climate forcing. The research team proposes to address these issues by developing a suite of dynamically downscaled, nonhydrostatic climate model projections for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Caribbean region. The framework provides a unique opportunity to examine climate change impacts on island ecosystems in a region of the global tropics with a highly dynamic climate regime. The resulting simulations will fill a critical need for climate change information in Puerto Rico and the broader U.S. Caribbean by enabling future estimates of likely deviations from known ranges of species\u2019 thermal\/moisture optima. This proposed work furthers scientific understanding of local responses to global climate change and lays the foundation for a decision analytic approach to climate adaptation in the Caribbean LCC.

Making land acquisition choices for a large, terrestrial protected area is difficult because it occurs over a long timeframe and may involve consideration of future conditions such as climate and urbanization changes. Decision makers need to consider factors including: order of parcel purchasing given budget constraints, future uncertainty, potential future landscape-scale changes from urbanization, and climate. In central Florida, two new refuges and the expansion of a third refuge are in various stages of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) planning. The Everglades Headwaters National Wildlife Refuge (EHNWR) has recently been established, is at the top of the Presidential Administration\u2019s priority conservation areas, and has been cited by the Secretary of Interior routinely in the context of conservation. The new refuges were strategically located for both species adaptation from climate change impacts as well as currently hosting a number of important threatened and endangered species and habitats. For this study we combined a structured decision making framework, optimal solution theory, and output from urbanization models that provide forecasts of population growth that might be expected due to climate change, and provide guidance for EHNWR reserve design. Utilizing a SDM approach and optimal solution theory, we used stakeholder-determined objectives to design optimal configurations for the refuge and help FWS in land acquisition prioritization.<\/div>\n","purpose":"The SSURGO maps were developed at a local level, by SCS staff assigned to each county. They were designed primarily for natural resource management by \"farm and ranch, landowner\/user, township, county, or parish\". With the advent of GIS the data can also be used for larger regional analysis. Intended applications included \"determining erodible areas and developing erosion control practices, reviewing site development proposals and land use potential; making land use assessments and chemical fate assessments; and identifying potential wetlands and sand and gravel aquifer areas.\" SSURGO maps have the highest level of field verification of the state or federal level natural resource maps. For that reason they are valuable as ancillary information for related map products, such as wetlands, land use, and vegetation maps. SSURGO maps are also valuable as an historical reference, because the soils are relatively stable compared to other themes such as land use or hydrography, and the NRCS attempts to show both current and historical status in the maps.","parentId":"526eaacce4b044919baee8fd","contacts":[{"name":"Stephanie S Romanach","oldPartyId":8766,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"sromanach@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Stephanie","middleName":"S","lastName":"Romanach","cellPhone":"7542646060","organization":{"displayText":"Southeast Ecological Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9544754125","officePhone":"9542361055","streetAddress":{"zip":"33314","city":"Fort Lauderdale","state":"FL","line1":"3205 College Ave"},"buildingCode":"AAF","name":"Stephanie S Romanach\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"33314-7799","country":"USA","city":"Davie","state":"FL","line1":"3205 College Ave."},"building":"University of Fl.

Making land acquisition choices for a large, terrestrial protected area is difficult because it occurs over a long timeframe and may involve consideration of future conditions such as climate and urbanization changes. Decision makers need to consider factors including: order of parcel purchasing given budget constraints, future uncertainty, potential future landscape-scale changes from urbanization and climate. In central Florida, two new refuges and the expansion of a third refuge are in various stages of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) planning. The Everglades Headwaters National Wildlife Refuge (EHNWR) has recently been established, is at the top of the Presidential Administration\u2019s priority conservation areas, and has been cited by the Secretary of Interior routinely in the context of conservation. The new refuges were strategically located for both species adaptation from climate change impacts as well as currently hosting a number of important threatened and endangered species and habitats. For this study we combined a structured decision making framework, optimal solution theory, and output from urbanization models that provide forecasts of population growth that might be expected due to climate change, and provide guidance for EHNWR reserve design. Utilizing a SDM approach and optimal solution theory, we used stakeholder-determined objectives to design optimal configurations for the refuge and help FWS in land acquisition prioritization.","parentId":"5224e53ce4b0e4746d62af69","contacts":[{"name":"Stephanie S Romanach","oldPartyId":8766,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"sromanach@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Stephanie","middleName":"S","lastName":"Romanach","cellPhone":"7542646060","organization":{"displayText":"Southeast Ecological Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9544754125","officePhone":"9542361055","streetAddress":{"zip":"33314","city":"Fort Lauderdale","state":"FL","line1":"3205 College Ave"},"buildingCode":"AAF","name":"Stephanie S Romanach\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"33314-7799","country":"USA","city":"Davie","state":"FL","line1":"3205 College Ave."},"building":"University of Fl.

This evaluation can be used as one source of information when a user is faced with selecting a small number of climate projections from the larger set of available projections for an impacts assessment.&nbsp;Collectively, the guidance on the credibility of GCMs over the southeastern US and the downscaled datasets provide necessary information and data to develop strategies for coping with climate change.","parentId":"526ebad5e4b044919baf0d73","contacts":[{"name":"Philip Mote","type":"Author","email":"pmote@coas.oregonstate.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Phil","lastName":"Mote","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"David Rupp","oldPartyId":64913,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"drupp@coas.oregonstate.edu","active":true,"firstName":"David","lastName":"Rupp","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southeast Climate Science Center","oldPartyId":59608,"type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","active":true,"aliases":["Southeast CSC","SECSC","NCCWSC SE (CSC)"],"fbmsCodes":["GGHCEN0502","GGHCGR0502"],"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"Southeast Climate Science Center - Location","mailAddress":[]}}],"browseTypes":["Report"],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Acquisition","dateString":"2015-11-04","label":"Acquisition Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-11-04T12:38:42.288-07:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-21T08:20:12.679-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"other":[{"type":"Acquisition","dateString":"2015-11-04","label":"Acquisition Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-11-04T12:38:42.288-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-21T08:20:12.679-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":1074981,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-11-04T19:31:42.000Z","name":"016 Final Memo Mote.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__1f\/7e\/92\/1f7e921693b2e7b08a14fcf8972c3aa6dcf68e24","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/563a5ec2e4b0d6133fe7340f?f=__disk__1f%2F7e%2F92%2F1f7e921693b2e7b08a14fcf8972c3aa6dcf68e24"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/563a5ec2e4b0d6133fe7340f","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalMemoforEva.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["Philip Mote","David Rupp"],"orgs":["Southeast Climate Science Center"],"children":[]},"5752f2d9e4b053f0edd15628":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/526eba4fe4b044919baf0d6d","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) CMIP5 Statistically Downscaled Data for Coterminous USA","relatedTitle":"Evaluation and Downscaling of CMIP5 Climate Simulations for the Southeast U.S.","id":"5752f2d9e4b053f0edd15628","relatedId":"526eba4fe4b044919baf0d6d","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5752f2d9e4b053f0edd15628","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Evaluation and Downscaling of CMIP5 Climate Simulations for the Southeast U.S.","relatedTitle":"Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) CMIP5 Statistically Downscaled Data for Coterminous USA","id":"526eba4fe4b044919baf0d6d","relatedId":"5752f2d9e4b053f0edd15628","annotation":null}]},"id":"5752f2d9e4b053f0edd15628","title":"Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) CMIP5 Statistically Downscaled Data for Coterminous USA","body":"NOTICE: Given the large size of the MACAv2METDATA dataset, and a known issue with the data server being used to host it, initial load times may take a very long time and \/ or time out.

Coastal Improvements Program (MsCIP), the US Army Corps of Engineers will place up to 22 million&nbsp;cubic yards (MCY) of sand to restore the physical integrity of Ship Island.

In this project, structured decision making (SDM) was utilized to provide a formal process for analyzing decisions about repairing storm-related damages that may arise during island construction to maximize post-construction sustainability of the restoration effort.&nbsp;Decision support tools were developed to link restoration objectives and management options while accounting for tradeoffs between objectives and uncertainties such as storm events during and after construction. Expert elicitations, predictive models, and quantitative analysis were incorporated into a decision network to represent the relationships between storm impacts on the constructed island footprint (i.e., breaching, narrowing, and\/or lowering) and consequences for restoration objectives including mitigation of shoaling; wave attenuation; avoiding loss of habitat for sea turtles, shorebirds, and Gulf Sturgeon; maintaining salinity levels in Mississippi Sound; and preserving funds for subsequent MsCIP restoration projects. The SDM process yielded not only management recommendations that could be quickly and effectively implemented during the Ship Island construction, but it also led to a general decision framework and process that could be expanded and adapted for use by future barrier island and restoration projects.&nbsp;","purpose":"Barrier island resource managers within the northern Gulf of Mexico need to more directly incorporate scientific uncertainties and technological challenges inherent with large-scale barrier island restoration projects, and as such, have committed to developing a robust long-term monitoring program and applying adaptive management.  These managers want to determine project success in accordance with stated project objectives, and also address critical uncertainties that would inform future decisions on design templates and island performance.  They are looking for a process that can help develop adaptive management actions and tools to guide adaptive decision-making within the context of project construction, maintenance, and future prioritization of conservation actions. SDM is a collaborative process that includes stakeholders and scientists to define management objectives, alternative actions, external drivers, predictive models, and quantitative methods for optimization and tradeoff analysis to identify optimal decisions and key uncertainties to be addressed through further gathering of information (Conroy and Peterson 2012 and Gregory et al., 2012). Under the MsCIP program, SDM was applied to the Barrier Island Restoration on Ship Island to provide a formal, transparent and replicable process for analyzing decisions about repairing storm-related damages that may arise during island construction to help support their existing AM program. \nThe original objective of the project was to use SDM for developing a shared conservation framework and vision of comprehensive barrier island restoration planning, implementation, and assessment in the face of climate change within the northern Gulf of Mexico, using the MsCIP Barrier Island Restoration at Ship Island as a case study.  A decision tool tied to various future barrier island system conditions associated with estimating sand loss volumes and costs of repair was designed for the MsCIP to ensure management decisions optimize the sustainability of the constructed barrier island project while also accounting for stakeholder input and uncertainty about future system change (i.e. potential storm related damages).  This process established a framework to make defensible, transparent, efficient and coordinated decisions to optimize barrier island restoration at Ship Island in the Gulf of Mexico. The developed framework provided a template that could be expanded and carried forward providing opportunities to refine to specific adaptive management needs for other projects and programs in the future.\nDuring the development of the proposal the original intent was to use the MsCIP as a case study for development of a prototype decision making tool for barrier island restoration and conservation in the northern Gulf of Mexico.

Barrier island restoration typically involves placement of sediment either directly on the island footprint or within the littoral zone for system transport and distribution. The re-engineering of barrier islands presents numerous challenges and uncertainties associated with climate change induced hurricanes\/storms and other dynamic components of the system such as sediment availability and erosional trends. The goal of this study was to use a collaborative SDM approach to develop two Bayesian decision network models (DMs) for restoration at Ship Island, Mississippi, where sand will be used to close an extensive breach. The team identified what damage may occur during construction, and the DMs guided decisions within the confines of limited sand and money to select actions that minimized adverse impacts to project objectives. DM input was derived from expert elicitation and augmented with inundation data. The first DM determined that sand was more limiting than funds, and unrepaired major breaching would negatively impact project objectives. The second DM addressed if, how, and when to repair more minor damage, depending on the extent it is more cost-effective to repair immediately than risk more damage to the weakened project. SDM was applied to four phases of Barrier Island Restoration at Ship Island to set up a decision process that could be quickly and effectively implemented during project construction to make decisions should the restored berm incur damages or environmental dynamics change. The four phases are (1) preliminary Camille Cut closure and subaerial berm with medium sand (0.30mm) to 5\u2019 high and 500\u2019 wide; (2) subaerial berm height expansion to 7\u2019 high and 1000\u2019 wide; (3) fine-grained sand (0.21 mm) sediment cap; and (4) nourishment of East Ship southern shoreline with 5.5 MCY of medium-grained sand. There was also a phase 5 dune planting that was not considered in the process. SDM was conducted through a collaborative decision analysis with a diverse team of stakeholders representing multidisciplinary expertise in barrier island ecosystems. Participants represented subject-matter experts, decision makers, and stakeholders who preserve, manage, or restore barrier islands across the Gulf of Mexico region. Specifically, we followed a SDM framework that includes an assessment of Problems, Objectives, Alternatives, Consequences, and Tradeoffs (PrOACT) (Hammond et al 1999; Runge et al 2011) and through a series of webinars and rapid-prototyping workshops used expert judgment to identify and link objectives, performance measures, consequences, trade-offs and uncertainties associated with the construction of the Barrier Island Restoration at Ship Island. This formal process analyzed decisions at key decision points by breaking the problems, potential scenarios and solutions into components that were weighed through a transparent and replicable process. Expert elicitations, predictive models, and quantitative analysis were incorporated into DMs to represent the probabilistic relationships between storm impacts on the constructed island footprint (i.e., breaching, narrowing, and\/or lowering) and consequences for restoration objectives including mitigation of shoaling; wave attenuation; avoiding loss of habitat for sea turtles, shorebirds, and Gulf sturgeon; maintaining salinity levels in Mississippi Sound; and preserving funds for subsequent MsCIP restoration projects. The initial DM was developed at a workshop in November 2013. Results from this workshop were then used in a subsequent series of webinars and workshops through November 2014, to refine the decision questions and consider additional objectives for Ship Island construction and restoration, which were included in a revised decision model. The results of the SDM effort and the decision tool are the product of this iterative process and illustrate the crucial uncertainties affecting the optimal choices for the construction and performance of the MsCIP Barrier Island Restoration Project.","purpose":"Barrier island resource managers within the northern Gulf of Mexico need to more directly incorporate scientific uncertainties and technological challenges inherent with large-scale barrier island restoration projects, and as such, have committed to developing a robust long-term monitoring program and applying adaptive management. These managers want to determine project success in accordance with stated project objectives, and also address critical uncertainties that would inform future decisions on design templates and island performance. They are looking for a process that can help develop adaptive management actions and tools to guide adaptive decision-making within the context of project construction, maintenance, and future prioritization of conservation actions. SDM is a collaborative process that includes stakeholders and scientists to define management objectives, alternative actions, external drivers, predictive models, and quantitative methods for optimization and tradeoff analysis to identify optimal decisions and key uncertainties to be addressed through further gathering of information (Conroy and Peterson 2012 and Gregory et al., 2012). Under the MsCIP program, SDM was applied to the Barrier Island Restoration on Ship Island to provide a formal, transparent and replicable process for analyzing decisions about repairing storm-related damages that may arise during island construction to help support their existing AM program. The original objective of the project was to use SDM for developing a shared conservation framework and vision of comprehensive barrier island restoration planning, implementation, and assessment in the face of climate change within the northern Gulf of Mexico, using the MsCIP Barrier Island Restoration at Ship Island as a case study. A decision tool tied to various future barrier island system conditions associated with estimating sand loss volumes and costs of repair was designed for the MsCIP to ensure management decisions optimize the sustainability of the constructed barrier island project while also accounting for stakeholder input and uncertainty about future system change (i.e. potential storm related damages). This process established a framework to make defensible, transparent, efficient and coordinated decisions to optimize barrier island restoration at Ship Island in the Gulf of Mexico. The developed framework provided a template that could be expanded and carried forward providing opportunities to refine to specific adaptive management needs for other projects and programs in the future.

Decision Model Networks","body":"The goal of barrier island restoration in the northern Gulf of Mexico is to restore barrier island morphology using sediment to support the functions and habitats the islands provide. Barrier island restoration typically involves placement of sediment either directly on the island footprint or within the littoral zone for system transport and distribution. The re-engineering of barrier islands presents numerous challenges and uncertainties associated with climate change induced hurricanes\/storms and other dynamic components of the system such as sediment availability and erosional trends. The goal of this study was to use a collaborative SDM approach to develop two Bayesian decision network models (DMs) for restoration at Ship Island, Mississippi, where sand will be used to close an extensive breach. The team identified what damage may occur during construction, and the DMs guided decisions within the confines of limited sand and money to select actions that minimized adverse impacts to project objectives. DM input was derived from expert elicitation and augmented with inundation data. The first DM determined that sand was more limiting than funds, and unrepaired major breaching would negatively impact project objectives. The second DM addressed if, how, and when to repair more minor damage, depending on the extent it is more cost-effective to repair immediately than risk more damage to the weakened project. SDM was applied to four phases of Barrier Island Restoration at Ship Island to set up a decision process that could be quickly and effectively implemented during project construction to make decisions should the restored berm incur damages or environmental dynamics change. The four phases are (1) preliminary Camille Cut closure and subaerial berm with medium sand (0.30mm) to 5\u2019 high and 500\u2019 wide; (2) subaerial berm height expansion to 7\u2019 high and 1000\u2019 wide; (3) fine-grained sand (0.21 mm) sediment cap; and (4) nourishment of East Ship southern shoreline with 5.5 MCY of medium-grained sand. There was also a phase 5 dune planting that was not considered in the process. SDM was conducted through a collaborative decision analysis with a diverse team of stakeholders representing multidisciplinary expertise in barrier island ecosystems. Participants represented subject-matter experts, decision makers, and stakeholders who preserve, manage, or restore barrier islands across the Gulf of Mexico region. Specifically, we followed a SDM framework that includes an assessment of Problems, Objectives, Alternatives, Consequences, and Tradeoffs (PrOACT) (Hammond et al 1999; Runge et al 2011) and through a series of webinars and rapid-prototyping workshops used expert judgment to identify and link objectives, performance measures, consequences, trade-offs and uncertainties associated with the construction of the Barrier Island Restoration at Ship Island. This formal process analyzed decisions at key decision points by breaking the problems, potential scenarios and solutions into components that were weighed through a transparent and replicable process. Expert elicitations, predictive models, and quantitative analysis were incorporated into DMs to represent the probabilistic relationships between storm impacts on the constructed island footprint (i.e., breaching, narrowing, and\/or lowering) and consequences for restoration objectives including mitigation of shoaling; wave attenuation; avoiding loss of habitat for sea turtles, shorebirds, and Gulf sturgeon; maintaining salinity levels in Mississippi Sound; and preserving funds for subsequent MsCIP restoration projects. The initial DM was developed at a workshop in November 2013. Results from this workshop were then used in a subsequent series of webinars and workshops through November 2014, to refine the decision questions and consider additional objectives for Ship Island construction and restoration, which were included in a revised decision model. The results of the SDM effort and the decision tool are the product of this iterative process and illustrate the crucial uncertainties affecting the optimal choices for the construction and performance of the MsCIP Barrier Island Restoration Project.","purpose":"Barrier island resource managers within the northern Gulf of Mexico need to more directly incorporate scientific uncertainties and technological challenges inherent with large-scale barrier island restoration projects, and as such, have committed to developing a robust long-term monitoring program and applying adaptive management. These managers want to determine project success in accordance with stated project objectives, and also address critical uncertainties that would inform future decisions on design templates and island performance. They are looking for a process that can help develop adaptive management actions and tools to guide adaptive decision-making within the context of project construction, maintenance, and future prioritization of conservation actions. SDM is a collaborative process that includes stakeholders and scientists to define management objectives, alternative actions, external drivers, predictive models, and quantitative methods for optimization and tradeoff analysis to identify optimal decisions and key uncertainties to be addressed through further gathering of information (Conroy and Peterson 2012 and Gregory et al., 2012). Under the MsCIP program, SDM was applied to the Barrier Island Restoration on Ship Island to provide a formal, transparent and replicable process for analyzing decisions about repairing storm-related damages that may arise during island construction to help support their existing AM program. The original objective of the project was to use SDM for developing a shared conservation framework and vision of comprehensive barrier island restoration planning, implementation, and assessment in the face of climate change within the northern Gulf of Mexico, using the MsCIP Barrier Island Restoration at Ship Island as a case study. A decision tool tied to various future barrier island system conditions associated with estimating sand loss volumes and costs of repair was designed for the MsCIP to ensure management decisions optimize the sustainability of the constructed barrier island project while also accounting for stakeholder input and uncertainty about future system change (i.e. potential storm related damages). This process established a framework to make defensible, transparent, efficient and coordinated decisions to optimize barrier island restoration at Ship Island in the Gulf of Mexico. The developed framework provided a template that could be expanded and carried forward providing opportunities to refine to specific adaptive management needs for other projects and programs in the future. During the development of the proposal the original intent was to use the MsCIP as a case study for development of a prototype decision making tool for barrier island restoration and conservation in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Once developed, other regional program managers would be engaged to refine and adapt the draft decision framework to broaden its applicability beyond Mississippi to barrier island restoration and conservation throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico. It was not known however when scoping the project the level of detail that would be necessary to provide a ready to use decision model. After development of the first prototype it was determined by the stakeholder team that it would be more beneficial to the resource community and the MsCIP to add additional detail to the decision tool to create a very detailed ready to use product that could guide decisions related to barrier island construction rather than engage regional program managers in a general framework.","parentId":"57a8b2a1e4b0ebae89baf604","contacts":[{"name":"Gregory Steyer","type":"Point of Contact","contactType":"person","email":"steyerg@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"225-578-7201","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"70803","country":"USA","city":"Baton Rouge","state":"Louisiana","line1":"Livestock Show Office, Parker Coliseum, LSU"}}},{"name":"P.

However, land use change associated with urbanization is having a significant effect on wildlife populations and habitat availability. We sought to understand the effect of global warming on both beneficial and pest insects of trees. We used urban warming as a proxy for global warming as many cities have already warmed as much, due to heat island effects, as they are expected to warm due to climate change by 2050 or even 2100. We were able to develop good predictive models of how warming influences beneficial and pest insects for cities in the Southeast and across the east coast more generally. We were also able to predict how tree health will respond to these changes in insect communities. In addition, by comparing our results to those we garnered from herbarium specimens (many insects can be found on herbarium specimens) we could show that the effects of urban warming match those of climate change through time. In short, a subset of pests is likely to get far worse with warming and this effect is likely to be most pronounced in the Southeast.

One such interaction that may be altered under climate change is the ant-plant seed dispersal mutualism common in deciduous forests of eastern North America. As climatic warming alters the abundance and activity levels of ants, the potential exists for shifts in rates of ant-mediated seed dispersal. We used an experimental temperature manipulation at two sites in the eastern US (Harvard Forest in Massachusetts and Duke Forest in North Carolina) to examine the potential impacts of climatic warming on overall rates of seed dispersal (using&nbsp; \n<em>Asarum canadense<\/em>seeds) as well as species-specific rates of seed dispersal at the Duke Forest site. We also examined the relationship between ant critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and the mean seed removal temperature for each ant species. We found that seed removal rates did not change as a result of experimental warming at either study site, nor were there any changes in species-specific rates of seed dispersal. There was, however, a positive relationship between CTmax&nbsp;and mean seed removal temperature, whereby species with higher CTmax&nbsp;removed more seeds at hotter temperatures. The temperature at which seeds were removed was influenced by experimental warming as well as diurnal and day-to-day fluctuations in temperature. Taken together, our results suggest that while temperature may play a role in regulating seed removal by ants, ant plant seed-dispersal mutualisms may be more robust to climate change than currently assumed.","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","contacts":[{"name":"Katharine L Stuble","type":"Author","organization":{"displayText":"University of Tennessee"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Courtney M Patterson","type":"Author","organization":{"displayText":"University of Tennessee"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Mariano A Rodriguez-Cabal","type":"Author","organization":{"displayText":"Universidad Nacional del Comahue"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Relena R Ribbons","type":"Author","organization":{"displayText":"University of Tennessee"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Robert R Dunn","type":"Author","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Nathan J Sanders","type":"Author","organization":{"displayText":"University of Tennessee"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/286\/","title":"Stuble et al. 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Ecology"},{"name":"Ants"},{"name":"Climate change"},{"name":"Myrmecochory"},{"name":"Seed dispersal"},{"name":"Warming"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-03-11","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-10-03T11:32:35.729-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-19T11:20:24.974-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2014","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-10-03T11:32:35.729-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-19T11:20:24.974-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"PeerJ","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.7717\/peerj.286"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"volume","value":"2"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"startPage","value":"e286"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issn","value":"2167-8359"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","people":["Katharine L Stuble","Courtney M Patterson","Mariano A Rodriguez-Cabal","Relena R Ribbons","Robert R Dunn","Nathan J Sanders"],"orgs":["Southeast CSC"],"children":[]},"546cf37ae4b0fc7976bf1d52":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/526ebc60e4b044919baf138e","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Early pest development and loss of biological control are associated with urban warming","relatedTitle":"Tree Eaters: Predicting the Response of Herbivores to the Integrated Effects of Urban and Global Change","id":"546cf37ae4b0fc7976bf1d52","relatedId":"526ebc60e4b044919baf138e","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/546cf37ae4b0fc7976bf1d52","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Tree Eaters: Predicting the Response of Herbivores to the Integrated Effects of Urban and Global Change","relatedTitle":"Early pest development and loss of biological control are associated with urban warming","id":"526ebc60e4b044919baf138e","relatedId":"546cf37ae4b0fc7976bf1d52","annotation":null}]},"id":"546cf37ae4b0fc7976bf1d52","title":"Early pest development and loss of biological control are associated with urban warming","body":"Abstract (from http:\/\/rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/10\/11\/20140586?rss=1):&nbsp;Climate warming is predicted to cause many changes in ectotherm communities, one of which is phenological mismatch, wherein one species' development advances relative to an associated species or community. Phenological mismatches already lead to loss of pollination services, and we predict that they also cause loss of biological control. Here, we provide evidence that a pest develops earlier due to urban warming but that phenology of its parasitoid community does not similarly advance.

We sought to understand the effect of global warming on both beneficial and pest insects of trees. We used urban warming as a proxy for global warming as many cities have already warmed as much, due to heat island effects, as they are expected to warm due to climate change by 2050 or even 2100. We were able to develop good predictive models of how warming influences beneficial and pest insects for cities in the Southeast and across the east coast more generally. We were also able to predict how tree health will respond to these changes in insect communities. In addition, by comparing our results to those we garnered from herbarium specimens (many insects can be found on herbarium specimens) we could show that the effects of urban warming match those of climate change through time. In short, a subset of pests is likely to get far worse with warming and this effect is likely to be most pronounced in the southeast. A second body of work built on these discoveries to consider how to protect trees and forests from the pests that do better with warming. Work continues to be focused on the importance of which trees are present (or planted) and the diversity of those trees.<\/p>","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","contacts":[{"name":"Robb

services to city residents, but their management is hindered by a poor understanding of their ecology. We examined a novel ecosystem service relevant to urban public health and esthetics: the consumption of littered food waste by arthropods. Theory and data from natural systems suggest that the magnitude and resilience of this service should increase with biological diversity. We measured food removal by presenting known quantities of cookies, potato chips, and hot dogs in street medians (24 sites) and parks (21 sites) in New York City, USA. At the same sites, we assessed ground-arthropod diversity and abiotic conditions, including history of flooding during Hurricane Sandy 7 months prior to the study. Arthropod diversity was greater in parks (on average 11 hexapod families and 4.7 ant species per site), than in medians (nine hexapod families and 2.7 ant species per site). However, counter to our diversity-based prediction, arthropods in medians removed 2-3 times more food per day than did those in parks. We detected no effect of flooding (at 19 sites) on this service. Instead, greater food removal was associated with the presence of the introduced pavement ant (Tetramorium sp. E) and with hotter, drier conditions that may have increased arthropod metabolism. When vertebrates also had access to food, more was removed, indicating that arthropods and vertebrates compete for littered food. We estimate that arthropods alone could remove 4-6.5 kg of food per year in a single street median, reducing its availability to less desirable fauna such as rats. Our results suggest that species identity and habitat may be more relevant than diversity for predicting urban ecosystem services. Even small green spaces such as street medians provide ecosystem services that may complement those of larger habitat patches across the urban landscape.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> \n<strong>This publication was developed as a part of the project,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/display-project\/4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c\/526ebc60e4b044919baf138e\">Tree Eaters: Predicting the Response of Herbivores to the Integrated Effects of Urban and Global Change<\/a>.<\/strong>\n<br \/> \n<br \/> Read the North Carolina State University's press release on this publication \n<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/news.ncsu.edu\/2014\/12\/youngsteadt-eat-nyc\/\">here<\/a><\/strong>.&nbsp;","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","linkParentIds":["5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3"],"contacts":[{"name":"Elsa Youngsteadt","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Ryanna C.

However, most studies of biodiversity in cities are conducted on a short time scale, usually less than 3&nbsp;years, and so miss the long-term dynamics of communities inhabiting these ecosystems. Here we use a study performed in the early 70\u2019s on North Carolina State University (Raleigh, USA) as a baseline to evaluate the long term effects of disturbance and introduced species on native ant communities. Ant species were sampled almost 40&nbsp;years later using a variety of sampling techniques in order to maximize species collection. Our results show that while the number of exotic species increased, including three major invasive ants, native ant species richness remained high. Furthermore, our survey was able to add several new records for the area considered, in comparison of the 70\u2019s study, for a total of 89 species known from NCSU campus. After comparison with other studies, our results represent one of the most species-rich urban environments monitored and thus open encouraging perspective on how urban ecosystems could contribute to the preservation of the biodiversity of small-bodies organisms such as ants.","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","contacts":[{"name":"Benoit Gu\u00e9nard","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Adrianna Cardinal-De Casas","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Robert R.

Less studied are the effects of increases in temperature on species interactions. While warming may potentially disrupt interactions among species, species interactions may also mediate individual species responses to ongoing climatic change. In this experiment we manipulated temperature in field-based, open-top chambers for three years to examine the relationship between biotic interactions and climatic warming on the population dynamics of seedlings of Quercus alba. We investigated the effect of warming on rates of insect herbivory on Q. alba seedlings. Additionally, we assessed the relative effects of increasing temperature, insect herbivory, and conspecific density on seedling survival. We found two unexpected results. First, we observed a negative relationship between temperature and levels of insect herbivory during each year of the experiment. Second, higher levels of herbivory were associated with higher rates of survival to the second year of the study. Although we never detected a direct effect of conspecific density on seedling survival, herbivory and conspecific seedling density did interact to influence Q. alba seedling survival early in the experiment. Taken together, our results indicate species responses to climatic warming may be contingent on intra- and interspecific interactions, sometimes in complicated and counter-intuitive ways.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> This thesis was developed as a part of the project,&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/display-project\/4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c\/526ebc60e4b044919baf138e\">Tree Eaters: Predicting the Response of Herbivores to the Integrated Effects of Urban and Global Change<\/a>.&nbsp;","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","contacts":[{"name":"Melissa A.

However, changes in microbial community structure and function at the southern site did not result in changes in cellulose decomposition rates. While most global change models rest on the assumption that taxa will respond similarly to warming across sites and their ranges, these results suggest that the responses of microorganisms to warming may be mediated by differences across the geographic boundaries of ecosystems.\n<\/div>","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","contacts":[{"name":"PeerJ Inc.","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Melissa A.

For ectothermic animals, there is systematic latitudinal variation in the relationship between climate and thermal performance curves, which describe the relationship between temperature and an organism's fitness. Here, we ask whether these documented latitudinal patterns can be generalized to predict arthropod responses to warming across mid- and high temperate latitudes, for taxa whose thermal physiology has not been measured. To address this question, we used a novel natural experiment consisting of a series of urban warming gradients at different latitudes. Specifically, we sampled arthropods from a single common street tree species across temperature gradients in four US cities, located from 35.8 to 42.4\u00b0 latitude. We captured 6746 arthropods in 34 families from 111 sites that varied in summer average temperature by 1.7\u20133.4&nbsp;\u00b0C within each city. Arthropod responses to warming within each city were characterized as Poisson regression coefficients describing change in abundance per \u00b0C for each family. Family responses in the two midlatitude cities were heterogeneous, including significantly negative and positive effects, while those in high-latitude cities varied no more than expected by chance within each city. We expected high-latitude taxa to increase in abundance with warming, and they did so in one of the two high-latitude cities; in the other, Queens (New York City), most taxa declined with warming, perhaps due to habitat loss that was correlated with warming in this city. With the exception of Queens, patterns of family responses to warming were consistent with predictions based on known latitudinal patterns in arthropod physiology relative to regional climate. Heterogeneous responses in midlatitudes may be ecologically disruptive if interacting taxa respond oppositely to warming.","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","linkParentIds":["5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3","55fb1b80e4b05d6c4e501c10"],"contacts":[{"name":"Elsa Youngsteadt","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Andrew F.

This is driven by human food inputs, but the consequence of these resources for urban animal populations is poorly understood. We investigated the role of human foods in ant diets across an urbanization gradient in Manhattan using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. We found that some\u2014but not all\u2014ant species living in Manhattan's most urbanized habitats had \u03b413C signatures associated with processed human foods. In particular, pavement ants ( \n<em>Tetramorium<\/em>&nbsp;sp. E) had increased levels of \u03b413C similar to \u03b413C levels in human fast foods.

This pattern persisted across the broader ant community; species in traffic islands used human resources more than park species.

We measured the effect of experimental warming of 0.6\u20135.0&nbsp;&deg;C on the phenology of a diverse suite of 11 plant species in the deciduous forest understory (Duke Forest, North Carolina, USA) in a relatively warm year (2011) and a colder year (2013). Our primary goal was to dissect how temperature affects timing of spring budburst, flowering, and autumn leaf coloring for functional groups with different growth habits, phenological niches, and xylem anatomy. Warming advanced budburst of six deciduous woody species by 5\u201315&nbsp;days and delayed leaf coloring by 18\u201321&nbsp;days, resulting in an extension of the growing season by as much as 20\u201329&nbsp;days. Spring temperature accumulation was strongly correlated with budburst date, but temperature alone cannot explain the diverse budburst responses observed among plant functional types. Ring-porous trees showed a consistent temperature response pattern across years, suggesting these species are sensitive to photoperiod. Conversely, diffuse-porous species responded differently between years, suggesting winter chilling may be more important in regulating budburst. Budburst of the ring-porous&nbsp; \n<em>Quercus alba<\/em>&nbsp;responded nonlinearly to warming, suggesting evolutionary constraints may limit changes in phenology, and therefore productivity, in the future. Warming caused a divergence in flowering times among species in the forest community, resulting in a longer flowering season by 10-16&nbsp;days. Temperature was a good predictor of flowering for only four of the seven species studied here. Observations of interannual temperature variability overpredicted flowering responses in spring-blooming species, relative to our warming experiment, and did not consistently predict even the direction of flowering shifts. Experiments that push temperatures beyond historic variation are indispensable for improving predictions of future changes in phenology.","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","contacts":[{"name":"Ren\u00e9e M.

Unfortunately, urban trees often have more herbivorous insect pests than rural trees but the mechanisms and consequences of these infestations are not well documented. Here, we examine how temperature affects the abundance of a scale insect, \n<em>Melanaspis tenebricosa<\/em> (Comstock) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), on one of the most commonly planted street trees in the eastern U.S. Next, we examine how both pest abundance and temperature are associated with water stress, growth, and condition of 26 urban street trees. Although trees in the warmest urban sites grew the most, they were more water stressed and in worse condition than trees in cooler sites. Our analyses indicate that visible declines in tree condition were best explained by scale-insect infestation rather than temperature. To test the broader relevance of these results, we extend our analysis to a database of more than 2700 Raleigh, US street trees. Plotting these trees on a Landsat thermal image of Raleigh, we found that warmer sites had over 70% more trees in poor condition than those in cooler sites. Our results support previous studies linking warmer urban habitats to greater pest abundance and extend this association to show its effect on street tree condition. Our results suggest that street tree condition and ecosystem services may decline as urban expansion and global warming exacerbate the urban heat island effect. Although our non-probability sampling method limits our scope of inference, our results present a gloomy outlook for urban forests and emphasize the need for management tools. Existing urban tree inventories and thermal maps could be used to identify species that would be most suitable for urban conditions.","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","contacts":[{"name":"Public Library of Science","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Adam G.

Urban sprawl strongly impacts the urban ecosystems it creates and the natural and agro-ecosystems that it displaces and fragments. Here, we project urban sprawl changes for the next 50 years for the fast-growing Southeast U.S. Previous studies have focused on modeling population density, but the urban extent is arguably as important as population density per se in terms of its ecological and conservation impacts. We develop simulations using the SLEUTH urban growth model that complement population-driven models but focus on spatial pattern and extent. To better capture the reach of low-density suburban development, we extend the capabilities of SLEUTH by incorporating street-network information. Our simulations point to a future in which the extent of urbanization in the Southeast is projected to increase by 101% to 192%. Our results highlight areas where ecosystem fragmentation is likely, and serve as a benchmark to explore the challenging tradeoffs between ecosystem health, economic growth and cultural desires.","parentId":"55159243e4b032384278178b","linkParentIds":["4ffae449e4b0c15d5ce9fadf","54c689cee4b043905e019ad5","526ebc6de4b044919baf1393"],"contacts":[{"name":"Adam J.

Herbivorous arthropod pests are often more abundant in urban than in rural areas, and urban outbreaks have been attributed to reduced control by predators and parasitoids and to increased susceptibility of stressed urban plants. These hypotheses, however, leave many outbreaks unexplained and fail to predict variation in pest abundance within cities. Here we show that the abundance of a common insect pest is positively related to temperature even when controlling for other habitat characteristics. The scale insect&nbsp; \n<em>Parthenolecanium quercifex<\/em>&nbsp;was 13 times more abundant on willow oak trees in the hottest parts of Raleigh, NC, in the southeastern United States, than in cooler areas, though parasitism rates were similar. We further separated the effects of heat from those of natural enemies and plant quality in a greenhouse reciprocal transplant experiment.&nbsp; \n<em>P. quercifex<\/em>&nbsp;collected from hot urban trees became more abundant in hot greenhouses than in cool greenhouses, whereas the abundance of&nbsp; \n<em>P. quercifex<\/em>&nbsp;collected from cooler urban trees remained low in hot and cool greenhouses.&nbsp; \n<em>Parthenolecanium quercifex<\/em>living in urban hot spots succeed with warming, and they do so because some demes have either acclimatized or adapted to high temperatures. Our results provide the first evidence that heat can be a key driver of insect pest outbreaks on urban trees. Since urban warming is similar in magnitude to global warming predicted in the next 50 years, pest abundance on city trees may foreshadow widespread outbreaks as natural forests also grow warmer.","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","contacts":[{"name":"E.

Using a unique, citywide, factorial experiment, we investigated how warming and insect herbivory affected physiological function and carbon sequestration (carbon stored per year) of mature trees. Urban warming increased herbivorous arthropod abundance on trees, but these herbivores had negligible effects on tree carbon sequestration. Instead, urban warming was associated with an estimated 12% loss of carbon sequestration, in part because photosynthesis was reduced at hotter sites. Ecosystem service assessments that do not consider urban conditions may overestimate urban tree carbon storage. Because urban and global warming are becoming more intense, our results suggest that urban trees will sequester even less carbon in the future.","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","linkParentIds":["55fb1b80e4b05d6c4e501c10","5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3"],"contacts":[{"name":"The Royal Society","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Emily Meineke","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Elsa Youngsteadt","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Robert R.

Unfortunately, herbivorous arthropod pests are often more abundant on urban than rural trees, reducing tree growth, survival, and ecosystem services. Previous research where vegetation complexity was reduced has attributed elevated urban pest abundance to decreased regulation by natural enemies. However, reducing vegetation complexity, particularly the density of overstory trees, also makes cities hotter than natural habitats. We ask how urban habitat characteristics influence an abiotic factor, temperature, and a biotic factor, natural enemy abundance, in regulating the abundance of an urban forest pest, the gloomy scale, (Melanaspis tenebricosa). We used a map of surface temperature to select red maple trees (Acer rubrum) at warmer and cooler sites in Raleigh, NC. We quantified habitat complexity by measuring impervious surface cover, local vegetation structural complexity, and landscape scale vegetation cover around each tree. Using path analysis, we determined that impervious surface (the most important habitat variable) increased scale insect abundance by increasing tree canopy temperature, rather than by reducing natural enemy abundance or percent parasitism. As a mechanism for this response, we found that increasing temperature significantly increases scale insect fecundity and contributes to greater population increase. Specifically, adult female M. tenebricosa egg sets increased by approximately fourteen eggs for every 1&deg; C increase in temperature. Climate change models predict that the global climate will increase by 2-3&deg; C in the next 50-100 years, which we found would increase scale insect abundance by three orders of magnitude. This result supports predictions that urban and natural forests will face greater herbivory in the future, and suggests that a primary cause could be direct, positive effects of warming on herbivore fitness rather than altered trophic interactions.\n <\/div> \n<\/div>","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","contacts":[{"name":"Adam Garland Dale","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Steven D.

Here we ask how urbanization affects the immune response and pathogen load of feral and managed colonies of honey bees ( \n<em>Apis mellifera<\/em>&nbsp;Linnaeus), the predominant economically important pollinator worldwide. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we measured expression of 4 immune genes and relative abundance of 10 honey bee pathogens. We also measured worker survival in a laboratory bioassay. We found that pathogen pressure on honey bees increased with urbanization and management, and the probability of worker survival declined 3-fold along our urbanization gradient. The effect of management on pathogens appears to be mediated by immunity, with feral bees expressing immune genes at nearly twice the levels of managed bees following an immune challenge. The effect of urbanization, however, was not linked with immunity; instead, urbanization may favor viability and transmission of some disease agents. Feral colonies, with lower disease burdens and stronger immune responses, may illuminate ways to improve honey bee management. The previously unexamined effects of urbanization on honey-bee disease are concerning, suggesting that urban areas may favor problematic diseases of pollinators.","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","linkParentIds":["5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3"],"contacts":[{"name":"Elsa Youngsteadt","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"R.

Sea-level rise and the changing frequency of extreme events associated with climate change are now further degrading the capacity of those ecological and social systems to remain resilient. As custodians of ecological goods and services valued by society, coastal National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) have an especially important role to play in helping socio-ecological systems adapt to global-change processes.&nbsp;To help refuges address this challenge, we articulated a two-track decision problem faced by coastal refuge managers. The first track focuses on efficient allocation of limited staff time and budgets for management of existing programs under the current refuge design. The second track recognizes the negative impacts of global-change processes on the ability to maintain societal values derived from the existing refuge configuration. Over the long term, refuge managers must decide when and where to acquire or protect new land or&nbsp;habitat to supplement or replace the existing refuge footprint, to sustain values as the system evolves over time. Each track suggests a unique set of alternatives to represent differences in the identity of the decision maker(s) and in the spatial, temporal, and governance scales of the decision problem. We developed a prototype decision structure by describing how a hierarchical set of objectives and alternative actions can be used to explore the tradeoffs inherent in making short and long-term adaptation decisions. The prototype attempts to characterize a balance between decisions within the purview of the refuge itself and decisions made at higher organizational levels concerning reconfiguration of the refuge, which may be required to ensure the long-term persistence of societal values.<br> <br> <strong>This project is jointly supported by the Northeast Climate Science Center and the Southeast Climate Science Center.&nbsp;<\/strong><br> &nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"526eaacce4b044919baee8fd","linkParentIds":["52604642e4b04eaeeb44eda8"],"contacts":[{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","active":true,"aliases":["Northeast CSC","NECSC"],"fbmsCodes":["GGHCEN0507"],"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"Northeast Climate Science Center - Location","mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","active":true,"aliases":["SECSC","Southeast CSC","NCCWSC SE (CSC)"],"fbmsCodes":["GGHCEN0502","GGHCGR0502"],"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"Southeast Climate Science Center - Location","mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Elizabeth Pienaar","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Florida"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Nathan J Wood","oldPartyId":11427,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"nwood@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Geographer","firstName":"Nathan","middleName":"J","lastName":"Wood","cellPhone":"3609916235","organization":{"displayText":"Western Geographic Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"5032513470","officePhone":"5032513291","streetAddress":{"zip":"97201","city":"Portland","state":"OR","line1":"2130 S.W.

Management Decisions in the Face of Sea-Level Rise Along the U.S. Atlantic Coast","body":"Coastal ecosystems in the Eastern U.S. have been severely altered by processes associated with human development, including drainage of wetlands, changes in hydrology, land clearing, agricultural and forestry activity, and the construction of structures that \u201charden\u201d the coast. Sea-level rise and the changing frequency of extreme events associated with climate change are now further degrading the capacity of those ecological and social systems to remain resilient. As custodians of ecological goods and services valued by society, coastal National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) have a particularly important role to play in helping socio-ecological systems adapt to global-change processes. To help refuges address this challenge, we articulated a two-track decision problem faced by coastal refuge managers. The first track focuses on efficient allocation of limited staff time and budgets for management of existing programs under the current refuge design. The second track recognizes the negative impacts of global-change processes on the ability to maintain societal values derived from the existing refuge configuration. Over the long term, refuge managers must decide when and where to acquire or protect new land\/habitat to supplement or replace the existing refuge footprint to sustain values as the system evolves over time.

Spartina alterniflora Loisel (Poaceae) is a foundation species that builds and maintains salt marshes. Despite this species' importance, much of its basic reproductive biology is not well understood, including flowering phenology, seed production, and the effects of flowering on growth and biomass allocation. We sought to better understand these life history traits and use that knowledge to consider how this species may be affected by climate change.&nbsp;\n<br \/> \n<br \/> Methods: We examined temporal and spatial patterns in flowering and seed production in S. alterniflora at a latitudinal scale (along the U.S. Atlantic coast), regional scale (within New England), and local scale (among subhabitats within marshes) and determined the impact of flowering on growth allocation using field and greenhouse studies.&nbsp;\n<br \/> \n<br \/> Key results: Flowering stem density did not vary along a latitudinal gradient, while at the local scale plants in the less submerged panne subhabitats produced fewer flowers and seeds than those in more frequently submerged subhabitats. We also found that a shift in biomass allocation from above to belowground was temporally related to flowering phenology.&nbsp;\n<br \/> \n<br \/> Conclusions: We expect that environmental change will affect seed production and that the phenological relationship with flowering will result in limitations to belowground production and thus affect marsh elevation gain. Salt marshes provide an excellent model system for exploring the interactions between plant ecology and ecosystem functioning, enabling better predictions of climate change impacts.","parentId":"52fa37fbe4b02baefb049cea","contacts":[{"name":"Sarah C.

Coastal refuges are already experiencing threats from sea-level rise and other change processes that are largely beyond their ability to influence, while at the same time facing tighter budgets and reduced staff. We engaged in workshops with NWR managers along the U.S. Atlantic coast to understand the problems they face from global-change processes and began a multidisciplinary collaboration to use decision science to help address them. We are applying a values-focused approach to base management decisions on the resource objectives of land managers, as well as those of stakeholders who may benefit from the goods and services produced by a refuge. Two insights that emerged from our workshops were a conspicuous mismatch between the scale at which management can influence outcomes and the scale of environmental processes, and the need to consider objectives related to ecosystem goods and services that traditionally have not been explicitly considered by refuges (e.g., protection from storm surge). The broadening of objectives complicates the decision-making process, but also provides opportunities for collaboration with stakeholders who may have agendas different from those of the refuge, as well as an opportunity for addressing problems across scales. From a practical perspective, we recognized the need to (1) efficiently allocate limited staff time and budgets for short-term management of existing programs and resources under the current refuge design and (2) develop long-term priorities for acquiring or protecting new land\/habitat to supplement or replace the existing refuge footprint and thus sustain refuge values as the system evolves over time. Structuring the decision-making problem in this manner facilitated a better understanding of the issues of scale and suggested that a long-term solution will require a significant reassessment of objectives to better reflect the comprehensive values of refuges to society. We discuss some future considerations to integrate these two problems into a single framework by developing novel optimization approaches for dynamic problems that account for uncertainty in future conditions.","parentId":"52fa37fbe4b02baefb049cea","contacts":[{"name":"Fred A Johnson","oldPartyId":5122,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"fjohnson@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Wildlife Biologist","firstName":"Fred","middleName":"A","lastName":"Johnson","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Southeast Ecological Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"3522643488","streetAddress":{"zip":"32653","city":"Gainesville","state":"FL","line1":"7920 NW 71St Street"},"buildingCode":"BAC","name":"Fred A Johnson\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"32653","country":"USA","city":"Gainesville","state":"FL","line1":"7920 NW 71st Street"},"building":"SESC - GVL - Main R and D Building"}},{"name":"Mitchell Eaton","oldPartyId":13324,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"meaton@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Mitchell","lastName":"Eaton","cellPhone":"9194412588","organization":{"displayText":"Southeast Climate Science Center","directoryId":"59608"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"9195158640","streetAddress":{"zip":"27695-7617","city":"Raleigh","state":"NC","line1":"David Clark Labs, NC State Univ"},"buildingCode":"AVD","name":"Mitchell Eaton\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"14853-3001","country":"USA","city":"Ithaca","state":"NY","line1":"Cornell University, Fernow Hall, Room 206F"},"building":"Bldg Record"}},{"name":"Gerard McMahon","oldPartyId":6800,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"gmcmahon@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Center Director, Southeast Climate Science Center","firstName":"Gerard","lastName":"McMahon","cellPhone":"9196042572","organization":{"displayText":"Southeast Climate Science Center","directoryId":"59608"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9195155327","officePhone":"9195152229","streetAddress":{"zip":"27695-7617","city":"Raleigh","state":"NC","line1":"David Clark Labs, NC State Univ"},"buildingCode":"AVD","name":"Gerard McMahon\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"27695-7617","country":"USA","city":"Raleigh","state":"NC","line1":"NC Coop F&W Res Unit, NC St Univ, Dept of Zoology, Campus Box 7617"},"building":"Bldg Record"}},{"name":"Raye Nilius","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Michael R.

As custodians of ecological goods and services valued by society, coastal National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) have an especially important role to play in helping socio-ecological systems adapt to global-change processes.&nbsp;To help refuges address this challenge, we articulated a two-track decision problem faced by coastal refuge managers.

The second track recognizes the negative impacts of global-change processes on the ability to maintain societal values derived from the existing refuge configuration.

Analysis and Science Communication","body":"<div>The purpose of this grant is to provide research opportunities to students and staff working with the Southeast Climate Science Center (SE CSC) with a focus on decision analysis and science communication. Research activities will occur primarily within the framework of existing SE CSC-funded projects. Student research will support project activities associated with the development and use of science-based information to make climate adaptation management decisions. Student abilities to participate in these research activities will be enhanced by participation in a course entitled \u201cIntroduction to Structured Decision Making\u201d taught at the National Conservation Training Center (NCTC) in Shepherdstown, WV. In addition to participation on a team of researchers conducting \u201cactionable science\u201d, additional research opportunities will be identified in consultation with North Carolina State University (NCSU) and SE CSC scientists and other researchers within the Department of the Interior. These opportunities could include travel to and participation in research team activities associated with SE CSC research projects. Although the majority of this support is designed for students working with SE CSC research projects, it is expected that some travel will also be needed for NCSU scientists facilitating student research.&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<\/div>\n","parentId":"544a8ec4e4b03653c63f898a","contacts":[{"name":"Ryan Boyles","oldPartyId":64939,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"ryan_boyles@ncsu.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Boyles","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Damian Shea","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Label","name":"decision analysis"},{"type":"Label","name":"science communication"},{"type":"Label","name":"Structured Decision Making"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Southeast CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-10","label":"Start Date"},"1":{"type":"End","dateString":"2017-09","label":"End Date"},"2":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-10-24T11:42:08.244-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"3":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-30T08:01:09.231-07:00","label":"Last Updated"},"start":"2014","end":"2017","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-10-24T11:42:08.244-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-30T08:01:09.231-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"FY 14 Grant ($33,512)","value":"G14AP00077"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":33512,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2014","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":33512}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":910,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":217905,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2016-04-11T20:39:21.000Z","name":"SE-2014-1_Smokies_AlanCressler.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__27\/02\/7f\/27027f221577e65a85958b533a4039e5dfb74725","title":"Great Smoky Mountain National Park -

Estimates of extinction rates and population losses attributable to climatic change are often based on studies of modeled biogeographic distributions, which rely on simple relationships between present-day distributions of species and climate variables to estimate distributions of species under future climate. Hundreds of papers using distribution models - based almost exclusively on relationships between plants and climate - have been published. The predictions of these models undergird conservation plans, are used to forecast the magnitude of future extinctions, and to leverage efforts to produce policies aimed at mitigating the effects of climatic change. Remarkably few experimental manipulations of the effects of climatic change, and in particular temperature change, have been conducted on animal populations and communities or on ecological processes dependent on their dynamics. This project builds upon the longest-running, largest scale forest warming experiment in the world to synthetically consider the effects of warming on diverse taxonomic and functional groups, from fungi and bacteria to herbivores and plant pathogens. The results represent the most ambitious attempt to understand how entire biotas change in response to warming conducted anywhere in the world to date.<\/div>\n","parentId":"544a8ec4e4b03653c63f898a","contacts":[{"name":"Robert Dunn","type":"Principal

Future changes in climate, specifically changes in tempeature, and the type, timing, and distribution of precipitation may lead to changes in the hydrologic cycle. As such, natural resource managers are in need of tools that can provide estimates of key components of the hydrologic cycle, uncertainty associated with the estimates, and limitations associated with the climate data used to estimate these components. To help address this need, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Monthly Water Balance Model Hydrology Futures Portal (<a href=\"https:\/\/my.usgs.gov\/mows\/\">https:\/\/my.usgs.gov\/mows\/<\/a>) is a user friendly interface that summarizes meteorological and hydrologic variables for historical and simulated future conditions across the continental United States (CONUS).<\/p>\n\n<p>The portal is the end product of several related products that work together to bring information to the user. Climate data were summarized for hydrologic response units (HRUs), which are land surface units that contribute runoff to the stream network and are used to simulate hydrologic processes across the CONUS with the monthly water balance model (MWBM). MWBM input and output variables were organized into the Hydrology Futures Database. A Web Feature Service (WFS) was built on top of the hydrographic features. The portal was then constructed on top of the WFS to take user-specified data request (such as geographic location, period of record, and variable of interest), retrieve the specified data from the Hydrology Futures database, and generate graphs and summary reports back to the user. The portal provides summaries for seven different hydrologic and meteorologic variables (actual evapotranspiration, atmospheric temperature, potential evapotranspiration, precipitation, runoff, snow water equivalent, and streamflow).<\/p>\n","parentId":"57c074a8e4b0f2f0ceb88f04","webLinks":[{"type":"webapp","typeLabel":"Web Application","uri":"https:\/\/my.usgs.gov\/mows\/","rel":"related","title":"MOWS Hydrologic Modeling for Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks LCC","hidden":false}],"tags":[{"name":"Hydrology"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2017","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2017-01-13T11:36:54.686-07:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2017-01-13T11:43:38.047-07:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2017","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2017-01-13T11:36:54.686-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2017-01-13T11:43:38.047-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","children":[]}}},"57c074c0e4b0f2f0ceb88f09":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"57c074c0e4b0f2f0ceb88f09","title":"Other (Approved for Public)","parentId":"57c07274e4b0f2f0ceb88ef6","systemTypes":["Folder"],"dates":{"0":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-08-26T10:56:32.528-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"1":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-08-26T10:56:32.528-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-08-26T10:56:32.528-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-08-26T10:56:32.528-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","children":[]}}}}},"55130c81e4b02e76d75c075b":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"55130c81e4b02e76d75c075b","title":"FY 2015 Projects","parentId":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","systemTypes":["Folder"],"dates":{"0":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-03-25T13:29:05.032-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"1":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-26T04:44:43.571-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-03-25T13:29:05.032-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-26T04:44:43.571-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=55130c81e4b02e76d75c075b&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=55130c81e4b02e76d75c075b&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=55130c81e4b02e76d75c075b&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=55130c81e4b02e76d75c075b","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/55130c81e4b02e76d75c075b\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""}],"csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","children":{"553fddf0e4b0a658d7938ef5":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"553fddf0e4b0a658d7938ef5","title":"Climate Change Adaptation for Coastal National Wildlife Refuges","body":"<div>Coastal ecosystems in the eastern U.S. have been severely altered by processes associated with human development, sea-level rise and the increased frequency of extreme events related to climate change. These influences are degrading the capacity of both ecological and human social systems to remain resilient in the face of global change. National Wildlife Refuges along the east coast protect critical habitat and ecosystems for a host of wildlife species, but also contribute to essential goods and services that benefit coastal communities, businesses and individuals. Storm-surge protection, increased water quality, nurseries for commercially important fin and shellfish, and recreational opportunities are only some of the benefits to society contributed by coastal wildlife refuges. Faced with sea-level rise and climate change, the role of coastal refuges to protect our nation\u2019s natural resources and provide ecosystem services is in jeopardy. The U.S. Geological Survey is proposing a management-research collaboration with coastal refuges to assist in planning for and adapting to sea-level rise and other global change processes. This collaboration will integrate the expertise of specialists in global-change science, coastal dynamics, resource economics and decision science to address management policies that will benefit both human and wildlife interests into the future.<\/div>\n","parentId":"55130c81e4b02e76d75c075b","contacts":[{"name":"Mitchell Eaton","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"meaton@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Southeast Climate Science Center","directoryId":"59608"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"9195158640","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"27695","country":"USA","city":"Raleigh","state":"NC","line1":"127H David Clark Labs\r\nNC State University"}}},{"name":"Fred Johnson","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"fjohnson@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Southeast Ecological Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"3522643488","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"32653","country":"USA","city":"Gainesville","state":"FL","line1":"7920 NW 71st Street"}}},{"name":"Julien Martin","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"julienmartin@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Southeast Ecological Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"3522643502","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"32653","country":"null","city":"Gainesville","state":"FL","line1":"7920 NW 71st Street"}}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jennifer Costanza","oldPartyId":23622,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jennifer_costanza@ncsu.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Costanza","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Laura Taylor","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Sarah Dawsey","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Cape Romain NWR"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Mike Bryant","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina Coastal Plain Refuge Complex"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pamala Wingrove","oldPartyId":64982,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"pamala_wingrove@fws.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Natural Resource Planner","firstName":"Pamala","lastName":"Wingrove","cellPhone":"4402410606","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina Coastal Plain Refuge Complex"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"2524734836","officePhone":"2524731131246","streetAddress":{"zip":"27954","country":"US","city":"Manteo","state":"NC","line1":"708 N.

Coastal NWRs have an especially important role to play in helping socio-ecological systems adapt to sea-level rise and climate change that are being exacerbated by human modifications of coastal systems. Due to the complex nature of these issues and the potential ecological and socio-economic impacts of public-land decisions, it is imperative that scarce conservation resources be used as efficiently as possible as refuges struggle to accomplish their mission. Without identifying additional management options, however, global change processes may constrain the ability of refuges, in their existing configuration, to meet this mission.  Careful resource planning and allocation decisions in the next several years, made collaboratively with partners having both overlapping and possibly competing interests, may provide coastal refuges a unique opportunity to contribute to a broader societal adaptation to global change processes.\r\n\r\nWe have begun working with NWR personnel from four Atlantic coastal refuges to elicit management concerns regarding near- and long-term resource issues, identify key partners without whom adaptation policies are likely to fail, and characterize broad classes of adaptation strategies available for consideration.  To help NWRs develop strategies to address natural resource management in the face of dynamic system change, we will apply methods and tools from decision science. This approach includes integrating management objectives, potential management actions, and relevant system models to predict the outcomes of actions on the system and identify optimal decisions with respect to the objectives. If required, a monitoring program is tailored to keep track of the state of the system and evaluate progress. Although the uncertainties of predicting outcomes from non-stationary processes poses a significant challenge, we will select models that meet a reasonable tradeoff between development cost and degree of realism.  The focus of these models will be on providing output for optimizing budget allocations to manage existing refuge resources and for designing an optimal expansion plan to maximize the long-term viability and benefits of a future refuge. \r\n\r\nIn addition to collaborating closely with NWR staff, we will work with resource economists and other social scientists to identify relevant stakeholders, quantify objectives and value the provision of ecosystem goods and services under current and future refuge designs. We will also engage with experts in coastal systems dynamics, risk hazard analysts and other specialists to predict changes to the biophysical processes of coastal resources.  Results, including predictive model outputs, interpretation and synthesis related to management objectives, GIS and model code script will be produced in a format to maximize the application of a decision framework and recommendations to the intended users."}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award

Dynamics: Implications for the Conservation of Amphibians in Tropical Environments","body":"Climate and land use change will strongly affect tropical island ecosystems and trust species. With limited land surface area, high rates of endemism, and maximal average planetary temperatures, the risks of significant negative impacts are likely to be higher in these systems than many temperate, mid-latitude regions of the earth. Complicating adaptation efforts is the lack of climate change guidance for decision makers due to the dearth of: (1) reliable climate change projections and, (2) species-specific climate sensitivity information. In FY2013, the SECSC began to address this need with the funded project, \" \n<a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/display-project\/4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c\/526eb46ee4b044919baefe0e\">Developing multi-model ensemble projections of ecologically relevant climate variables for Puerto Rico and the US Caribbean<\/a>\". This project is laying the foundation for more reliable climate change information by producing dynamically downscaled climate projections. These projections include fine-scale atmospheric processes that will mediate the local response to the global anthropogenic climate forcing. In addition, through the USGS Science Support Program, occupancy data has been collected for several amphibian species located in a target strategic habitat conservation region in the western portion of Puerto Rico.&nbsp; These data, along with data from two other taxa (avian, insect pollinators) will serve as the ecological input for an optimal decision-making framework for strategic habitat conservation sponsored by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources. This agency, in conjunction with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, needs to implement a strategic habitat conservation strategy that ensures the long-term persistence of amphibians and reptiles in Puerto Rico in the advent of climate change. These agencies seek to recover 11 species of terrestrial amphibians and reptiles with federal or state designations, but also to prevent listing additional species that might become at risk.&nbsp;\n<br> \n<br> Before specific climate-ready strategies can be developed for allocating scarce resources, further work is needed to better understand the level of dependence and key uncertainties between climate (particularly moisture-related variables) and the distribution and persistence of the species of conservation concern.&nbsp; We propose to quantify the effects of climate on the distribution and persistence of several amphibian species on the island of Puerto Rico.&nbsp;","parentId":"55130c81e4b02e76d75c075b","contacts":[{"name":"Jessica Stocking","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jaime A Collazo","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jaime_collazo@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Assistant Unit Leader Research Wildlife Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Jaime","middleName":"A","lastName":"Collazo","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9195154454","officePhone":"9195158837","streetAddress":{"zip":"27695-7617","city":"Raleigh","state":"NC","line1":"David Clark Labs, NC State Univ"},"buildingCode":"AVD","name":"Jaime A Collazo\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

We then look regionally to determine the extent to which trees in cities can be used to predict heat-related threats to rural forests (Obj. 2). We will leverage ongoing investigations of heat-related stress and pest outbreaks in urban and rural forests to develop management recommendations for both systems. These ongoing projects provide a knowledge-base, infrastructure (e.g. study sites), equipment (e.g. Li-Cor Photosynthesis System), and outreach opportunities that will extend the impact of this project (see Synergistic and Future Funding section below). We will also convene a working group to assess how urban environmental changes and tree cover affect human behavior and health (Obj. 3). Specifically, our objectives are to: 1. Determine tree (and arthropod) characteristics that affect tree-dependent biodiversity, tree herbivory, and resilience of both trees and biodiversity to warming. 2. Understand how urbanization (and heat) influences pest populations in order to predict future distributions of pests (and loss of biodiversity) in natural forests. 3.

For ectothermic animals, there is systematic latitudinal variation in the relationship between climate and thermal performance curves, which describe the relationship between temperature and an organism's fitness. Here, we ask whether these documented latitudinal patterns can be generalized to predict arthropod responses to warming across mid- and high temperate latitudes, for taxa whose thermal physiology has not been measured. To address this question, we used a novel natural experiment consisting of a series of urban warming gradients at different latitudes. Specifically, we sampled arthropods from a single common street tree species across temperature gradients in four US cities, located from 35.8 to 42.4\u00b0 latitude. We captured 6746 arthropods in 34 families from 111 sites that varied in summer average temperature by 1.7\u20133.4&nbsp;\u00b0C within each city. Arthropod responses to warming within each city were characterized as Poisson regression coefficients describing change in abundance per \u00b0C for each family. Family responses in the two midlatitude cities were heterogeneous, including significantly negative and positive effects, while those in high-latitude cities varied no more than expected by chance within each city. We expected high-latitude taxa to increase in abundance with warming, and they did so in one of the two high-latitude cities; in the other, Queens (New York City), most taxa declined with warming, perhaps due to habitat loss that was correlated with warming in this city. With the exception of Queens, patterns of family responses to warming were consistent with predictions based on known latitudinal patterns in arthropod physiology relative to regional climate. Heterogeneous responses in midlatitudes may be ecologically disruptive if interacting taxa respond oppositely to warming.","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","linkParentIds":["5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3","55fb1b80e4b05d6c4e501c10"],"contacts":[{"name":"Elsa Youngsteadt","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Andrew F.

However, no experiments to date test how warming affects mature tree carbon storage. Using a unique, citywide, factorial experiment, we investigated how warming and insect herbivory affected physiological function and carbon sequestration (carbon stored per year) of mature trees. Urban warming increased herbivorous arthropod abundance on trees, but these herbivores had negligible effects on tree carbon sequestration. Instead, urban warming was associated with an estimated 12% loss of carbon sequestration, in part because photosynthesis was reduced at hotter sites. Ecosystem service assessments that do not consider urban conditions may overestimate urban tree carbon storage. Because urban and global warming are becoming more intense, our results suggest that urban trees will sequester even less carbon in the future.","parentId":"526ebc6de4b044919baf1393","linkParentIds":["55fb1b80e4b05d6c4e501c10","5049f256e4b02b6b9f7bd8d3"],"contacts":[{"name":"The Royal Society","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Emily Meineke","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Elsa Youngsteadt","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Robert R.

These changes are and will continue to threaten wildlife and their habitats. Most existing conservation programs and activities, however, focus on maintaining systems in their current condition, or returning them to a historic state, rather than enabling systems to adapt to projected changes. Recognizing this problem state fish and wildlife agencies, together with US Fish and Wildlife Service and others, have initiated the <a href=\"http:\/\/secassoutheast.org\/\">Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy (SECAS)<\/a>. This project will support the SECAS effort, which aims to develop a collaborative network of conservation partners, shared conservation goals, and regional strategies to manage fish, wildlife, and other natural resources into the future. To help accomplish these goals, the project team will evaluate existing conservation plans and expected land and climate change impacts, and in collaboration with the Southeast conservation community, identify opportunities to incorporate landscape and climate change considerations into state and regional conservation actions. Issues facing selected focal systems, including pine savannah, will be addressed through structured workshops and decision analysis processes.

Our work will largely mirror key aspects of the climate-smart conservation process developed by the National Wildlife Federation in collaboration with multiple US federal agencies. First, we will develop a report that reviews and summarizes goals, objectives, and management actions in key federal, state, and local plans as well as other key strategy documents guiding decisions on SE species, priority ecosystems, and landscape-scale systems. Identification and selection of plans will be the result of consultation with project advisors and important SECAS stakeholders, with relevant plans expected to include not only wildlife management and conservation strategies, but also plans from other sectors important for driving landscape-scale changes (e.g., urban growth, bioenergy). Second, we will assess the goals and objectives highlighted in this report with respect to expected climate and land change impacts in the region. This assessment will begin with an overview of expected changes in the SE and potential impacts on regionally-important species and ecosystems, but will be augmented by more focused analyses of impacts on a limited number of key species and priority ecosystems. Third, based on results of the analysis of impacts and implications, we will initiate discussions with state and regional decision makers about how conservation goals and management objectives may need to be reformulated to become more \u201cclimate aligned,\u201d and to develop guiding principles and propositions that can be used to incorporate considerations of climate and landscape change into relevant decision processes. This stage of the project will require engagement with a variety of decision-makers and other stakeholders to ensure that the results are of maximum utility and are actionable by SECAS participants. Finally, the report and all documents reviewed together with visualizations of anticipated change will be placed in a section of the SE CSC Global Forum Website for open, one-stop access.   \r\nTo ensure maximum relevance for supporting the SECAS process, each of the four activities will engage the SE conservation community to gain their insights on both biophysical changes and governance issues and their support for the findings. In addition to working with a project advisory committee, we plan a meeting to introduce the project as well as a mid-project review of the draft report (either as an independent meeting, or in association with the SE conservation summit or other regional meetings). The introductory meeting would begin discussions of actionable principles and propositions and be used to gather input on key analytical issues for inclusion in the formal document text analysis and identify additional focus topics for impact analysis. The formal document analysis will be complemented by interviews with key agency personnel who can offer deeper insights into the document objectives, goals, and priorities. In conducting the document analysis, we will work with state agencies to assure that the review process includes the most current and significant plans (e.g. the revised SWAPs due in October 2015) as well as those specified in the RFP.  Interviews will also be used to obtain information about the challenges and opportunities that exist in implementing current or future conservation plans. The coding protocol will draw on insights from Dunlop et al. (2013) and Stein et al. (2014) in identifying general types of conservation goals strategies, scale mismatches, constraints, and limits. A more comprehensive document analysis will be conducted for selected priority species, ecosystems, and landscapes giving a detailed assessment of how the objectives are articulated and their value for decision making (see Gregory et al. 2012). The mid-project meeting will review the draft report and continue dialogue on principles and propositions.  The project team will assemble web content and the website development and design will be conducted by CSC staff to assure consistency with the current standards for DOI web products. Following completion of the report, we anticipate seeking additional support to facilitate dissemination and other engagement around the report and the resulting conservation and management principles. \r\n\r\n"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award

providing direction for collaborative conservation efforts. The SC agreed to pursue landscape conservation design (LCD) as a major emphasis of collaborative work and they agreed to adopt a values-focused, structured decision-making (SDM) process to guide conservation design development and implementation for the CLCC. Developing both a strategic plan and an implementation approach using a values focused LCD framework will have several advantages. This effort will complement existing conservation efforts in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands conducted by federal, state, and NGO organizations. This approach is focused by the values and priorities of organizations that are partners of the CLCC. One of the products of the LCD effort will be spatially-explicit mapped information (geologic, ecologic, socio-economic, climate, and vulnerabilities and threats) served via a web-based interface - the Caribbean Atlas for Management and Planning Options (el CAMPO).

Cultural resources represent evidence of past human activity, such as archeological sites, or are of significance to a group of people traditionally associated with the resource, such as Native American ceremonial sites.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> Climate change is challenging the long-term persistence of many cultural resources. For example, those located in coastal areas, such as historic lighthouses, are threatened by sea-level rise, shoreline erosion, and more frequent severe storm events. While climate change challenges managers of both natural and cultural resources to make decisions in the face of uncertainty, far less work has been done to identify the impacts of climate change on cultural resources, compared to natural resources.&nbsp;\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> To address this critical gap, researchers are developing a strategy to aid decision makers in climate adaptation planning efforts. The strategy integrates assessments of the relative significance of specific cultural resources and their vulnerability to climate change. The strategy will be pilot tested with a subset of buildings listed on the National Historic Register at Cape Look National Seashore, located on North Carolina\u2019s barrier islands.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> Cultural resources hold multiple and diverse values to local communities, visitors, and the general public.&nbsp; These resources are irreplaceable, and their meaning is often tied to their specific location. This project will contribute significantly to our understanding of the vulnerability of cultural resources to climate change throughout the southeastern U.S. and the role that historic significance should play in management decisions\u2014information that is vital for developing strategies to conserve these resources into the future.\n<\/div>","purpose":"This project brings cultural resource management into local and regional decision contexts for climate change planning. Cultural resources hold multiple and diverse values to local communities, visitors and the public. Yet, sea level rise and episodic storm events threaten many coastal cultural resources. Strategies for climate adaptation or mitigation need to emerge from values-based decision processes that enable evaluations of the vulnerability and uniqueness of resources on a landscape. Such efforts will facilitate the prioritization of specific cultural resource management actions (move, stabilize, or document a resource). This project will use structured decision-making (SDM) with National Park Service personnel and other key stakeholders to assist National Park Service managers assess strategies for managing cultural resources within Portsmouth Village and Lookout Village at Cape Lookout National Seashore.","parentId":"55130c81e4b02e76d75c075b","contacts":[{"name":"Erin Seekamp","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"elseekam@ncsu.edu","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"919-513-7407","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"27695-8004","country":"USA","city":"Raleigh","state":"NC","line1":"Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management\r\nCollege of Natural Resources\r\nBox 8004 Biltmore Hall"}}},{"name":"Jordan Smith","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jwsmit12@ncsu.edu","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"null","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"null","state":"null","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"Stacy Nelson","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"sanelso2@ncsu.edu","organization":{"displayText":"NC State University"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"null","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"null","state":"null","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"Matthew Booker","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"mmbooker@ncsu.edu","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"null","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"null","state":"null","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"Nils Peterson","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"nils_peterson@ncsu.edu","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"null","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"null","state":"null","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Janet Cakir","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"South Atlantic LCC"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Elise R Irwin","oldPartyId":4926,"type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"eirwin@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Assistant Unit Leader Research Fish Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Elise","middleName":"R","lastName":"Irwin","organization":{"displayText":"Alabama Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"3348849234","officePhone":"3348449190","streetAddress":{"zip":"36849","city":"Auburn","state":"AL","line1":"602 Duncan Dr"},"buildingCode":"AXC","name":"Elise R Irwin\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"36849-5418","country":"USA","city":"Auburn","state":"AL","line1":"602 Duncan Drive, Auburn University"},"building":"School of Forestry and Wildlife Services"}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"cultural resources"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"vulnerability index"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"structured decision making"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Southeast CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2015"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Start","dateString":"2015-08","label":"Start Date"},"1":{"type":"End","dateString":"2016-09","label":"End Date"},"2":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-04-13T07:21:30.501-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"3":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-27T19:40:16.708-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"start":"2015","end":"2016","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-04-13T07:21:30.501-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-27T19:40:16.708-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Technical Summary","value":"This project aims to: (a) develop a conceptual framework for assessing cultural resources for climate change planning and decision-making; (b) develop a landscape scale cultural resources vulnerability index (CRVI); and (c) test the application of the CRVI in a local scale structured decision making process. Cultural resource management (CRM) has focused on the values and meanings of resources in localized contexts and, thus, has relied on inductive decision-making. An analytic deliberative decision context that integrates climate science could enable the prioritization of types of cultural resources within a larger landscape; yet, evaluations of cultural resources\u2019 significance, association and integrity may be altered when evaluated in relation to the vulnerability of similar types of cultural resources within a regional landscape. At the landscape-level, the role of \u201cplace\u201d within CRM is decontextualized and may need to be re-contextualized into local-level decision processes. This project begins by conducting a detailed review of CRM in practice (management and planning documents) and theory (peer-reviewed publications) to develop a multi-dimensional, multi-value and multi-attribute conceptual framework for assessing cultural resources in the context of climate change. With the input of a project advisory board (created through a stakeholder identification process), a cultural resource vulnerability index (CRVI)\u2014based on climate change models\u2014will be developed using a Delphi process that develops a cultural resources typology and a forum for refining the tool. The CRVI will be presented to CRM professionals and LCC stakeholders and further refined in a regional workshop. The CRVI\u2019s practical implications be assessed in a structured decision making (SDM) process of Portsmouth Village (Cape Lookout National Seashore) that will also be informed by field research (historical, ethnographic, and visitor studies) to assess role of place and provide voice to stakeholders, thereby recontextualizing place in the discussion. A repeated measures survey tool will be used to assess the influence of the CRVI and the local context on the CRM decisions reached during the SDM."}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Type","value":"Grant"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award

Historically, many coastal ecosystems have adapted to sea-level fluctuations via horizontal and vertical movement on the landscape. However, anthropogenic activities, including urbanization and the construction of flood-prevention infrastructure, can produce barriers that impede adaptation. In a recent study, we identified areas where tidal saline wetlands may adapt via landward migration along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast, one of the most sea-level rise sensitive and wetland-rich regions of the world. Our analyses collectively provided information that can be used to identify migration corridors and develop future-focused sea-level rise adaptation strategies that will improve the potential that the ecosystem goods and services provided by tidal saline wetlands will continue to be available for future generations. This project was a multi-Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) project that included the four Gulf coast LCCs (i.e., Gulf Coast Prairie, Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks, South Atlantic, and Peninsular Florida LCCs). The products and analyses from this work were produced at the region scale (i.e., all five Gulf coast states). However, there is much potential to use these data for customized analyses focused on landscape conservation design within specific estuaries (e.g., estuaries that contain ecologically-significant National Wildlife Refuges, National Estuarine Research Reserves, National Estuary Programs). Here we will perform follow-up work focused on the evaluation of landward migration corridors. We will work with LCC staff and partners from the four Gulf coast LCCs to identify 1-2 estuaries per LCC (4-8 estuaries total) for customized analyses. Within each of these estuaries, we will work with these partners to produce customized landscape conservation-design products focused on landward migration corridors for coastal wetlands. In broad terms, the aim of the proposed work is to provide scientific information that can be used by environmental managers to enhance the adaptive capacity of coastal wetlands in the face of sea-level rise and coastal development. The two PIs for this project are both at the USGS Wetland and Aquatic Research Center. The project will provide valuable experience and opportunities for two early-career researchers (a recent M.S. graduate and a current Ph.D. student). The formal products of the proposed research will include, at a minimum, a peer-reviewed publication and a webinar for natural resource managers."}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"}],"files":[{"imageWidth":910,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-10-25T18:03:18.000Z","title":"Everglades National Park - Credit: Alan Cressler","imageHeight":683,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__c9%2Fa2%2F8c%2Fc9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a","processed":false,"size":216551,"useForPreview":true,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"a46fa2b501ee68c5d65b648f34ce4ab0"},"name":"EvergladesNP2_AlanCressler.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__c9\/a2\/8c\/c9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a","contentType":"image\/jpeg"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"EnhancingtheCap.zip","files":""}],"realParentId":"4f8c652fe4b0546c0c397b4a","csc":"Southeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6557e4b0546c0c397b4c","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Michael Osland"],"orgs":["South Central CSC","Southeast CSC"],"funding_years":"2016","fy":"2016","children":[]},"5813ac7de4b0d63fd467bb68":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"5813ac7de4b0d63fd467bb68","title":"Identifying Conservation Objectives for the Gulf Coast Habitats of the Black Skimmer and Gull-billed Tern","body":"<div>Many shorebirds and nearshore waterbirds are of conservation concern across the Gulf of Mexico due to stressors such as human disturbance, predation, and habitat loss and degradation.

Yet, these species do not have habitat objectives. Therefore, the project goal is to develop conceptual models link each species abundance to habitat characteristics that could be influenced by management actions, translate the conceptual models into quantitative models and then use the quantitative model outputs to derive habitat objectives for each species under different conservation

Conservation of Animals in the Southeastern Longleaf Pine Ecosystem","body":"The southeastern U.S. is home to more than half of the animal and plant species that are being reviewed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to determine if they are threatened or endangered due to losses or changes in habitat. The longleaf pine ecosystem, which is native to the southeastern U.S., supports several animal species that are considered a priority to be reviewed, based on significant threats, how much knowledge we have about the species, and opportunities for conserving them. These include the gopher tortoise, striped newt, gopher frog, southern hognose snake, and Florida pine snake. This ecosystem also supports a large number of priority plants. State wildlife agencies in the Southeast are partnering with USFWS to assess the status of these species and to implement actions that will protect and restore them on public and private lands.<br>\n<br>\nThis project will build on studies related to the gopher tortoise that are already underway by the USGS and will engage collaborations with other partners conducting species assessments to identify conservation actions expected to improve the status of five priority at-risk species (mentioned above) in the longleaf pine ecosystem. These actions will be based on an updated analysis of the status and distribution of these species and their habitats, current and future threats to these habitats, and the likelihood that specific actions will achieve their intended effect.<br>\n<br>\nThis work will accelerate efforts needed to prevent the potential loss of species in this important ecosystem, especially with projected changes in climate and urban growth.","parentId":"5813a352e4b0d63fd467bb00","contacts":[{"name":"Clinton Moore","type":"Principal

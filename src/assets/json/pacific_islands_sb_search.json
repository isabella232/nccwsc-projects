Increasing production of locally-grown food crops helps increase self-sufficiency and address nutritional problems that lead to high rates of diabetes and cardiovascular disease caused in part by over dependence on imported food. Planting can also be used as one tool to stabilize vulnerable shorelines impacted by erosion and sea level rise. Climate change impacts such as seawater intrusion, changes in precipitation, sea level rise, increasing air temperature and invasive species are making agriculture more difficult for island inhabitants to conduct. The unpredictability of environmental changes is particularly worrisome for agriculture producers as they can no longer necessarily follow traditional planting schedules or determine which species\/cultivars are best to produce for a given situation.<br>\n<br>\nA first step towards addressing the vulnerability of agriculture and agroforestry is to provide information in accessible, real time data products. Hence a \u201cdashboard\u201d will be developed that will provide a variety of relevant data sources to users, particularly extension agents, government personnel and educators that support the agriculture and forestry sectors. Some agricultural practitioners will also be able to use the dashboard if they have internet access and some level of education. Additionally, we will move beyond the dashboard concept to provide web-based access to critical information such as environmental tolerances of various crops, agricultural practices, modern and traditional uses for individual crops, nutritional values and other information that may be useful. Hard copies of key data products will be produced for users that cannot access the internet site, and some will be translated to Marshallese. The research team will work closely with stakeholders in the Marshall Islands and other Pacific Islands to ensure that the data provided is relevant, accessible and complete. The expected outcome is that Pacific Island users will have improved access to information that will enhance their ability to support and engage in agriculture and forestry activities to improve food security and overall community resilience to climate change impacts.<\/div>\n","parentId":"5362adade4b0c409c6289bab","contacts":[{"name":"Maria Haws","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai`i at Hilo"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jonathan Deenik","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai`i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Kathleen Friday","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USDA Forest Service"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Anthony Ingersoll","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Rebecca Lorennij","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Republic of the Marshall Islands, Ministry of Resources & Development"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Karl Fellenius","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"College of the Marshall Islands\/Sea Grant"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"John Marra","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"NOAA"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pacific Islands CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Pacific Islands CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"},{"name":"Agroforestry"},{"name":"Sea level rise"},{"name":"Marshall Islands"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-10-01","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2016-09-30","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-05-20T13:41:20.025-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-29T13:44:33.156-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"FY 14 Grant","value":"G14AP00184"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":0}],"files":[{"imageWidth":4606,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":3383129,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-01-28T14:33:08.000Z","name":"PI-2014-1_MarshallIslands_SarahNash1.JPG","pathOnDisk":"__disk__99\/91\/44\/999144af85f85130760f5715e5a1a43772f3b7ca","title":"The Marshall Islands -

To estimate native and invasive species abundance in baseline climate conditions, a map was generated that considered abundance as percent cover and used high coefficient of variation values as a mask. The primary sources for post-processing the uncertainty masks are the Hawaiian Islands plant species abundance modeled means and standard deviation values (Wong et al., in preparation). These maps cover the entire landscape (including urban and agricultural areas), and therefore they can be applied in a variety of ways. Maps can be utilized to evaluate baseline climate conditions for each species and to forecast changes to community structure through expected shifts in species abundance. Maps can be combined in order to predict community dominance, for example, by identifying the most abundant native species at a given location. This can be applied to: 1) spatial and temporal assessments of habitat quality and community structure comparisons; 2) defining specific ecological restoration objectives; and 3) identifying potential for key invasive species to threaten a site (even where they are presently not found). Future projected abundances can enhance conservation planning both by anticipating where native species may increase or decrease in abundance and by identifying areas where invasive species may extend their range. Combining this with assessments of relative response rates can aid managers in prioritizing native species to promote and invasive species to preemptively control at a given site. Purpose: These data were compiled to provide context from other data products (e.g., correlative species abundance model maps, standard deviation value maps, habitat quality maps, and species relative response characteristics) such that areas with high uncertainty were identified and removed from species abundance model maps developed by Wong et al. (in preparation). These post-processed maps contribute to an initial set of supporting tools for managers and decision makers. However, given the inconsistency of their statistical performance between evaluation metrics, some of these exploratory abundance maps should be used with caution and with reference to high levels of uncertainty. As is the case with other macro-scale correlative models, they should be applied to management at a conceptual, landscape scale rather than for detailed management at local sites.","parentId":"5046314fe4b0241d49d62c06","linkParentIds":["55934704e4b0b6d21dd67fe5"],"browseCategories":["Data"],"browseTypes":["ArcGIS Service Definition","Downloadable","Map Service","ArcGIS REST Map Service"],"systemTypes":["Folder","Downloadable","Mappable"],"tags":[{"name":"climate change"},{"name":"PICSC"},{"name":"CSCs"},{"name":"hawaii"},{"name":"native plants"},{"name":"invasive plants"},{"name":"conservation"}],"dates":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-07-31T14:33:49.259-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-08-01T19:46:27.213-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"boundingBox":{"minY":18.797656391,"minX":-159.834703054,"maxY":22.326877913119,"maxX":-154.567982359},"filePathUsed":"__disk__9d\/d2\/c4\/9dd2c44413f462014a86459c03842d563e403685","processingState":"success","facetName":"ArcGIS Service Definition","serverType":"","servicePath":"55bbdbade4b033ef52100e2a","name":"Price_SD.sd","processingMessage":"","files":[{"originalMetadata":true,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":10161777,"dateUploaded":"2015-09-16T20:24:04.000Z","name":"Price_SD.sd","pathOnDisk":"__disk__9d\/d2\/c4\/9dd2c44413f462014a86459c03842d563e403685","title":"","contentType":"x-gis\/x-arcgis-service-def","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55bbdbade4b033ef52100e2a?f=__disk__9d%2Fd2%2Fc4%2F9dd2c44413f462014a86459c03842d563e403685"},{"imageWidth":200,"size":5205,"dateUploaded":"2015-09-16T20:24:20.792Z","name":"thumbnail.png","pathOnDisk":"__disk__55\/a3\/ed\/55a3edeb7601e39e6828e2b15b268f9f30e23dac","contentType":"image\/png","imageHeight":133,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55bbdbade4b033ef52100e2a?f=__disk__55%2Fa3%2Fed%2F55a3edeb7601e39e6828e2b15b268f9f30e23dac"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ServiceDefinitionFacet","enabledServices":["KmlServer","WMSServer"],"serviceId":"55bbdbade4b033ef52100e2a"}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":9539549,"dateUploaded":"2015-08-11T22:56:04.000Z","name":"All_spp_tifs.zip","pathOnDisk":"__disk__9d\/21\/8d\/9d218d4bf1a2b73bee5e2ab3e7ffafd8a5caac61","title":"","contentType":"application\/zip","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55bbdbade4b033ef52100e2a?f=__disk__9d%2F21%2F8d%2F9d218d4bf1a2b73bee5e2ab3e7ffafd8a5caac61"},{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":5354987,"dateUploaded":"2015-08-11T22:56:14.000Z","name":"All_spp_metadata.zip","pathOnDisk":"__disk__ae\/93\/bc\/ae93bcabeacf3c5b026cc48c2130974381b1649a","title":"","contentType":"application\/zip","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55bbdbade4b033ef52100e2a?f=__disk__ae%2F93%2Fbc%2Fae93bcabeacf3c5b026cc48c2130974381b1649a"},{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":553261,"dateUploaded":"2015-08-11T22:56:30.000Z","name":"Price_Wong_Jacobi - Species Abundance Modeling Final Report for PICSC.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__22\/25\/0e\/22250e522d7aaf7945087a0574626649f5ac0573","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55bbdbade4b033ef52100e2a?f=__disk__22%2F25%2F0e%2F22250e522d7aaf7945087a0574626649f5ac0573"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/arcgis\/rest\/services\/Catalog\/55bbdbade4b033ef52100e2a\/MapServer","title":"ArcGIS REST Service","type":"serviceLink","typeLabel":"Service Link","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55bbdbade4b033ef52100e2a","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"2015HawaiianIsl.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Pacific Islands CSC","parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48"},"50118ddce4b0d78fd4e59ba3":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"50118ddce4b0d78fd4e59ba3","title":"21st Century High-Resolution Climate Projections for Guam and American Samoa","body":"<p>The Pacific Islands are expected to be particularly vulnerable to the anticipated impacts of climate change due to their small, geographically isolated ecosystems and economies, and are extremely susceptible to rising sea-levels.

Results show that the commonly used VWS measure between 200 and 850 hPa is less representative of the attenuating deep-layer shear effect than that between 300 and 1000 hPa. Moreover, the authors find that the low-level shear between 850 (or 700) and 1000 hPa is more negatively correlated with TC intensity change than any deep-layer shear during the active typhoon season, whereas deep-layer shear turns out to be more influential than low-level shear during the remaining less active seasons. Further analysis covering all seasons exhibits that a TC has a better chance to intensify than to decay when the deep-layer shear is lower than 7\u20139 m s \n<sup>\u22121<\/sup>&nbsp;and the low-level shear is below 2.5 m s \n<sup>\u22121<\/sup>. The probability for TCs to intensify and undergo rapid intensification (RI) increases with decreasing VWS and increasing sea surface temperature (SST). TCs moving at slow translational speeds (less than 3 m s \n<sup>\u22121<\/sup>) intensify under relatively weaker VWS than TCs moving at intermediate translational speeds (3\u20138 m s \n<sup>\u22121<\/sup>). The probability of RI becomes lower than that of rapid decaying (RD) when the translational speed is larger than 8 m s \n<sup>\u22121<\/sup>. Most TCs tend to decay when the translational speed is larger than 12 m s \n<sup>\u22121<\/sup>&nbsp;regardless of the shear condition.","parentId":"522e2426e4b065b29d2812f5","contacts":[{"name":"Yuqing Wang","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Yunjie Rao","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Zhe-Min Tan","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Nanjing University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Daria Sch\u00f6nemann","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pacific Islands CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/journals.ametsoc.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1175\/MWR-D-15-0049.1","title":"Wang et al. 2015","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"hurricanes"},{"name":"typhoons"},{"name":"cyclones"},{"name":"statistics"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015-09","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-09-24T09:54:49.733-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-09-24T10:00:42.248-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"American Meteorological Society","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1175\/MWR-D-15-0049.1"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Pacific Islands CSC","parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48","people":["Yuqing Wang","Yunjie Rao","Zhe-Min Tan","Daria Sch\u00f6nemann"],"orgs":["Pacific Islands CSC"]},"56a7948ce4b0b28f1184d8e3":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/559afca9e4b0b94a64016ff9","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"An Assessment of Diurnal and Seasonal Cloud Cover Changes over the Hawaiian Islands Using Terra and Aqua MODIS","relatedTitle":"Cloud Water Interception in Hawai\u2018i: Developing Capacity to Characterize the Spatial Patterns and Effects on Water and Ecological Processes","id":"56a7948ce4b0b28f1184d8e3","relatedId":"559afca9e4b0b94a64016ff9","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/56a7948ce4b0b28f1184d8e3","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Cloud Water Interception in Hawai\u2018i: Developing Capacity to Characterize the Spatial Patterns and Effects on Water and Ecological Processes","relatedTitle":"An Assessment of Diurnal and Seasonal Cloud Cover Changes over the Hawaiian Islands Using Terra and Aqua MODIS","id":"559afca9e4b0b94a64016ff9","relatedId":"56a7948ce4b0b28f1184d8e3","annotation":null}]},"id":"56a7948ce4b0b28f1184d8e3","title":"An Assessment of Diurnal and Seasonal Cloud Cover Changes over the Hawaiian Islands Using Terra and Aqua MODIS","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/journals.ametsoc.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1175\/JCLI-D-15-0088.1):&nbsp;A comprehensive understanding of the spatial, seasonal, and diurnal patterns in cloud cover frequency over the Hawaiian Islands was developed using high-resolution image data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard the&nbsp; \n<em>Terra<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp; \n<em>Aqua<\/em>&nbsp;satellites. The&nbsp; \n<em>Terra<\/em>&nbsp;and \n<em>Aqua<\/em>&nbsp;MODIS cloud mask products, which provide the confidence that a given 1-km pixel is unobstructed by cloud, were obtained for the entire MODIS time series (10-plus years) over the main Hawaiian Islands. Monthly statistics were generated from the daily cloud mask data, including mean cloud cover frequency at the four daily overpass times. The derived mean cloud cover frequency showed patterns that were generally consistent with the known distribution of mean rainfall and with the results from previous studies. Cloud cover frequency was the highest over land areas with elevations between the lifting condensation level (~600 m) and the mean height of the trade wind inversion (TWI) base (~2200 m), especially for the windward (northeastern) mountain slopes. Above the TWI, cloud frequency decreased sharply with elevation. Irrespective of season, cloud cover frequency was generally higher in the afternoon than in the morning and higher in daytime than at nighttime although these trends varied spatially. The dry season months (May\u2013October) were less cloudy than the wet season months (November\u2013April) at nighttime. The analysis also revealed a local December\u2013January minimum in the annual cycle of cloud cover frequency. The monthly time series produced in this study is the first high-spatial-resolution cloud cover dataset in Hawaii.","parentId":"559aff57e4b0b94a64017014","contacts":[{"name":"Mallory L.

The key objective of this project was to combine climate projections from the International Pacific Research Center (IPRC) and plant distribution models from Price et al. to produce a series of projected species range maps over the next century. Although the project focused on HAVO, the projected species range maps were created for seven of the main Hawaiian Islands. We stored the model output as rasters (.TIF files); additionally we created multi-panel maps of these rasters that are available separately. In summary, this dataset consists of 4,095 rasters that delineate plant species range, both present and future, for various climate change scenarios and years. The series covers 39 species, 7 islands, and 15 different combinations of climate trajectory and year. The contents of each raster varies slightly, but the contents can be determined from the specific filename. Filenames have a consistent naming convenion, as follows: Species name + island + file type + climate trajectory + year.TIF, where the following definitions apply: Species name = abbreviated code representing genus and species; Island = 1 of the main 7 Hawaiian Islands (Hawaii, Maui, Kahoolwe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, and Kauai); File type = one of 3 file types: (1) RANGE = present species range as of year 2000, (2) 80 PCT = binary raster of habitat suitability, (3) CHANGE TO 80 = raster showing the change in suitability between the year 2000 and the year indicated in the file name; Climate trajectory = lower (concave upward trajectory of change in rainfall and temperature over the century), middle (linear change in rainfall and temperature), upper (concave downward trajectory of change in rainfall and temperature), or future (where all three trajectories converge in 2090); Year = one of the following years: 2000, 2040, 2070, or 2090. For example, consider this filename: Acakoa Hawaii 80 pct future2090.tif. This filename defines the following: Species name = Acakoa (Acacia koa), Island = Hawaii island, File type = 80 pct, indicating that it is a binary raster of habitat suitability where a value of 1 means 80% of model iterations forecast suitable habitat, and a value of 0 means less than 80% of model runs project suitability, Climate trajectory = future, which represents the point in the future (2090) where the lower, middle and upper trajectories converge, Year = 2090 (end of century since that's when our climate data set series ends).","purpose":"The rasters produced in this study show the projected species range of 39 plant species at various points in time (from 2000-2090) and for various trajectories of climate change. The focus of this study was to project plant species range within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (HAVO) on the island of Hawaii over the next century (2000-2090). In spite of this focus, the geographic extent of the modelling included 7 islands (Hawaii, Maui, Kahoolwe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, and Kauai).","parentId":"5362af7ae4b0c409c6289bd4","contacts":[{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey, PACIFIC REGION","type":"Point of

important part of resilience-based management (RBM) and can help prioritize and target management actions. Use of such assessments has been limited due to a lack of clear guidance on the assessment process. This study builds on the latest scientific advances in RBM to provide that guidance from a resilience assessment undertaken in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). We assessed spatial variation in ecological resilience potential at 78 forereef sites near the populated islands of the CNMI: Saipan, Tinian\/Aguijan, and Rota. The assessments are based on measuring indicators of resilience processes and are combined with information on anthropogenic stress and larval connectivity. We find great spatial variation in relative resilience potential with many high resilience sites near Saipan (5 of 7) and low resilience sites near Rota (7 of 9). Criteria were developed to identify priority sites for six types of management actions (e.g., conservation, land-based sources of pollution reduction, and fishery management and enforcement) and 51 of the 78 sites met at least one of the sets of criteria. The connectivity simulations developed indicate that Tinian and Aguijan are each roughly 10&nbsp;\u00d7 the larvae source that Rota is and twice as frequent a destination. These results may explain the lower relative resilience potential of Rota reefs and indicates that actions in Saipan and Tinian\/Aguijan will be important to maintaining supply of larvae. The process we describe for undertaking resilience assessments can be tailored for use in coral reef areas globally and applied to other ecosystems.","parentId":"522e2076e4b065b29d2812e7","contacts":[{"name":"Jeffrey Maynard","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Marine Applied Research Center, Wilmington, NC"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Steven McKagan","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"NOAA Fisheries"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Laurie Raymundo","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Guam"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Steven Johnson","oldPartyId":64318,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"Steven_Johnson@fws.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Librarian","firstName":"Steven","middleName":"SJ","lastName":"Johnson","cellPhone":"9074412810","organization":{"displayText":"University of Guam"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9077867652","officePhone":"19077867661","streetAddress":{"zip":"99503","country":"US","city":"Anchorage","state":"AK","line1":"1011 East Tudor Road"},"name":"CN=Steven Johnson,OU=ABA Users,OU=ifw7RO,OU=r7,DC=fws,DC=doi,DC=net - Primary Location","mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Gabby N.

Already, high elevation areas have experienced rapidly increasing temperatures and there has been an increase in the frequency of drought across the Islands. These climatic changes could have significant impacts on Hawai`i\u2019s plants and animals. Changes in temperature and moisture may make current habitat no longer suitable for some species, and could allow invasive species to spread into new areas.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nHawai`i Volcanoes National Park is home to 23 species of endangered vascular plants and 15 species of endangered trees. Understanding how climate change may impact the park\u2019s plants is vital for their long-term survival. This project will assist managers of Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park in preparing for a changing climate by identifying how plant distributions within the park may shift under future climate conditions. Researchers will focus on the park\u2019s Special Ecological Areas \u2013 sites of critical importance roughly configured to protect representative plant communities and important species by controlling the most invasive incipient plants and animals. Researchers will identify how plants may migrate to new locations and contract from current locations as species distributions respond to habitat suitability under future climate conditions, and will map future plant species ranges. This information will then be used resource managers to determine whether the boundaries of the Special Ecological Areas need to be adjusted to account for future shifts in plant ranges.<\/div>\n&nbsp;<br>\nInformation on how climate change may alter plant distributions, including those of endangered and culturally-significant species, is required for effective management of the park\u2019s ecosystems into the future. The results of this project will help park managers overcome one of the greatest hurdles facing resource managers today \u2013 developing climate adaptation strategies in the face of an uncertain future.","purpose":"Changing global climate conditions are becoming well documented in the scientific literature, with news stories mentioning that storm frequency and strength are increasing and changes in precipitation are leading to flooding in some areas and drought in other areas. Two major driving forces of climate change are temperature and precipitation. In Hawai`i, temperatures are expected to increase and precipitation decrease, which are likely to result in an increased frequency and intensity of droughts through the twenty-first century. These climate changes have potentially large impacts on Hawaiian plants and animals. Managers at Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park want to know how climate change may shift plant distributions, especially in the highly managed Special Ecological Areas (SEAs), focal sites to manage rare and endangered plants. Results from this research will inform managers as to how vegetation types will migrate across the Park, and if species can successfully establish in more suitable sites. With our results, Park management may 1) prioritize the rank and management of existing SEAs; 2) determine new areas to improve and protect plants and communities that may benefit from SEA management or may require additional or changed management; and 3) develop a restoration plan for the Kahuku Unit.","parentId":"5362adade4b0c409c6289bab","linkParentIds":["55934704e4b0b6d21dd67fe5"],"contacts":[{"name":"James D Jacobi","oldPartyId":4974,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jjacobi@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Botanist (Research)","firstName":"James","middleName":"D","lastName":"Jacobi","organization":{"displayText":"Kilauea Field Station, PIERC"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8089678568","streetAddress":{"zip":"96813-5415","country":"US","city":"Honolulu","state":"HI","line1":"677 Ala Moana Blvd. Suite 415"},"buildingCode":"WHD","name":"James D Jacobi\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"96813-5417","country":"USA","city":"Honolulu","state":"HI","line1":"677 Ala Moana Blvd. Suite 615"},"building":"Gold Bond Building"}},{"name":"S.

We will statistically downscale the model-resolution projections to 4 km, which resolves much of the local-scale variation in warming rates around islands and ensures projections can inform local-scale management decision-making. The Google Earth (GE) tool that will present the projections will also show the locations of culturally important sites in Guam and CNMI we aim to identify through collaborating with 10+ culture, arts, and historical preservation societies.  The downscaled projections will be used in outlook reports we propose to develop for Tumon Bay in Guam, Lao Lao Bay and Saipan Lagoon, Saipan, and northern Tinian Island. The outlook reports will follow the framework pioneered by Australia\u2019s GBRMPA, compiling current information on ecosystem state and pressures and the effects of current and alternative management responses on the sustainability of goods and services provision.  Anticipated products include: 1) a GE tool complete with introductory material and a user guide, 2) two peer-reviewed journal publications, 3) 4 completed outlook reports with 1-page \u2018report-card\u2019 summaries, 4) a guidance document for others on preparing outlook reports, and 5) text and graphics for local agency websites. Our plan for information sharing\/communication includes meetings with managers, fact sheets and project updates, websites and webinars. The multi-disciplinary team includes expertise in coral reef ecology, climate science, decision science, modeling, anthropology and social science and includes three resource managers based in Saipan, CNMI with NOAA Fisheries and the CNMI (BECQ)."}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Type","value":"Grant"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Number","value":"G15AP00059"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":179695,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":107335},{"year":"2016","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":72360}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":2046,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":933096,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2016-05-31T11:29:01.000Z","name":"PI-2015-1_BentSeaRod_Bleaching_KelseyRoberts_USGS.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__1f\/5c\/21\/1f5c21c8e4acd78726476211aec33d72daafd3ee","title":"Bleached bent sea rod coral - Credit: Kelsey Roberts, USGS","contentType":"image\/jpeg","imageHeight":1534,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/551eda81e4b027f0aee3ba05?f=__disk__1f%2F5c%2F21%2F1f5c21c8e4acd78726476211aec33d72daafd3ee"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=551eda81e4b027f0aee3ba05&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=551eda81e4b027f0aee3ba05&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=551eda81e4b027f0aee3ba05&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=551eda81e4b027f0aee3ba05","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/551eda81e4b027f0aee3ba05\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/551eda81e4b027f0aee3ba05","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"AssessingtheSus.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Pacific Islands CSC","parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Laurie Raymundo","Jeffrey  Maynard","John Peterson","Peter Houk","Ruben van Hooidonk","Steven McKagan","Lyza Johnston","Robert Greene"],"orgs":["Pacific Islands CSC"],"funding_years":"2015","fy":"2015"},"5011925fe4b0d78fd4e59baa":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"5011925fe4b0d78fd4e59baa","title":"Assessing Viability of the Haleakal\u0101 Silversword to Uncover the Effects of Climate Change on Hawai\u02c8i\u2019s High-Elevation Ecosystems","body":"<div>Maui\u2019s threatened Haleakal\u0101 silversword forms the foundation of a diverse high-elevation community on Haleakal\u0101, and is an ideal species for assessing how this ecosystem is responding to climate change.

Exceptions, such as the case of the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, can provide important insights into the complexity of biological responses to changing climate conditions. We present a time series of decadal population censuses, combined with a pair of early population projections, which together span the past 80 years of demographic history for this alpine plant.<br> <br> <strong>Results<\/strong><br> The time series suggests a strong population recovery from the 1930s through the 1980s, likely owing at least in part to management actions taken on its behalf. In contrast, the population is estimated to have suffered a decline of approximately 60 % since the early 1990s. Fine-scale estimates of rainfall within silversword habitat are strongly correlated with these decadal-scale population changes over the past 50 years, with rainfall estimated to be substantially lower on average during the two most recent inter-census periods (after 1991). The reversal in the silversword population trajectory, and declines in rainfall in silversword habitat, coincide with an abrupt increase in the frequency of occurrence of the trade wind inversion (TWI) in Hawai\u02bbi around 1990.<br> <br> <strong>Conclusions<\/strong><br> The shift in TWI incidence, which is linked to stronger subsidence in the Hadley circulation, has led to drier conditions in high elevation ecosystems in Hawai\u02bbi and appears to be eliciting ecological responses. Other regions influenced by the TWI could be similarly affected. The silversword case study reveals additional unexpected outcomes, such as the likely initial retraction from wetter, rather than drier, portions of the range in response to drying conditions. This pattern may stem in part from variation in drought tolerance across the range, highlighting the importance of detailed ecological and climatic information for making accurate predictions about climate change responses.<\/p>","parentId":"504632afe4b0241d49d62c17","contacts":[{"name":"Paul D.

Once it reaches the ground, rain can either run off and contribute to water flow in streams, or it can infiltrate into the ground and provide water for plants and recharge aquifers and groundwater. The exact route that water takes is controlled by many factors, including the duration and intensity of rainfall, the topography of the land, soil properties, and vegetation.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThe introduction and spread of invasive plants and animals in Hawaiian forests, which alters the water-use and soil characteristics of ecosystems, can have large impacts on downstream water users.

Project researchers are exploring the differences in key soil characteristics that control runoff and groundwater recharge in managed and relatively intact native mesic (moderate amounts of water) and wet forests and in similar invasive-dominated forests. Primary soil characteristics of interest are the hydraulic conductivity of soils (ability of water to move through soils) and soil hydrophobicity (a property that causes water to collect on the surface rather than infiltrating into the ground). Data will also be collected on the canopy and understory composition in the forests and on disturbances by invasive animals, like feral pigs. Results from the study will be presented in reports and maps of vegetation and soil characteristics across the Hawaiian Islands under current and future conditions.&nbsp;<\/div>\n","purpose":"The overall objective of this work is to understand how rapidly expanding invasive plant population distributions coupled with changes in inter-species competitive dynamics (caused by projected shifting rainfall patterns) will impact water resources into the future. Local studies have highlighted how invasive plants and disturbance of the ground-cover vegetation by feral ungulates may alter soil characteristics critical to determining runoff and groundwater recharge (Perkins et al., 2012, 2014). Other efforts have suggested that invasive species, both plant and animal, have altered whole watershed water balances (Giambelluca et al., 2007; 2008; Strauch et al., in preparation) and possibly landscape groundwater recharge (Engott, 2011; Brauman et al., 2012; 2014). However, a landscape-level understanding of the impact of invasive species on water resources both island and state wide is still lacking. Our proposed work will explore the differences in key soil characteristics that control runoff and groundwater recharge across managed and relatively intact native mesic and wet forest communities. To explore the ecohydrological impact of invasion in these communities, we will conduct similar sampling in disturbed, invasive-dominated community types that most frequently replace the native communities considered. Specifically, we will be measuring Ksat (field-saturated hydraulic conductivity) and soil hydrophobicity. Ongoing and projected climate shifts are expected to directly and indirectly impact runoff\/recharge in multiple ways. Based on differential soil characteristics among native and invaded community types considered, climate-based changes in runoff\/recharge may be evaluated by integrating our field-data results with maps of baseline and future native-forest distributions (Fortini et al., 2015) and potential invasive species spread (Vorsino et al., 2013, Fortini et al., in preparation).","parentId":"576d735ce4b07657d1a3767d","contacts":[{"name":"Lucas Fortini","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"lfortini@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Lucas","lastName":"Fortini","cellPhone":"8082303669","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Pacific Islands Ecosystem Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"8086876158","streetAddress":{"zip":"96818","country":"US","city":"Honolulu","state":"HI","line1":"1845 Wasp Boulevard, Bld 176"},"buildingCode":"WFI","name":"Lucas Fortini\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"96813-5417","country":"USA","city":"Honolulu","state":"HI","line1":"677 Ala Moana Blvd. Suite 615"},"building":"Daniel K.

Ecosystem Management: An Integrated Approach","body":"In the expectation that global climate will change steadily in the coming decades, this research project had the goal to obtain a more detailed view of the climatic changes that Hawai\u2019i could experience by the mid and late 21st century. Given the importance of rainfall for Hawaiian ecosystems and freshwater reserves, this project investigated past seasonal rainfall pattern and developed a statistical model to estimate future rainfall changes for the major islands. As a result of this research, high-resolution maps and data are now available that researchers can use to study potential impacts on endangered species, or use the rainfall changes as input in decision-support tools.This data product provides data files that present future climate change rainfall scenarios for the Hawaiian Islands. The data products are served in GIS compatible formats, text-based spreadsheet tables, and the scientific data format NetCDF. Furthermore, figure files in PDF format are part of the distribution. The data product contains information on future rainfall change scenarios for the main Hawaiian Islands (Kauai, Oahu, Maui Nui, and Hawaii) for two time periods in the 21st century 2041-2070 and 2071-2099. In addition, some information from the historical 19th to 20th century are provided. The statistical downscaling method worked with station rainfall data. Geospatial interpolation methods were applied to create spatially interpolated gridded maps and contour files for the main Hawaiian Islands. The rainfall anomaly maps are provided in different resolutions (3km, 250m, and 0.5 minute resolution in longitude and latitude). In addition to the anomaly maps, we included seasonal rainfall climatology maps as references (base maps). These base maps, which were obtained from the Rainfall Atlas of Hawaii products (Giambelluca et al., 2013; http:\/\/rainfall.geography.hawaii.edu\/) are provided at 250m resolution. This data product contains spatially interpolated maps with information on the skill of the statistical downscaling method. These data files and maps serve as a guidance for the user, in which regions the downscaled rainfall scenarios come with lower or higher confidence. In addition the product provides maps in 3km resolution with statistics on the frequency of future rainfall anomalies in five distinct categories: very dry, dry, neutral, wet, very wet conditions (details are provided in the accompanying README file that is part of this distribution).

In addition, much of this biodiversity loss will likely go unobserved, and therefore largely unappreciated. The Haleakal\u0101 silversword is restricted to a single volcano summit in Hawai\u2018i, but is a highly charismatic giant rosette plant that is viewed by 1-2 million visitors annually. We link detailed local climate data to a lengthy demographic record, and combine both with a population-wide assessment of recent plant mortality and recruitment, to show that after decades of strong recovery following successful management, this iconic species has entered a period of substantial climate-associated decline. Mortality has been highest at the lower end of the distributional range, where most silverswords occur, and the strong association of annual population growth rates with patterns of precipitation suggests an increasing frequency of lethal water stress. Local climate data confirm trends toward warmer and drier conditions on the mountain, and signify a bleak outlook for silverswords if these trends continue. The silversword example foreshadows trouble for diversity in other biological hotspots, and illustrates how even well-protected and relatively abundant species may succumb to climate-induced stresses.","parentId":"504632afe4b0241d49d62c17","contacts":[{"name":"Pacific Islands CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Paul D Krushelnycky","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai\u2018i M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Lloyd Loope","oldPartyId":6238,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"lloope@usgs.gov","firstName":"Lloyd","lastName":"Loope","organization":{"displayText":"Kilauea Field Station, PIERC"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"8085729252","streetAddress":{"zip":"96768","country":"US","city":"Makawao","state":"HI","line1":"P.O.

Accuracy of plot abundance values assessed with vegetation maps, satellite imagery, and expert consultation. Ten native and five invasive species of trees, shrubs and ferns were selected based on their potential ecological importance in communities, as well as how much field data was available to analyze for this study.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> For baseline climate condition variables, we used surface temperature and rainfall estimates (30 year baseline period, 1978\u20132007) developed by Giambelluca et al. (2013) with grid cell resolution of 250m. To estimate climate change responses, we used future projected climate variables developed by the International Pacific Research Center through dynamical downscaling of climate changes based on Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 3 (CMIP3) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B for end of century (based on Zhang et al. 2012). Plant species abundance models were developed using four baseline predictors with matching future projected climate variables: 1) simplified pioneer substrate (developed from geology maps by Price et al. (2012)) as a proxy for primary succession; 2) mean annual temperature (bio1); 3) wet season rainfall (bio18); and 4) dry season rainfall (bio19). Environmental variables were resampled to a consistent projection (WGS1984) with 250m grid cell resolution.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> We examined data distribution and data gaps, and correlations between variables were assessed using a Pearson correlation coefficient. To estimate relative importance of predictors, we used species-specific response curves and variable importance plots. Individual model fit was assessed using residuals against fitted values plots, null and residual deviance values, and model comparisons using relative Akaike information criterion (AIC). We examined predictive performance of modeling approaches by first using 10 fold cross-validation then area under the curve (AUC) with an independent evaluation set.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> Final models were built with a continuous second degree polynomial GLM model with second degree polynomial substrate variable removed, and no interactions. We used a 70\/30 (train\/test) random split using an evaluation data set that was independent of the training data, with 20 replicates. Multiple test statistics were used for validating model responses and a strong assessment of model performance. For final models in baseline climate conditions, we used AUC and Spearman rank correlation coefficient (\u03c1) values.&quot;","parentId":"5046314fe4b0241d49d62c06","contacts":[{"name":"USGS - Pacific Islands Climate Science Center","type":"Data Owner","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"96718","city":"Hawaii National Park","state":"Hawaii","line1":"PO Box 44 c\/o USGS-KFS"}}},{"name":"James D Jacobi","oldPartyId":4974,"type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jjacobi@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Botanist (Research)","firstName":"James","middleName":"D","lastName":"Jacobi","organization":{"displayText":"Kilauea Field Station, PIERC"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8089678568","officePhone":"8089856411","streetAddress":{"zip":"96813","city":"Honolulu","state":"HI","line1":"677 Ala Moana Blvd"},"buildingCode":"WHD","name":"James D Jacobi\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"96813-5417","country":"USA","city":"Honolulu","state":"HI","line1":"677 Ala Moana Blvd. Suite 615"},"building":"677 Ala Moana"}},{"name":"USGS - Pacific Islands Climate Science Center","type":"Data Owner","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Data"],"browseTypes":["ArcGIS Service Definition","Downloadable","ArcGIS REST Map Service","Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Downloadable","Mappable"],"tags":[{"name":"climate change"},{"name":"PICSC"},{"name":"CSCs"},{"name":"hawaii"},{"name":"native plants"},{"name":"invasive plants"},{"name":"conservation"}],"dates":[{"type":"Release","dateString":"2015-09-16","label":"Release Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-09-16T14:16:13.254-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-09-16T14:55:54.069-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"boundingBox":{"minY":18.797656391,"minX":-159.834703054,"maxY":22.326877913119,"maxX":-154.567982359},"filePathUsed":"__disk__c8\/6e\/14\/c86e14cab5ee3d09ae93be3af33a19a8de8f86cc","processingState":"success","facetName":"ArcGIS Service Definition","serverType":"","servicePath":"55f9ce0de4b05d6c4e501628","name":"Price_SD.sd","processingMessage":"","files":[{"originalMetadata":true,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":10161777,"dateUploaded":"2015-09-16T20:40:58.000Z","name":"Price_SD.sd","pathOnDisk":"__disk__c8\/6e\/14\/c86e14cab5ee3d09ae93be3af33a19a8de8f86cc","title":"ESRI service definition","contentType":"x-gis\/x-arcgis-service-def","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55f9ce0de4b05d6c4e501628?f=__disk__c8%2F6e%2F14%2Fc86e14cab5ee3d09ae93be3af33a19a8de8f86cc"},{"imageWidth":200,"size":5205,"dateUploaded":"2015-09-16T20:41:12.000Z","name":"thumbnail.png","pathOnDisk":"__disk__d1\/e0\/15\/d1e0157bb66b8ae89f7be7a78a7600a55d700341","contentType":"image\/png","imageHeight":133,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55f9ce0de4b05d6c4e501628?f=__disk__d1%2Fe0%2F15%2Fd1e0157bb66b8ae89f7be7a78a7600a55d700341"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ServiceDefinitionFacet","enabledServices":["KmlServer","WMSServer"],"serviceId":"55f9ce0de4b05d6c4e501628"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/arcgis\/rest\/services\/Catalog\/55f9ce0de4b05d6c4e501628\/MapServer","title":"ArcGIS REST Service","type":"serviceLink","typeLabel":"Service Link","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/55f9ce0de4b05d6c4e501628?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/55f9ce0de4b05d6c4e501628?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55f9ce0de4b05d6c4e501628","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"Climate_Change_.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Pacific Islands CSC","parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48","people":["USGS - Pacific Islands Climate Science Center","James D Jacobi"],"orgs":["USGS - Pacific Islands Climate Science Center"]},"559afce2e4b0b94a64016ffe":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"559afce2e4b0b94a64016ffe","title":"Cloud Water Interception in Hawai\u2018i: Building Spatial Pattern Maps for the Present-day Climate and Projected Changes by the Later 21st Century using the Hawai\u2019i Regional Climate Model","body":"Clouds often come in contact with vegetation (often named fogs) within a certain elevation range on Hawai\u2018i\u2019s mountains. Propelled by strong winds, cloud droplets are driven onto the stems and leaves of plants where they are deposited. Some of the water that accumulates on the plants in this way drips to the ground, adding additional water over and above the water supplied by rainfall. Prior observations show that the amount of cloud water intercepted by vegetation is substantial, but also quite variable from place to place. It is, therefore, important to create a map for the complex spatial patterns of cloud water interception (CWI) in Hawai\u2018i. In this project, we propose to create the CWI map at 0.8-km resolution based on the 20-year present-day climate simulations using the Hawai\u2019i Regional Climate Model (HRCM) equipped with a well-tested fog deposition scheme. The map will be verified against measurements at five representative observational sites across the Hawaiian&nbsp;Islands. We will also assess the projected changes in the CWI patterns in Hawai\u2019i by the later 21st century under both weak and strong global warming scenarios.","parentId":"5501c1b2e4b088b2d50c5c0a","contacts":[{"name":"Yuqing Wang","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawaii Manoa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Chunxi Zhang","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pacific Islands CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Pacific Islands CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2015"},{"name":"cloud droplets"},{"name":"fog"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2015-10-01","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2017-09-30","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-07-06T16:10:42.708-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-09-23T15:40:10.391-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Type","value":"Grant"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Number","value":"G15AP00166"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":191582,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":100705},{"year":"2016","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":90877}]}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=559afce2e4b0b94a64016ffe&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=559afce2e4b0b94a64016ffe&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=559afce2e4b0b94a64016ffe&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=559afce2e4b0b94a64016ffe","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/559afce2e4b0b94a64016ffe\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""}],"csc":"Pacific Islands CSC","parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Yuqing Wang","Chunxi Zhang"],"orgs":["Pacific Islands CSC"],"funding_years":"2015","fy":"2015"},"559afca9e4b0b94a64016ff9":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"559afca9e4b0b94a64016ff9","title":"Cloud Water Interception in Hawai\u2018i: Developing Capacity to Characterize the Spatial Patterns and Effects on Water and Ecological Processes","body":"On Hawai\u2018i\u2019s mountains, cloud droplets, propelled by strong winds, are deposited on plants, where they accumulate and drip to the ground, adding water over and above that supplied by rainfall. Prior studies show that the amount of intercepted cloud water is substantial, and variable from place to place. Estimates of the spatial patterns of cloud water interception ( <em>CWI<\/em>), the fog--\u2010related effects on plants, and the contributions of fog to groundwater recharge and surface water flows are needed to better understand the water cycle and predict effects of climate change on water supply and ecosystems.

We will test a model to estimate <em>CWI <\/em>as a function of fog--\u2010water movement and vegetation characteristics. This study will also support two companion projects.

We define coral reef resilience as the capacity of a reef to resist and\/or recover from disturbance given its probable exposure regime, and maintain provision of ecosystem goods and services. Spatial variation in exposure to disturbance and the resilience of reefs in the face of those disturbances will determine the fate of coral reefs within management jurisdictions. This project sought to: (1) undertake ecological resilience assessments in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), which is in the west Pacific near Guam, and (2) collaboratively develop a decision-support framework with local manager partners for resilience-based management. Between 2012 and 2014, our team surveyed 78 sites along the 30-foot contour of the fringing reefs surrounding the most populated islands in CNMI: Saipan, Tinian\/Aguijan, and Rota. These surveys, and complementary analyses using data from environmental monitoring satellites and computer models, included measurements and assessments of variables that are \u2018indicators\u2019 of the processes that underlie reef resilience (e.g., recruitment of new corals and the control of macroalgae on reefs by herbivory). The final results are scores for relative resilience potential that resulted in our ranking the survey sites within and among the islands from high to low resilience. We also assessed two proxies of anthropogenic stress: land-based sources of pollution (e.g., nutrients and sediments) and accessibility due to wave exposure (e.g., fishing access). We found resilience potential to vary greatly within and among islands and set seven custom criteria within a decision-support framework that identifies sites that warrant management attention. This project represents globally relevant progress in the novel approach of using resilience assessments to inform management decision-making. Uniquely, the project was highly collaborative, undertaken with local managers in CNMI who are using the results to inform resilience-based management and management planning.<\/div>\n","parentId":"526964d6e4b0584cbe9168d9","contacts":[{"name":"Laurie Raymundo","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"maynardmarine@gmail.com","organization":{"displayText":"Marine Laboratory, University of Guam"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"(671) 735-2184","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"96923","country":"USA","city":"Mangilao","state":"Guam","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"Jeffrey Maynard","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Marine Applied Research Center, Wilmington, NC"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Steven McKagan","type":"Co-Investigator","organization":{"displayText":"NOAA Fisheries in Saipan, CNMI"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Steven Johnson","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from FPPS data from 1992 through 2009.","firstName":"Steven","middleName":"M","lastName":"Johnson","organization":{"displayText":"CNMI Bureau of Environmental and Coastal Quality"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pacific Islands CSC","oldPartyId":59614,"type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Data","Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Pacific Islands CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2013"},{"name":"Coral Reef Resilience"},{"name":"Vulnerability"},{"name":"Management"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2013-09-30","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2014-12-01","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-08-22T12:56:00.655-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-29T13:57:40.547-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"Completed","facetName":"Project","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":81175,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2013","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":81175},{"_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":0},{"_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":0}]}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":745935,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-02-24T22:21:25.000Z","name":"CNMI resilience data delivery_Raymundo and Maynard_FINAL.xlsx","pathOnDisk":"__disk__8a\/6e\/63\/8a6e63acaf1c17b2a6cf0a5cb4322c4a37a3be82","title":"EXCEL file of inputs and output","contentType":"application\/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/52165ec0e4b0b45d6ba39122?f=__disk__8a%2F6e%2F63%2F8a6e63acaf1c17b2a6cf0a5cb4322c4a37a3be82"},{"imageWidth":1888,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":827642,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2016-05-31T11:26:12.000Z","name":"PI-2013-1_Coral_NWHawaiianIslands_NOAA.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__0f\/ce\/be\/0fcebe1d80d25f5805aabe8c6e084167ed74b30f","title":"Coral in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands -

Even small rainfalls create visible plumes over a few hours. Sediment affects coastal user enjoyment by deteriorating both ecosystem quality and visibility. Sources of erosion include unimproved roads, fallow and active agricultural fields, disturbed forests, local development, and streambanks. This is the primary output dataset from this project, which mapped bank erosion hotspots, constructed a reconnaissance sediment budget for the West Maui watersheds, and constructed a calibrated decision-support model capable of estimating sediment reduction from management actions.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nMapping, field experiments, and analysis of recent and historic rainfall were used to estimate sources of land-based pollution for watersheds in West Maui, Hawaii, and UH translated these findings into a calibrated Bayesian Belief Network Model that estimates spatially explicit erosion under a range of scenarios and management alternatives.&nbsp; An overall sediment budget was constructed for the watersheds, describing the proportion of sediment coming from each source. A sediment budget (see Dietrich and Dunne, 1978) is a table of sediment loads, typically arranged by geomorphic process, enabling users to focus mitigation on sediment sources about which they expect to be most concerned. &nbsp;Findings from this field assessment were used to inform a decision-support model. We developed an opinion-based Bayesian Belief model to estimate spatially explicit streambank erosion from rainfall events. The model can estimate sediment reduction from implementing specific management measures, such as pig removal and repairing stream crossings. This dataset supplies all the inputs to, and outputs from that model.","parentId":"559eb324e4b0b94a64018fdf","contacts":[{"name":"Kirsten Oleson","oldPartyId":64686,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","onlineResource":"http:\/\/olesonlab.org\/","email":"koleson@hawaii.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Kirsten","lastName":"Oleson","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Megan  Barnes","oldPartyId":71968,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","onlineResource":"https:\/\/mdbarnes.wordpress.com\/","email":"m.barnes4@uq.edu.au","active":true,"firstName":"Megan","lastName":"Barnes","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Data"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"dates":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-11-07T19:12:20.064-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-12-06T16:16:39.018-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":6581583,"useForPreview":false,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"ed07dd7af6ea3e092e6d4bbdd33a16fc"},"dateUploaded":"2016-11-08T02:14:40.000Z","name":"Data for Mapping and Environmental Science to Support Clean Reefs of West Maui, Hawai'i.zip","pathOnDisk":"__disk__db\/1d\/30\/db1d3037d6e48212ad1091bc15d21bde541da58e","title":"Datasets and metadata","contentType":"application\/zip","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/58213484e4b08f3b91767f13?f=__disk__db%2F1d%2F30%2Fdb1d3037d6e48212ad1091bc15d21bde541da58e"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/58213484e4b08f3b91767f13?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/58213484e4b08f3b91767f13?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/58213484e4b08f3b91767f13","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"DataforMappinga.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Pacific Islands CSC","parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48","people":["Kirsten Oleson","Megan  Barnes"]},"58798cb0e4b0847d353f4056":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"58798cb0e4b0847d353f4056","title":"DEM Hillshade of Kauai","body":"Hill shades derived from NOAA 3 m coastal DEMs.&nbsp;Derived using Global Mapper (Blue Marble Software, Inc.).

Statistical models were developed to estimate surface-water availability during low-flow conditions for varying rainfall conditions. Results of this study include a spatial understanding of changes in low flows and usable stream habitat on Maui for a range of projected rainfall conditions for the late 21st century. This analysis indicates that stream responses to rainfall vary spatially in Hawai\u2018i. For example, a 10-percent decrease in rainfall may result in a 7% decrease in low flows in West Maui streams, compared to a 20-percent decrease in low flows in East Maui streams. The simple models developed for this study are appropriate for regional climate-change impact assessments given the available data and uncertainty in climate projections. The methods developed for this study are transferable to other Pacific islands as well as continental settings.","purpose":"Researchers for this study will develop statistical methods to assess the impacts of climate change on natural low-flow duration discharges of streams on the main Hawaiian Islands using available high-resolution projected climate information from the International Pacific Research Center (IPRC). The objectives of this study are to (1) estimate baseline and future low-flow characteristics of ungaged streams in Hawai`i, and (2) quantify changes in physical habitat for native stream fauna associated with projected changes in low flows. To accomplish these objectives, this study will (1) compute baseline low-flow duration discharges for gaged sites, (2) develop regional regression models to estimate low-flow duration discharges at ungaged sites for baseline conditions, and (3) evaluate the applicability of the regional regression models to estimate low-flow duration discharges for future conditions. The results of this study will provide critical information for managing Hawai`i's limited freshwater resources, and for understanding how climate change may impact ecosystems, agriculture, and communities that are entirely dependent on freshwater. The study will produce a tool needed by water-resource managers for estimating baseline and future natural low flows.

The information currently available to stakeholders, however, is primarily confined to maximum or mean water level and does not include how often incursions are likely to occur. We propose to quantify the effect of local factors and Pacific climate variability on the frequency of inundation events in centers of population and infrastructure in Pacific island communities. We will produce seasonal outlooks that project the number of incursions above a given level at a particular site in 3-6 month windows. We choose seasonal outlooks, because inundation events tend to cluster seasonally based on coastline orientation, storm tracks, dominant swell direction, and tidal amplitude. These same principles will then be applied to quantify how often severe inundation seasons are likely to occur given longer term changes related to natural and anthropogenic climate change.<\/div>\n","parentId":"5501c1b2e4b088b2d50c5c0a","contacts":[{"name":"Philip  Thompson","oldPartyId":67690,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"philiprt@hawaii.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Thompson","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Matthew J.

These problems will likely worsen with increased sea level rise (SLR). We forecast future coastal change by combining historical shoreline trends with projected accelerations in SLR ( \n<a href=\"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/search?dc.title=IPCC&amp;facet-content-type=ReferenceWorkEntry&amp;sortOrder=relevance\">IPCC<\/a>&nbsp;RCP8.5) using the Davidson-Arnott profile model. The resulting erosion hazard zones are overlain on aerial photos and other GIS layers to provide a tool for identifying assets exposed to future coastal erosion. We estimate rates and distances of shoreline change for ten study sites across the Hawaiian Islands. Excluding one beach (Kailua) historically dominated by accretion, approximately 92 and 96&nbsp;% of the shorelines studied are projected to retreat by 2050 and 2100, respectively. Most projections (~80&nbsp;%) range between 1 - 24&nbsp;m of landward movement by 2050 (relative to 2005) and 4 - 60&nbsp;m by 2100, except at Kailua which is projected to begin receding around 2050. Compared to projections based only on historical extrapolation, those that include accelerated SLR have an average 5.4&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.4&nbsp;m (&plusmn;standard deviation of the average) of additional shoreline recession by 2050 and 18.7&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;m of additional recession by 2100. Due to increasing SLR, the average shoreline recession by 2050 is nearly twice the historical extrapolation, and by 2100 it is nearly 2.5 times the historical extrapolation. Our approach accounts for accretion and long-term sediment processes (based on historical trends) in projecting future shoreline position. However, it does not incorporate potential future changes in nearshore hydrodynamics associated with accelerated SLR.","parentId":"537cca5ce4b00e1e1a484abf","contacts":[{"name":"Tiffany R.

Part I: Present Day","body":"<p>Hawaii\u2019s high and steep topography leads to pronounced small-scale variations in climate, and this makes comprehensive modeling of the weather and climate particularly challenging. This paper describes a regional model formulation designed for simulations of the microclimates in Hawaii and then documents and analyzes an extended retrospective simulation for near-present-day conditions. Part II will apply the model to projected climate conditions near the end of the present century.<\/p> \n<p>A nested version of the Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with fine horizontal resolution and improved physics for the Hawaiian region has been configured. A 20-yr triply nested simulation of the atmospheric flow was undertaken with a 3-km-resolution mesh covering all main Hawaiian Islands and a 1-km mesh over Maui. Ocean surface temperatures are prescribed from observations, and meteorological fields at the boundaries of the outermost domain are taken from global reanalyses. The simulations are compared to surface, balloon, and satellite observations over the same period. The 3-km version of the model realistically simulates the frequency of trade wind inversions, time-mean rainfall, and other variables on relatively small scales over the island of Hawaii. There is a reasonable agreement between observed and simulated mean rainfall patterns over the other islands as well. However, the simulated distribution of mean rainfall over Kauai and (most particularly) Maui and Oahu reveals some significant deficiencies, which is attributed to inadequate resolution of the topography on these islands. The 1-km simulation over Maui shows clear improvement in the mean rainfall over the 3-km version.<\/p>","parentId":"50462d52e4b0241d49d62bea","linkParentIds":["522e2426e4b065b29d2812f5"],"contacts":[{"name":"Chunxi Zhang","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"International Pacific Research Center, University of Hawai'i at Manoa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Yuqing Wang","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"yuqing@hawaii.edu","organization":{"displayText":"International Pacific Research Center, University of Hawai'i at Manoa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Kevin Hamilton","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"International Pacific Research Center, University of Hawai'i at Manoa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Axel Lauer","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"DLR Institute of Atmospheric Physics"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pacific Islands CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","aliases":["Pacific Islands CSC","PICSC"],"fbmsCodes":["GGHCEN0508"],"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"Pacific Islands Climate Science Center - Location","mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/journals.ametsoc.org\/doi\/10.1175\/JCLI-D-15-0432.1","title":"Zhang et al. 2016","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Dynamical Downscaling"},{"name":"Hawai'i"},{"name":"Microclimate"},{"name":"Rainfall"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2016-04-15","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-05-24T11:07:11.253-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-05-24T11:42:12.858-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"American Meteorological Society","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1175\/JCLI-D-15-0432.1"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Pacific Islands CSC","parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48","people":["Chunxi Zhang","Yuqing Wang","Kevin Hamilton","Axel Lauer"],"orgs":["Pacific Islands CSC"]},"580f8424e4b0f497e795ffe1":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"580f8424e4b0f497e795ffe1","title":"Effects of Drought on Soil Moisture and Water Resources in Hawai\u2018i","body":"<div>Droughts in the Hawaiian Islands can enhance wildfire risk, diminish freshwater resources, and devastate threatened and endangered species on land and in nearshore ecosystems.

During periods of drought, cloud-water interception in Hawai\u2018i\u2019s rain forests, also known as fog drip, may play an important role in providing moisture for plants, reducing wildfire risk within the fog zone, and contributing to groundwater recharge that sustains flow in streams during dry periods. Estimates of changes in groundwater recharge, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration during periods of drought are critical to Hawai\u2018i\u2019s water managers, planners, agriculturists, ranchers, and forest, watershed, and wildfire managers for developing adaptive management strategies.\n\nThis study addresses a specific need to collect information that will lead to a better understanding of the hydrologic impacts of drought throughout the State of Hawai\u2018i. Specific objectives of the study are (1) to estimate changes in soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge during periods of drought for current and future climate conditions, and (2) to estimate the combined impact of drought and reduced fog drip on soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge. The proposed study area covers the islands of Hawai\u2018i, Kaua\u2018i, Maui, Moloka\u2018i, and O\u2018ahu.\n\nTo accomplish the study objectives, the following five tasks will be implemented: (1) soil-moisture data compilation, (2) plot-scale recharge-rate estimation using available data, (3) regional water-budget modeling, (4) report and geospatial dataset preparation, and (5) stakeholder engagement. The methods and results of this study will be documented in a USGS Scientific Investigations Report. Geospatial datasets of soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge for current and future climate conditions will be prepared and made publicly available. The study will start in September 2016 and take about three years to complete.\n\nThe results from this study will inform resource managers of the potential impacts of climate change on water resources and the importance of fog drip in mitigating the impacts of drought, and provide needed input for supporting science-based strategies for managing critical recharge areas and identifying areas vulnerable to wildfires.

This data will be combined with an engineering model that predicts shoreline erosion with SLR but neglects to account for the role of sediment availability in modulating shoreline position. Under assumed scenarios of SLR a hybrid model will be used that integrates the historical shoreline trends with future (engineering model-based) projections. Although simple in concept, this approach has never been tried before. This study will develop an easily transferable methodology and planning tool that can form the basis of a climate-ready strategy of beach management. Using data and maps produced by the project, decision-makers will be able to prioritize beach conservation efforts, screen permit applications, identify potential future impacts, and increase the resiliency of the current management network of decision-making. By planning for future beach response to SLR, this project will allow for the existing decision-making system to evolve new strategies focused on adaptation to future SLR.<\/div>\n","parentId":"5362adade4b0c409c6289bab","contacts":[{"name":"Charles Fletcher","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai`i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Tiffany Anderson","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai`i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Matt Barbee","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai`i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Sam Lemmo","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Hawai`i Department of Land and Natural Resources"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Brad Romine","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai`i at M\u0101noa Sea Grant"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Mike Dahilig","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Kauai Planning"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jesse Souki","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Hawai`i Office of Planning"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pacific Islands CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Label","name":"beach"},{"type":"Label","name":"erosion"},{"type":"Label","name":"model"},{"type":"Label","name":"sea-level rise"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Pacific Islands CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-09-01","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2016-08-31","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-05-21T09:44:54.729-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-29T13:47:43.639-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Grant Award Number","value":"G14AP00179"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":0}],"files":[{"imageWidth":962,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":1319068,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2016-01-28T14:28:32.000Z","name":"PI-2014-4_NorthShore_erosion_DolanEversole.png","pathOnDisk":"__disk__64\/5c\/7e\/645c7e9cf4dc7da31b0fbf3744e0fb8b90ca536c","title":"Erosion on the North Shore -

External threats such as invasive species and landscape characteristics such as isolation may impinge on both pollination and seed predation dynamics, which in turn can strongly affect reproduction. I assessed how patterns in floral visitation, seed predation, invasive ant presence, and plant isolation influenced one another and ultimately affected viable seed production in Haleakal\u0101 silverswords (<em>Argyroxiphium sandwicense<\/em>&nbsp;subsp.&nbsp;<em>macrocephalum<\/em>) of Hawai\u2019i. Floral visitation was dominated by endemic&nbsp;<em>Hylaeus<\/em>&nbsp;bees, and patterns of visitation were influenced by floral display size and number of plants clustered together, but not by floral herbivory or nearest flowering neighbor distance. There was also some indication that Argentine ant presence impacted floral visitation, but contradictory evidence and limitations of the study design make this result uncertain. Degree of seed predation was associated only with plant isolation, with the two main herbivores partitioning resources such that one preferentially attacked isolated plants while the other attacked clumped plants; total seed predation was greater in more isolated plants. Net viable seed production was highly variable among individuals (0\u201355% seed set), and was affected mainly by nearest neighbor distance, apparently owing to low cross-pollination among plants separated by even short distances (&gt;10\u201320 m). This isolation effect dominated net seed set, with no apparent influence from floral visitation rates, percent seed predation, or invasive ant presence. The measured steep decline in seed set with isolation distance may not be typical of the entire silversword range, and may indicate that pollinators in addition to&nbsp;<em>Hylaeus<\/em>&nbsp;bees could be important for greater gene flow. Management aimed at maintaining or maximizing silversword reproduction should focus on the spatial context of field populations and outplanting efforts, as well as on conserving the widest possible range of pollinator taxa.","parentId":"504632afe4b0241d49d62c17","contacts":[{"name":"Paul D.

In addition to these threats global climate change is expected to increase temperature and alter patterns of precipitation in Hawaii. This project models the relative vulnerability of native plant species to the effects of climate change, in order to assist resource managers in effectively allocating limited resources to efficiently preserve and protect current and future habitat for native plants.<br>\n<br>\nWe modeled vulnerability by creating an expert system \u2013 a network model linking biological traits of various plant species with the projected changes in species ranges under the effect of climate change. A panel of experts in Hawaiian plant species participated in the model design, identifying factors expected to affect a species\u2019 ability to successfully respond to climate change. Once the model results were available, this same panel verified that the model results agreed with their own expert opinion on a sample of species with which they were familiar.<br>\n<br>\nThe results are relative vulnerability scores for 1,056 native Hawaiian plant species. Due to limitations of the modeling process and the available data, the exact vulnerability scores are less important than the general ranking, and can be used to identify categories of species with high, middle, and low vulnerability to climate change.<\/div>\n","purpose":"As global climate change continues to impact Pacific Islands, the need for local and regional adaptation has made vulnerability assessments increasingly useful decision-making tools for resource managers. A vulnerability assessment can help resource managers prioritize conservation actions and guide climate change adaptation. In collaboration with research and management partners from federal, state and non-profit organizations, project researchers have devised a flexible species vulnerability approach that can be easily updated with improved data and thus better fits the Pacific reality of often limited and uncertain information. Recently the completion of their first species vulnerability assessment showed that the researchers can use their novel model approach to assess the vulnerability of each individual native Hawaiian plant species to climate change (1086 species). However, given some shortcomings of the original approach the team proposes to make substantial expansion and improvements in their assessment efforts to comprehensively consider the full range of species responses to climate change and thus fill a critical knowledge gap defined by natural resource scientists and managers in the region.

Haleakal\u0101 Silversword to Uncover the Effects of Climate Change on Hawai\u02c8i\u2019s High-Elevation Ecosystems\"","body":"Climate change is expected to cause many plant and animal species to migrate, and others to decline or go extinct if they can\u2019t move sufficiently to keep up with changing conditions. Mountain-top species are thought to be especially vulnerable because they have limited potential to make such shifts. The Haleakala silversword, also known as ahinahina, occurs near the top of Haleakala volcano on the island of Maui, Hawaii, and is an ideal species with which to investigate plant responses to changing climate conditions. Long-term monitoring data allowed us to determine that the population has undergone a decline of approximately 60% in recent decades, and that this has corresponded to drier conditions that have developed on the mountain. A population model constructed with these data led to predictions of a high risk of extinction, over the next century, for most of the population if recent demographic trends continue. The likelihood that these trends will continue depends in large part on future rainfall patterns on the mountain, which at this stage are uncertain. Given this uncertainty, it seems prudent to plan for warmer and drier climate scenarios. Our investigations into the factors that influence silversword seedling drought tolerance suggest that some genetic differences among sub-populations may exist, but that more variation arises from the conditions that seedlings experience during development. Differences in weather and climate conditions across the plant\u2019s range also appear to contribute to patterns of seedling survival after outplanting. These findings have led to subsequent work in collaboration with land managers at Haleakala National Park, in which survival rates will be monitored in outplanting plots across wider environmental gradients. These include wetter areas of the park where silverswords grew in the past, and where they may be better able to withstand warmer and drier conditions in the future.&nbsp;","parentId":"504632afe4b0241d49d62c17","contacts":[{"name":"Paul D.

Statistical models were developed to estimate surface-water availability during low-flow conditions for varying rainfall conditions. Results of this study include a spatial understanding of changes in low flows and usable stream habitat on Maui for a range of projected rainfall conditions for the late 21st century. This analysis indicates that stream responses to rainfall vary spatially in Hawai\u2018i. For example, a 10-percent decrease in rainfall may result in a 7% decrease in low flows in West Maui streams, compared to a 20-percent decrease in low flows in East Maui streams. The simple models developed for this study are appropriate for regional climate-change impact assessments given the available data and uncertainty in climate projections. The methods developed for this study are transferable to other Pacific islands as well as continental settings.","parentId":"5362ae15e4b0c409c6289bb7","contacts":[{"name":"Maoya Bassiouni","oldPartyId":14518,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"mbassiou@usgs.gov","jobTitle":"Hydrologist","firstName":"Maoya","lastName":"Bassiouni","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Pacific Islands Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8086909599","officePhone":"8086909595","streetAddress":{"zip":"96818","country":"US","city":"Honolulu","state":"HI","line1":"1845 Wasp Boulevard, Bld 176"},"buildingCode":"WFI","name":"Maoya Bassiouni\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"96813-5415","country":"USA","city":"Honolulu","line1":"677 Ala Moana Blvd. Suite 415"},"building":"Daniel K.

There are, currently, no practical methods for estimating the spatial extent of erosion hazard, despite the fact that increased sea level rise (SLR) over the current century is likely to contribute toward more land being exposed to future erosion. This study creates a new model which provides estimates of exposure to erosion on a local geographic scale. This new method is a valuable tool for the coastal community because of its ease of implementation and because it uses historical shoreline trends, information that is widely available.<br>\n<br>\nThis study applies the new model to all sandy shorelines of the Hawaiian Island of Kauai. Application to an entire island serves to: 1) ensure that the model can be successfully applied to diverse geologic and wave settings; and 2) provide erosion hazard projections for improved coastal management both for Kauai County and as part of the Hawaii legislatively-mandated Act 83, which requires the creation of the Interagency Climate Adaptation Committee (ICAC) tasked with creating a climate adaptation report on the impacts of SLR.<br>\nModeled erosion hazard areas are graphically presented in map form to identify areas that are vulnerable to erosion and which can be used to improve the decision-making process in coastal management. The probability of future exposure to erosion is shown as geographic information system (GIS) layers. These layers are incorporated into an online tool that displays erosion hazard layers, along with other SLR-related hazards. The website (http:\/\/www.pacioos.hawaii.edu\/shoreline\/slr-icac\/) is currently password protected while this tool is in draft form; public release is expected at the end of year 2017.<br>\n<br>\nErosion hazard layers for the years 2030, 2050, 2075, and 2100 were created for all sandy shorelines of Kauai Island, Hawaii under the IPCC \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d SLR scenario. Results for Kauai indicate that all four regions of the island (North, East, South, West) will have more areas experiencing coastal retreat, and the rates of retreat will become more intense over the current century. The percent of Kauai shorelines included in the study that show retreat (those with a negative long-term shoreline change trend) increased from 73% historically, to 86% by the year 2050, to 91% by the year 2100. Erosion hazard layers produced by this study will be widely available to government agencies and the general public, and will be essential in assessing vulnerability to erosion with increased SLR.","parentId":"537cca5ce4b00e1e1a484abf","contacts":[{"name":"Charles Fletcher","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai`i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"sea level rise"},{"name":"coastal"}],"dates":[{"type":"Collected","dateString":"2016-11-21","label":"Date Collected"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2017-01-11T15:55:23.419-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2017-01-11T15:55:23.419-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Final Report","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":723170,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"5211fec61404e5f5a16b2ee168efd7b3"},"dateUploaded":"2017-01-11T22:55:16.000Z","name":"PICSC Final Report Fletcher Hawaii_SLR 2016 12 01.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__ca\/cf\/69\/cacf6939f8602f5f6aceacf348e95a70fd25aecd","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5876b7dbe4b0aa226e1c4bb1?f=__disk__ca%2Fcf%2F69%2Fcacf6939f8602f5f6aceacf348e95a70fd25aecd"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5876b7dbe4b0aa226e1c4bb1","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalProjectRep.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Pacific Islands CSC","parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48","people":["Charles Fletcher"]},"5876bda2e4b0aa226e1c731c":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/52165f2ce4b0b45d6ba395e9","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Final Project Report for \"Expanding a Dynamic Model of Species Vulnerability to Climate Change for Hawai`i and Other Pacific Island Ecosystems\"","relatedTitle":"Expanding a Dynamic Model of Species Vulnerability to Climate Change for Hawai`i and Other Pacific Island Ecosystems","id":"5876bda2e4b0aa226e1c731c","relatedId":"52165f2ce4b0b45d6ba395e9","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5876bda2e4b0aa226e1c731c","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Expanding a Dynamic Model of Species Vulnerability to Climate Change for Hawai`i and Other Pacific Island Ecosystems","relatedTitle":"Final Project Report for \"Expanding a Dynamic Model of Species Vulnerability to Climate Change for Hawai`i and Other Pacific Island Ecosystems\"","id":"52165f2ce4b0b45d6ba395e9","relatedId":"5876bda2e4b0aa226e1c731c","annotation":null}]},"id":"5876bda2e4b0aa226e1c731c","title":"Final Project Report for \"Expanding a Dynamic Model of Species Vulnerability to Climate Change for Hawai`i and Other Pacific Island Ecosystems\"","body":"The Hawaiian Islands are home to a variety of native species that have been subject to numerous threats including development of habitat for human use, predation by introduced herbivores, and competition with invasive plant species.

Through our interviews with respected ocean users we learned the difficulties and potential of mapping ocean currents and ocean use areas and how these ocean experts have perceived change in the environment. In Hilo Hawai\u02bbi, we interviewed ocean experts (people recommended for the ocean knowledge), and surfers of all ages and experience at Honoli\u02bbi. We also collected physical environmental data for Hilo Bay and ocean user presence counts for beaches within this County. Understanding the dynamics of the seascape in a manner that supports management decision-making requires us to understand the complex interactions between human, biological, and physical processes. We mapped the changes in oceanic conditions through time as monitored by environmental sensors and the perception of this change as reflected in personal interactions with a site through time. Changes in the environment cannot be perceived only through the measurement of single variables, but must be placed within a social context of complex changes. Through the interviews we can see a pattern of seacape delineation, scales of interactions, and personal connections with the ocean. Ocean experts\u2019 spatial observations are determined by their activities on the ocean as well as ecological boundaries. Change over time in a specific place is defined by biological and physical changes, external social pressures, and individual reflections, preventing ocean observers from specifically identifying the effects of climate change yet allowing their connection to place to continue. Exposing managers to the application of alternative data sources and particularly human perceptions expands the ability of managers to align discussions around scales relevant for ocean users.","parentId":"53b1c03fe4b0c9da2f80a567","contacts":[{"name":"Noelani  Puniwai","oldPartyId":66273,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"npuniwai@hawaii.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Noelani","lastName":"Puniwai","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Capacity Building"},{"name":"Coastal"}],"dates":[{"type":"Collected","dateString":"2016-09-30","label":"Date Collected"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2017-01-11T17:53:13.829-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2017-01-11T19:25:05.475-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Final Report","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":524710,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"11a25cd893db9e8f0f70565a70d8ae55"},"dateUploaded":"2017-01-12T02:25:01.000Z","name":"PICSC Final Report Puniwai Hamakua_Seascapes 2016 11 30.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__c8\/11\/04\/c811048ee50aa8a7307c64df91ad692894114fac","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5876d379e4b0aa226e1cdd9b?f=__disk__c8%2F11%2F04%2Fc811048ee50aa8a7307c64df91ad692894114fac"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5876d379e4b0aa226e1cdd9b","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalProjectRep.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Pacific Islands CSC","parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48","people":["Noelani  Puniwai"]},"5876c02de4b0aa226e1c8143":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/52165eede4b0b45d6ba39312","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Final Project Report for \"Understanding the Response of Native and Non\u2010native Forests to Climate Variability and Change to Support Resource Management in Hawai`i\"","relatedTitle":"Understanding the Response of Native and Non\u2010native Forests to Climate Variability and Change to Support Resource Management in Hawai`i","id":"5876c02de4b0aa226e1c8143","relatedId":"52165eede4b0b45d6ba39312","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5876c02de4b0aa226e1c8143","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Understanding the Response of Native and Non\u2010native Forests to Climate Variability and Change to Support Resource Management in Hawai`i","relatedTitle":"Final Project Report for \"Understanding the Response of Native and Non\u2010native Forests to Climate Variability and Change to Support Resource Management in Hawai`i\"","id":"52165eede4b0b45d6ba39312","relatedId":"5876c02de4b0aa226e1c8143","annotation":null}]},"id":"5876c02de4b0aa226e1c8143","title":"Final Project Report for \"Understanding the Response of Native and Non\u2010native Forests to Climate Variability and Change to Support Resource Management in Hawai`i\"","body":"One of the biggest concerns about global climate change impacts relates to how forests and other ecosystems will be affected. Along with increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and warming temperatures, rainfall, cloud cover, storm frequency, and other aspects of climate will also change. These shifts are likely to have effects on plants, such as changing the amount of water they use or how fast they grow. In this project, we investigated the connections between environmental conditions (such as temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, humidity, wind speed, soil moisture) and plant water use and growth rates of two forest ecosystems in Hawai\u2018i. Based on those connections, we sought to project how a specific set of possible future climate changes will affect water use and growth of these forests. The forests chosen for study represent relatively undisturbed native forest and a forest that has been invaded by the non-native tree strawberry guava. As a result of this study, we have found that more water is used at the non-native forest site, and growth characteristics of the two sites are different. Projections of changes that will be caused by future climate change show that both forests will use more water and will grow more slowly. It appears that both of these effects will be greater for the non-native site, i.e., the water use will increase more for the non-native forest and the growth will be reduced more there. Our findings are important because future increases in forest water use caused by climate change could reduce the availability of groundwater resources and streamflow. Reduced growth rates could affect forest health and stability, which could further curtail the ecosystem services they provide.","parentId":"522e2acae4b065b29d281af4","contacts":[{"name":"Thomas  Giambelluca","oldPartyId":64693,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"thomas@hawaii.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Giambelluca","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Plants"},{"name":"Forests"}],"dates":[{"type":"Collected","dateString":"2016-09-30","label":"Date Collected"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2017-01-11T16:30:53.013-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2017-01-11T16:42:44.345-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Final Report","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":3992633,"useForPreview":false,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"24fc3dbad4de24cc286f50bc3e09d7a5"},"dateUploaded":"2017-01-11T23:30:33.000Z","name":"PICSC Final Report Giambelluca Ohia_Guava_ET 2016 12 05.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__a4\/0d\/d6\/a40dd6d8fa39ffcce216cb252662e9e571b28b5b","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5876c02de4b0aa226e1c8143?f=__disk__a4%2F0d%2Fd6%2Fa40dd6d8fa39ffcce216cb252662e9e571b28b5b"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5876c02de4b0aa226e1c8143","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalProjectRep.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Pacific Islands CSC","parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48","people":["Thomas  Giambelluca"]},"5877a81ce4b0315b4c120025":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/50118f9fe4b0d78fd4e59ba6","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Final Project Report for \"Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change - Using Models to Link Landscape, Climate, Disease, and Potential Adaptation\"","relatedTitle":"Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change - Using Models to Link Landscape, Climate, Disease, and Potential Adaptation","id":"5877a81ce4b0315b4c120025","relatedId":"50118f9fe4b0d78fd4e59ba6","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5877a81ce4b0315b4c120025","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change - Using Models to Link Landscape, Climate, Disease, and Potential Adaptation","relatedTitle":"Final Project Report for \"Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change - Using Models to Link Landscape, Climate, Disease, and Potential Adaptation\"","id":"50118f9fe4b0d78fd4e59ba6","relatedId":"5877a81ce4b0315b4c120025","annotation":null}]},"id":"5877a81ce4b0315b4c120025","title":"Final Project Report for \"Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change - Using Models to Link Landscape, Climate, Disease, and Potential Adaptation\"","body":"The Hawaiian Islands are home to some of the world\u2019s most imperiled forest birds. Introduction of mosquitoes and vector-borne avian malaria are important factors in the historic decline and extinction of many endemic Hawaiian honeycreepers which are particularly susceptible to avian malaria. We used a model of forest birds, mosquitoes, and avian malaria to evaluate future impacts of avian malaria on these Hawaiian birds as a result of climate change. As climate warms during the 21st Century temperatures will favor increased mosquito populations and much higher transmission of malaria to endangered honeycreepers existing in high-elevation forests. We conclude that without significant intervention many native Hawaiian honeycreepers will suffer major population declines and\/or extinction due to this increasing risk from avian malaria. Proposed strategies to mitigate the problem include mosquito population suppression using sterile males or incompatible males, release of mosquitoes which are genetically modified to prevent malaria transmission to birds (e.g., refractory mosquitoes), competition from other introduced mosquitoes, evolved malaria-tolerance in native honeycreepers, feral pig control to reduce mosquito larval habitats, and predator control to improve bird demographics. Because predicted transmission rates of malaria will be higher than currently observed, several conservation strategies including predator removal, competing vectors, and feral pig control were insufficient to maintain these important bird populations at current levels. In contrast, mosquito control strategies offer potential long-term benefits to high-elevation Hawaiian honeycreepers. The predicted higher rate of future disease transmission means that combined strategies will likely be needed to preserve endemic birds at mid elevation. The predicted climate changes are likely to have enormous impacts in high-elevation forests where current low rates of transmission create a refuge for highly-susceptible birds, mitigating malaria transmission should be a primary avian conservation goal. Strategies that maintain highly-susceptible honeycreepers (such as the Iiwi) in high-elevation forests will likely benefit many other endangered Hawaiian birds.","parentId":"50462fabe4b0241d49d62bf9","contacts":[{"name":"Michael D Samuel","oldPartyId":8971,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"msamuel@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Assistant Unit Leader Research Wildlife Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"D","lastName":"Samuel","organization":{"displayText":"Wisconsin Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"6082629922","officePhone":"6082636882","streetAddress":{"zip":"53706","city":"Madison","state":"WI","line1":"U of WI Russel Lab Rm 204"},"buildingCode":"ARJ","name":"Michael D Samuel\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

Since many plants and animals depend on specific types of climate, it is imperative to understand: (1) the details of species\u2019 climatic preferences; (2) how climates may change in the future; and (3) how species may respond to these changes. Species distribution modeling (SDM) is an increasingly important tool to address conservation biology and global change issues. As Fortini and colleagues described in their largest vulnerability assessment in the US, SDMs provide critical information on biological refuges and potential future shifts in species ranges. In addition, climate changes could alter not only range, but abundance and capacity to persist. Whereas explicit spatial habitat models typically project occurrence, here we generate species models of abundance projected in response to environmental predictors.&nbsp;\n<br> \n<br> \u200bThis project gathered together over 35 years of data from thousands of locations in Hawai\u2018i where vegetation was surveyed recording the details of all plant species found at each site. This permitted us to relate characteristics of the vegetation to specific aspects of the climate (in terms of rainfall and temperature, for example) that can be derived from detailed climate maps. We excluded highly invaded plots for the native species models, whereas agricultural and urban areas were included in the modeling to show pre-development scenarios. We focused on ten important native and five important invasive plant species (mostly trees) in order to understand the characteristics of each species\u2019 preferred climatic habitat. Species were selected based on their ecological \u201cimportance\u201d in communities, as well as on how much field data was available to analyze for this study. Colleagues at the University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa, USGS, NOAA, and other agencies were simultaneously researching how climate is changing and producing maps of projected future climate. Using these climate projections, and the relationships we have drawn about each species\u2019 preferences, we produced estimates of where species\u2019 best habitat may be in the future. For native species, this is important because these areas may be key locations to focus conservation efforts, especially since many unique animals depend on native vegetation. For invasive species, these projections provide managers a powerful tool with which to target areas for control before invasive species are able to move into new habitats (and potentially disrupt natural ecosystem processes). To that end, we also examined characteristics of species growth rates and how their fruits\/seeds are dispersed in order to understand how quickly they may be able to respond to changing climates and potentially move into newly emerging habitat. Together, the present and future habitat maps&nbsp;and the ecological characteristics of our focal species provide an initial set of supporting tools for managers and decision makers.&nbsp;","parentId":"5046315ee4b0241d49d62c0c","contacts":[{"name":"Jonathan Price","oldPartyId":15508,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jprice@unr.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Price","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai`i at Hilo"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"James D Jacobi","oldPartyId":4974,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jjacobi@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Botanist (Research)","firstName":"James","middleName":"D","lastName":"Jacobi","organization":{"displayText":"USGS PIERC"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8089678568","officePhone":"8089856411","streetAddress":{"zip":"96813","city":"Honolulu","state":"HI","line1":"677 Ala Moana Blvd"},"buildingCode":"WHD","name":"James D Jacobi\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"96813-5417","country":"USA","city":"Honolulu","state":"HI","line1":"677 Ala Moana Blvd. Suite 615"},"building":"677 Ala Moana"}},{"name":"Tamara Wong","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pacific Islands CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"tags":[{"name":"Vegetation"},{"name":"Hawai'i"},{"name":"species distribution modeling"},{"name":"species abundance"}],"dates":[{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2015-07-29","label":"Date Reported"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-09-03T08:11:55.182-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-20T13:50:15.067-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":528370,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-09-03T14:11:53.000Z","name":"Price_Wong_Jacobi - Species Abundance Modeling Final Report.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__d7\/ec\/2c\/d7ec2cb575ba2fc053113be75a36d274376ca945","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55e8552be4b0dacf699e66bd?f=__disk__d7%2Fec%2F2c%2Fd7ec2cb575ba2fc053113be75a36d274376ca945"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55e8552be4b0dacf699e66bd","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalReportfor_.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Pacific Islands CSC","parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48","people":["Jonathan Price","James D Jacobi","Tamara Wong"],"orgs":["Pacific Islands CSC"]},"54ff26fce4b02419550dec20":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/52165ec0e4b0b45d6ba39122","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Final Report: Coral Reef Resilience to Climate Change in CNMI","relatedTitle":"Coral Reef Resilience to Climate Change in CNMI: Field-based Assessments and Implications for Vulnerability and Future Management","id":"54ff26fce4b02419550dec20","relatedId":"52165ec0e4b0b45d6ba39122","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/54ff26fce4b02419550dec20","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Coral Reef Resilience to Climate Change in CNMI: Field-based Assessments and Implications for Vulnerability and Future Management","relatedTitle":"Final Report: Coral Reef Resilience to Climate Change in CNMI","id":"52165ec0e4b0b45d6ba39122","relatedId":"54ff26fce4b02419550dec20","annotation":null}]},"id":"54ff26fce4b02419550dec20","title":"Final Report: Coral Reef Resilience to Climate Change in CNMI","body":"Reducing coral reef vulnerability to climate change requires that managers understand and support the natural resilience of coral reefs. We define coral reef resilience as: the capacity of a reef to resist and\/or recover from disturbance given its probable exposure regime, and maintain provision of ecosystem goods and services. Spatial variation in exposure to disturbance and the resilience of reefs in the face of those disturbances will determine the fate of coral reefs within management jurisdictions. This project sought to: (1) undertake ecological resilience assessments in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), which is in the west Pacific near Guam, and (2) collaboratively develop a decision-support framework with local manager partners for resilience-based management. Between 2012 and 2014, our team surveyed 78 sites along the 30-foot contour of the fringing reefs surrounding the most populated islands in CNMI: Saipan, Tinian\/Aguijan, and Rota. These surveys, and complementary analyses using data from environmental monitoring satellites and computer models, included measurements and assessments of variables that are \u2018indicators\u2019 of the processes that underlie reef resilience (e.g., recruitment of new corals and the control of macroalgae on reefs by herbivory). The final results are scores for relative resilience potential that resulted in our ranking the survey sites within and among the islands from high to low resilience. We also assessed two proxies of anthropogenic stress: land-based sources of pollution (e.g., nutrients and sediments) and accessibility due to wave exposure (e.g., fishing access). We found resilience potential to vary greatly within and among islands and set set custom criteria within a decision-support framework that identifies sites that warrant management attention. This project represents globally relevant progress in the novel approach of using resilience assessments to inform management decision-making. Uniquely, the project was highly collaborative,&nbsp;\n<span style=\"line-height:16.003px\">undertaken&nbsp;<\/span>with local managers in CNMI who are using the results to inform resilience-based management and management planning.","parentId":"522e2084e4b065b29d2812eb","contacts":[{"name":"Jeff Maynard","oldPartyId":64685,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"maynardmarine@gmail.com","active":true,"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Maynard","organization":{"displayText":"Marine Applied Research Center Wilmington, NC"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Laurie Raymundo","oldPartyId":64684,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"ljraymundo@gmail.com","active":true,"firstName":"Laurie","lastName":"Raymundo","organization":{"displayText":"Marine Laboratory, University of Guam"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"tags":[{"name":"Coral Reef"},{"name":"Climate Change"},{"name":"Mariana Islands"},{"name":"Vulnerability"},{"name":"Resilience"}],"dates":[{"type":"Acquisition","dateString":"2015-02-27","label":"Acquisition"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-03-10T11:16:44.300-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-20T13:42:14.080-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":2937843,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-03-10T17:14:35.000Z","name":"CNMI Resilience_PICSC_Raymundo and Maynard_Final Report_FINAL.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__76\/a0\/e8\/76a0e8940e853c1afd014be9811cd0f3ece4a255","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/54ff26fce4b02419550dec20?f=__disk__76%2Fa0%2Fe8%2F76a0e8940e853c1afd014be9811cd0f3ece4a255"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/54ff26fce4b02419550dec20","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalReport_Cor.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Pacific Islands CSC","parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48","people":["Jeff Maynard","Laurie Raymundo"]},"52165e8ee4b0b45d6ba38f05":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"52165e8ee4b0b45d6ba38f05","title":"Future Coral Reef Community Projections of DOI-Managed Coastal Assets in the Hawaiian Islands","body":"<div>The conditions of coral reefs in the Hawaiian Islands are predicted to decline significantly from climate change over the next 100 years. To better prepare for the impacts of climate change on Hawaiian reefs, the research team uses a system of models to simulate ocean waves and circulation, rainfall and storm run-off, and coral reef community dynamics through the year 2100. These models will identify reef areas that are either vulnerable or resilient to the many stressors that the future may hold for reefs. The team\u2019s hope is that this work can identify areas that might benefit from management actions to minimize local stressors such as land-based pollution.

Implications","body":"<div>The study of seascapes, the area where humans interact with the ocean, and particularly, how people ascribe meaning to their observations, interactions, and relationships to the sea is directly pertinent to the management of our ocean resources. Through our interviews with respected ocean users we learned the difficulties and potential of mapping ocean currents and ocean use areas and how these ocean experts have perceived change in the environment. In Hilo Hawai\u02bbi, we interviewed ocean experts (people recommended for the ocean knowledge), and surfers of all ages and experience at Honoli\u02bbi. We also collected physical environmental data for Hilo Bay and ocean user presence counts for beaches within this County. Understanding the dynamics of the seascape in a manner that supports management decision-making requires us to understand the complex interactions between human, biological, and physical processes. We mapped the changes in oceanic conditions through time as monitored by environmental sensors and the perception of this change as reflected in personal interactions with a site through time. Changes in the environment cannot be perceived only through the measurement of single variables, but must be placed within a social context of complex changes. Through the interviews we can see a pattern of seacape delineation, scales of interactions, and personal connections with the ocean. Ocean experts\u2019 spatial observations are determined by their activities on the ocean as well as ecological boundaries. Change over time in a specific place is defined by biological and physical changes, external social pressures, and individual reflections, preventing ocean observers from specifically identifying the effects of climate change yet allowing their connection to place to continue. Exposing managers to the application of alternative data sources and particularly human perceptions expands the ability of managers to align discussions around scales relevant for ocean users.<\/div>\n","parentId":"5362adade4b0c409c6289bab","contacts":[{"name":"Noelani Puniwai","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pacific Islands CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Pacific Islands CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"},{"name":"Coastal Communities"},{"name":"Resiliency"},{"name":"Culture"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-08-25","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2016-08-24","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-06-30T13:48:27.065-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2017-01-11T17:53:39.613-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"Completed","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"FY 14 Grant","value":"G14AP00176"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":92204,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2014","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":92204}]}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":211610,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-04-14T13:22:10.000Z","name":"Copyright_NoelaniPuniwai.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__21\/6f\/4b\/216f4bee5460bb916ba279ac974a43474b74dec4","title":"Photo release -

These changes can have wide-reaching implications, affecting the water supply, native vegetation and wildlife, wildfire patterns, and the spread of invasive species. Several climate-related factors are influencing Hawai\u02c8i\u2019s landscapes and contributing to these changes. These include climate change, climate variability, and drought (referred to collectively as CCVD). Climate variability describes how the climate fluctuates on a yearly basis around average values, while climate change describes patterns of long-term continuous change in the average.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nWhile it is understood that CCVD will exert a growing influence on Hawai\u02c8i\u2019s ecosystems and communities, there is currently little information on the historic impacts of CCVD in the region. Improving our understanding of past conditions will help Hawai\u02c8i\u2019s natural resource managers better prepare for the future impacts of CCVD on ecosystems and communities. For example, invasive plant species in Hawai\u02c8i tend to be more fire-prone. If CCVD contributes to the spread of invasives, there may be more wildfires, and managers may need to revise current fire management strategies.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThis project will use newly available datasets and tools to improve our understanding of the impacts of historic CCVD in Hawai\u02c8i. This information will then be used to assess the potential ecological and social impacts of CCVD, with an emphasis on fire risk. The results of this study will assist Hawai\u02c8i\u2019s land managers in identifying which actions should be implemented to help prepare ecosystems and communities for future climate conditions. <\/div>","purpose":"Climate change, climate variability and episodic drought (CCVD) will exert a growing influence on Hawaii\u2019s landscapes, watersheds, and near shore areas. Resulting changes will be magnified through interactions among changing climate, an expanding non-native and invasive plant species cover, especially fire prone species, and accelerating spread and enhanced intensity of novel fire regimes, ultimately shifting biome and causing extinctions. We know from past records and occurrences, the interactive effects of CCVD, invasion and fire are self-reinforcing stressors. Initial modeling highlights the potential for continued changes to the climate system in the coming century, but for the Hawaiian Islands, the magnitude and spatial distributions of past CCVD are poorly quantified. As a result, how CCVD will impact local climate, the spread of non-native invasive species, future fire danger, and their interactions is unknown, presenting a complex and intensely interconnected \u201cwicked\u201d problem for Hawaii land managers. In this project, the research team will build on a number of recently developed products and tools to synthesize\/develop high resolution understanding of past CCVD, especially historical trajectories, as well as initial assessment of trends emerging from downscaled current and future drought. We will use this information to assess significance of CCVD to various sectors, with a more detailed assessment of how CCVD related to past fire weather, fuel moisture, and fire danger indices (FDIs, which combine fuels, weather, and fuel moisture).","parentId":"5501c1b2e4b088b2d50c5c0a","contacts":[{"name":"Christian Giardina","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Forest Service"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Shyh-Chin Chen","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Forest Service"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"David Weise","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Forest Service"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Andrew E.

To reduce overfitting, recent work has used spatial basis functions such as polynomials, B splines, and principal components. Here, we explore an alternative to such basis functions by using regularization to reduce the dimension of the ST model space. In our regularized-ST method, traditional ST is an end member of a continuous spectrum of models. We use an evidence information criterion (EIC = \u22122 times the log of the prior predictive distribution) to select the optimal value of the regularization parameter, instead of the usual L-curve method, because the EIC can also be used to evaluate basis function models yet does not require counting model parameters. To test the method, we apply it to historical shoreline data from Kailua, Hawaii, comparing the results with those from B splines (basis functions) and traditional ST. As expected, the regularized-ST and B-spline models both give shoreline change rates that vary more smoothly alongshore than the rates from ST. The regularized-ST model, along with the B-spline model, also shows significantly better predictive capability over the traditional ST model from a fivefold cross-validation. The regularized-ST model is more straightforward to implement than splines and may be attractive to users because of its continuous connection with the familiar ST method.","parentId":"537cca5ce4b00e1e1a484abf","contacts":[{"name":"Tiffany R.

This economy depends on a healthy coral ecosystem, which is increasingly under multiple threats from global climate change and local land based pollution. Sediment, nutrients, and other pollutants are transported to coastal waters in runoff, groundwater seepage, and atmospheric fallout. These pollutants degrade coral ecosystems by blocking light used for photosynthesis, inhibiting coral larval recruitment, directly smothering and abrading coral, and triggering increases in macroalgae. The research team will construct a more authoritative sediment budget for West Maui watersheds, and incorporate the information into modeling. Project objectives include: 1) Surveying legacy deposits of in fine-grained fill terraces along four representative streams that produced sediment plumes in 2014; 2) Instrumenting four sites on these streams to estimate bank-erosion rates of fine sediments; 3) Translating findings into Bayesian models to estimate erosion. These activities will produce a sediment budget that allows users to focus mitigation efforts on the sources of sediment they expect be most concerned about.","parentId":"5501c1b2e4b088b2d50c5c0a","contacts":[{"name":"Kirsten Oleson","oldPartyId":64686,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"koleson@hawaii.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Kirsten","lastName":"Oleson","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"John Stock","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pacific Islands CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Pacific Islands CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2015"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2015-06","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2017-06","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-07-09T11:44:07.366-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-11-13T10:24:35.291-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Type","value":"Grant"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Number","value":"G15AP00103"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Type","value":"COA"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Number","value":"CM4200"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":48475,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":48475}]}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=559eb2e7e4b0b94a64018fd9&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=559eb2e7e4b0b94a64018fd9&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=559eb2e7e4b0b94a64018fd9&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=559eb2e7e4b0b94a64018fd9","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/559eb2e7e4b0b94a64018fd9\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""}],"csc":"Pacific Islands CSC","parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Kirsten Oleson","John Stock"],"orgs":["Pacific Islands CSC"],"funding_years":"2015","fy":"2015"},"5876ea05e4b0aa226e1d2412":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/53b1bf0be4b0c9da2f809d29","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Mapping Ocean Currents Through Human Observations: Insights from Hilo Bay, Hawai'i","relatedTitle":"Hawaiian Seascapes and Their Management Implications","id":"5876ea05e4b0aa226e1d2412","relatedId":"53b1bf0be4b0c9da2f809d29","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5876ea05e4b0aa226e1d2412","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Hawaiian Seascapes and Their Management Implications","relatedTitle":"Mapping Ocean Currents Through Human Observations: Insights from Hilo Bay, Hawai'i","id":"53b1bf0be4b0c9da2f809d29","relatedId":"5876ea05e4b0aa226e1d2412","annotation":null}]},"id":"5876ea05e4b0aa226e1d2412","title":"Mapping Ocean Currents Through Human Observations: Insights from Hilo Bay, Hawai'i","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10745-016-9822-0):&nbsp;Complex systems, such as ocean currents, occur at multiple temporal and physical scales require simultaneous analysis across a range of geographic scales. Presently, there are few available nearshore current maps or models accessible to managers or the public in Hawai'i despite the fact that predicting nearshore currents and processes is important for understanding many other social-ecological interactions. Maps of coastal ocean currents are difficult to create because of constant change and the limited availability of nearshore data. Maps are symbols of our collective knowledge frameworks, representing various geographic areas and features that humans utilize. Our objectives were to understand human observations of nearshore ocean currents and the ability of ocean observers to communicate this knowledge. In Hilo Bay, Hawai'i, we asked 30 experienced ocean users, based on their natural observations, to create ocean current maps that share their knowledge of the seascape, and important processes that define each area. We then compared the scale of human observations of the seascapes with automated coastal observatories. We find that ocean observers were able to communicate their knowledge regarding ocean currents on maps at multiple spatial scales, and particularly commented spatially at a 1:5000 map scale. Understanding differences and similarities between the human observation scale and the in-situ mechanical observatories enable a more complete understanding of small-scale oceanic environments.","parentId":"53b1c03fe4b0c9da2f80a567","contacts":[{"name":"Springer US","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Noelani Puniwai","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Hilo"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Steven Gray","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Michigan State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Christopher A.

In many parts of the world, this decrease in temperature is a limiting factor for vegetation\u2014at certain elevations, the temperature becomes too cold for plants to survive. However in the tropics, moisture availability may play a more important role than temperature in determining the altitude at which forests can grow. For example on Haleakal\u0101, a volcano on the Hawaiian Island of Maui, the forest line is not found at the same elevation everywhere, as you would expect if it were controlled by temperature. Rather, the forest line is highest in the wetter eastern-most end and lower on the drier, western end of the volcano.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nResearch also suggests that short-duration extreme climate events that cause changes in moisture, such as El Ni\u00f1o, can control the upper limit of forests more than long-term average climate does. This is because species found at the forest line are often already near their physiological limits, so extreme changes can have a big effect on their survival.&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nA strong El Ni\u00f1o occurred in Hawai\u2019i in 2015 and provided researchers with a unique opportunity to observe how vegetation responds to ensuing climate variability. Researchers are focusing on <em>Metrosideros polymorpha<\/em>, a species of flowering evergreen native to Hawai\u2019i. This species is the dominant canopy tree found near the forest line and will be used as an indicator for how the forest line responds to El Ni\u00f1o-driven drought. Specifically, the objectives of this study are to:<br>\n(1) Observe the climate and ecosystem processes at locations near and above the forest line on Haleakal\u0101 during an El Ni\u00f1o event.<br>\n(2) Determine how the ecosystem responds to changes in climate, such as drought, caused by El Ni\u00f1o.<br>\n(3) Determine whether plant responses to short-term changes in climate and drought vary along the cross-slope rainfall gradient.<\/div>\n","purpose":"The upper limits of forests around the world are generally controlled by temperature, especially in temperate regions, i.e., forests cannot survive at higher elevations because it is too cold. In tropical and subtropical regions, however, evidence suggests that moisture availability may be the most important factor controlling forest line position, i.e., forests cannot survive at higher elevations because it is too dry. In particular, moisture availability during short-duration extreme climate events that cause drought (e.g., El Ni\u00f1o events) may control forest line position more directly than long-term average climate. We have evidence that this is the case for the forest line on windward Haleakal\u0101.\n\nA recent study found that the position of the cloud forest\u2019s upper limit on windward Haleakal\u0101 was most strongly related to relative humidity during a strong El Ni\u00f1o drought and only secondarily with average rainfall. These data suggest the forest line may be particularly responsive to strong, short-duration drought events because plant species here, particularly the dominant canopy tree Metrosideros polymorpha (\u2018\u014dhi\u2018a), are near their physiological limits. The forest line position on the windward Haleakal\u0101 slope is not found at the same elevation everywhere, as you would expect if it were controlled by temperature. In our study area, the forest line is highest (2200 m) in the wetter eastern-most end and is 200 m lower in the western end. On the eastern end (NE Rift), annual rainfall averages ~ 6900 mm at the forest line, whereas < 5 km west of there (Pu\u2018u Alaea), annual rainfall measures ~ 5600 mm at the forest line. These patterns suggest that forest line is not controlled simply by the average climate pattern. Another recent study found clear differences across this forest line ecotone in water relations of \u2018\u014dhi\u2018a related to microclimate. This baseline study provided an important snapshot of the potential role of water relations in determining forest line position; however, it occurred during a relatively wet window of time over one 10-day period.\n\nThe objectives of this project are to 1) observe microclimate and ecosystem processes at sites near and above the forest line ecotone during the period from Fall 2014 through Summer 2015, 2) determine the response of ecosystem processes to climate variability within the study period, and 3) determine whether plant responses to climate variability and water stress vary along the cross-slope rainfall gradient. This study will provide crucial data, measured for the first time, on how ecophysiological characteristics of M. polymorpha vary in response to climate variability and how the response differs along the cross-slope gradient.","parentId":"5362adade4b0c409c6289bab","contacts":[{"name":"Thomas Giambelluca","type":"Principal

Future Avian Malaria Threats to Hawaiian Forest Birds from Climate Change","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0168880):&nbsp;Avian malaria, transmitted by&nbsp;<em>Culex quinquefasciatus<\/em>&nbsp;mosquitoes in the Hawaiian Islands, has been a primary contributor to population range limitations, declines, and extinctions for many endemic Hawaiian honeycreepers. Avian malaria is strongly influenced by climate; therefore, predicted future changes are expected to expand transmission into higher elevations and intensify and lengthen existing transmission periods at lower elevations, leading to further population declines and potential extinction of highly susceptible honeycreepers in mid- and high-elevation forests. Based on future climate changes and resulting malaria risk, we evaluated the viability of alternative conservation strategies to preserve endemic Hawaiian birds at mid and high elevations through the 21st&nbsp;century. We linked an epidemiological model with three alternative climatic projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project to predict future malaria risk and bird population dynamics for the coming century. Based on climate change predictions, proposed strategies included mosquito population suppression using modified males, release of genetically modified refractory mosquitoes, competition from other introduced mosquitoes that are not competent vectors, evolved malaria-tolerance in native honeycreepers, feral pig control to reduce mosquito larval habitats, and predator control to improve bird demographics. Transmission rates of malaria are predicted to be higher than currently observed and are likely to have larger impacts in high-elevation forests where current low rates of transmission create a refuge for highly-susceptible birds. As a result, several current and proposed conservation strategies will be insufficient to maintain existing forest bird populations. We concluded that mitigating malaria transmission at high elevations should be a primary conservation goal. Conservation strategies that maintain highly susceptible species like Iiwi (<em>Drepanis coccinea<\/em>) will likely benefit other threatened and endangered Hawai\u2019i species, especially in high-elevation forests. Our results showed that mosquito control strategies offer potential long-term benefits to high elevation Hawaiian honeycreepers. However, combined strategies will likely be needed to preserve endemic birds at mid elevations. Given the delay required to research, develop, evaluate, and improve several of these currently untested conservation strategies we suggest that planning should begin expeditiously.","parentId":"50462fabe4b0241d49d62bf9","contacts":[{"name":"Wei Liao","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Carter T.

Since many plants and animals depend on specific types of climate, it is imperative to understand: (1) the details of species\u2019 climatic preferences; (2) how climates may change in the future; and (3) how species may respond to these changes. Species distribution modeling (SDM) is an increasingly important tool to address conservation biology and global change issues. As Fortini and colleagues described in their largest vulnerability assessment in the US, SDMs provide critical information on biological refuges and potential future shifts in species ranges. In addition, climate changes could alter not only range, but abundance and capacity to persist. Whereas explicit spatial habitat models typically project occurrence, here we generate species models of abundance projected in response to environmental predictors.&nbsp;<br> <br> \u200bThis project gathered together over 35 years of data from thousands of locations in Hawai\u2018i where vegetation was surveyed recording the details of all plant species found at each site. This permitted us to relate characteristics of the vegetation to specific aspects of the climate (in terms of rainfall and temperature, for example) that can be derived from detailed climate maps. We excluded highly invaded plots for the native species models, whereas agricultural and urban areas were included in the modeling to show pre-development scenarios. We focused on ten important native and five important invasive plant species (mostly trees) in order to understand the characteristics of each species\u2019 preferred climatic habitat. Species were selected based on their ecological \u201cimportance\u201d in communities, as well as on how much field data was available to analyze for this study. Colleagues at the University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa, USGS, NOAA, and other agencies were simultaneously researching how climate is changing and producing maps of projected future climate. Using these climate projections, and the relationships we have drawn about each species\u2019 preferences, we produced estimates of where species\u2019 best habitat may be in the future. For native species, this is important because these areas may be key locations to focus conservation efforts, especially since many unique animals depend on native vegetation. For invasive species, these projections provide managers a powerful tool with which to target areas for control before invasive species are able to move into new habitats (and potentially disrupt natural ecosystem processes). To that end, we also examined characteristics of species growth rates and how their fruits\/seeds are dispersed in order to understand how quickly they may be able to respond to changing climates and potentially move into newly emerging habitat. Together, the present and future habitat maps&nbsp;and the ecological characteristics of our focal species provide an initial set of supporting tools for managers and decision makers.&nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"5006f8a0e4b0abf7ce733fbd","contacts":[{"name":"Jonathan Price","oldPartyId":15508,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jpprice@hawaii.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai`i at Hilo and U.S. Geological Survey"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"808-974-7547","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"James D Jacobi","oldPartyId":4974,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jjacobi@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey, Pacific Islands Ecosystems Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"808-587-7456","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pacific Islands CSC","oldPartyId":59614,"type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Tamara Wong","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project","Data"],"browseTypes":["Shapefile","Downloadable","Map Service","OGC WMS Layer","OGC WFS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder","Downloadable","Mappable"],"tags":[{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"vegetation"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Climate change"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Pacific Islands CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2012"},{"name":"Species Abundance"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2012-09-17","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2015-04-30","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2012-07-26T12:48:01.074-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-20T13:48:59.022-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"Completed","facetName":"Project","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"boundingBox":{"minY":18.893348274082,"minX":-160.25048038569,"maxY":22.23262253334,"maxX":-154.7321174512},"facetName":"Shapefile","name":"coast_n83","files":[{"processed":false,"size":1470768,"dateUploaded":"2013-08-05T12:46:08.000Z","name":"coast_n83.shp","pathOnDisk":"__disk__d5\/be\/bf\/d5bebfe942f644efb3d4bcf9ecb4067ba5e6fe27","contentType":"x-gis\/x-shapefile","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/501190e1e4b0d78fd4e59ba8?f=__disk__d5%2Fbe%2Fbf%2Fd5bebfe942f644efb3d4bcf9ecb4067ba5e6fe27"},{"processed":false,"size":1052,"dateUploaded":"2013-08-05T12:46:16.000Z","name":"coast_n83.dbf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__6a\/bc\/95\/6abc951a61be8b7e7dac42c1ad35a134ead7ef74","contentType":"application\/octet-stream","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/501190e1e4b0d78fd4e59ba8?f=__disk__6a%2Fbc%2F95%2F6abc951a61be8b7e7dac42c1ad35a134ead7ef74"},{"processed":false,"size":204,"dateUploaded":"2013-08-05T12:46:16.000Z","name":"coast_n83.shx","pathOnDisk":"__disk__5f\/69\/c8\/5f69c8efd72796d7f03f73dcc9157162ec1342dd","contentType":"x-gis\/x-shapefile","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/501190e1e4b0d78fd4e59ba8?f=__disk__5f%2F69%2Fc8%2F5f69c8efd72796d7f03f73dcc9157162ec1342dd"},{"processed":false,"size":424,"dateUploaded":"2013-08-05T12:46:16.000Z","name":"coast_n83.prj","pathOnDisk":"__disk__c2\/d1\/70\/c2d1704e33c5f6ca6abea14fa43389fef64a1056","contentType":"text\/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/501190e1e4b0d78fd4e59ba8?f=__disk__c2%2Fd1%2F70%2Fc2d1704e33c5f6ca6abea14fa43389fef64a1056"}],"nativeCrs":"EPSG:26904","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ShapefileFacet","geometryType":"MultiPolygon"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":169200,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2012","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":81075},{"year":"2013","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":88125}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":2022,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":1588526,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-03-10T13:08:54.000Z","name":"PI-2012-3_Acacia_Koa_in `Ola`a Tract_JimJacobi_USGS.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__86\/10\/12\/8610127ac1082cefb12c78f339a3af4d5c08d20a","title":"Acacia Koa in 'Ola'a tract -

This study relied on ocean-expert knowledge gained from place-based first-hand work and lifestyle experience. The ocean-experts were categorized as fisher, paddler, sailor, surfers, or others. The interviews were collected during 2014-2015, with prototype interviews collected in 2009. During the interview the ocean-expert was asked to select the appropriate map scale for their area of expertise (1:5000, 1:20,000, 1:40,000, or 1:100,000) and to describe and draw the nearshore currents. Sixteen of the interviewees visually documented on hard copy paper maps their understanding of the near shore currents. There are 30 combinations of location and map scale with four combinations being selected by multiple participants.","purpose":"To anticipate the implications of climate variability we need to first understand the key resources communities need and value. In Hawai'i there is an emphasis on studying both human and ecological systems simultaneously to ensure effective management while recognizing the intercultural differences among the many ocean users. Biophysical values that describe the environment are readily available from in situ data sources such as wave buoys, stream, rainfall and wind gauges. These same values are monitored by ocean communities through their daily interactions along the seashore and in the ocean. Understanding how these resources have changed in the past can assist in forecasting resilience, adaptability and steadystate conditions.","parentId":"53b1c03ae4b0c9da2f80a52c","contacts":[{"name":"Kamakakuokalani Center for Hawaiian Studies, University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa","type":"Point of

National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP\/NCAR) reanalysis data from wet season months (November to April) 1958\u20132010 are composited for heavy rain days at 12 rainfall stations in the Hawaiian Islands. The occurrence of heavy rain events (days with amounts above the 90th percentile estimated from all wet season rain days 1958\u20132010) was found to be strongly correlated with upper level cyclonic circulation anomalies centered northwest of Hawai\u2018i and south-to-north transport of water vapor in the middle troposphere. The statistical downscaling model (SD) developed in this study was able to reproduce the observed interannual variations in the number of heavy rain events based on cross-validation resampling during the more recent interval 1978\u20132010. However, multidecadal changes associated with the mid-1970s\u2019 climate shift were not well reproduced by the SD using NCEP\/NCAR reanalysis data, likely due to inhomogenities in the presatellite period of the NCEP\/NCAR reanalysis. Application of the SD to two model scenarios from the CMIP3 database indicates a reduction of heavy rain events in the mid- to late 21st century. Based on these models, the likelihood of a widespread increase in synoptic heavy rain events in Hawai\u2018i as a result of anthropogenic climate change is low over the remainder of the century.&nbsp;","parentId":"50461ce0e4b0241d49d62bdb","contacts":[{"name":"Oliver Elison Timm","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Mami Takahashi","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Thomas W.

Panel regression is used to overcome limitations of traditional regression methods, and obtain reliable model coefficients, in particular to understand the elasticity of streamflow to rainfall. Using annual rainfall and selected basin characteristics at 86 gaged streams in the Hawaiian Islands, regional regression models for three stream classes were developed to estimate the annual low-flow duration discharges. Three panel-regression structures (random effects, fixed effects, and pooled) were compared to traditional regression methods, in which space is substituted for time. Results indicated that panel regression generally was able to reproduce the temporal behavior of streamflow and reduce the standard errors of model coefficients compared to traditional regression, even for models in which the unobserved heterogeneity between streams is significant and the variance inflation factor for rainfall is much greater than 10. This is because both spatial and temporal variability were better characterized in panel regression. In a case study, regional rainfall elasticities estimated from panel regressions were applied to ungaged basins on Maui, using available rainfall projections to estimate plausible changes in surface-water availability and usable stream habitat for native species.

We show that the surface air temperature (SAT) over Guam is likely to increase by 1.5 \u2013 2.0 \u00b0C for RCP4.5 and by 3.0 \u2013 3.5 \u00b0C for RCP8.5, while the projected SAT increases over American Samoa are slightly smaller. The projected annual mean future rainfall changes for Guam are not statistically significant in any location in either the RCP4.5 or RCP8.5 scenarios. However, American Samoa is projected to be wetter with the late 21st century mean rainfall increasing by ~20-25% at most locations. The frequency of weak tropical cyclones (TCs) will significantly decrease within 500 km around Guam, while that of strong TCs will increase.

In Hawai\u02bbi, seascapes are particularly important given that the ocean contributes considerably to the well-being of coastal communities which are vulnerable to climate change and other human pressures.

In this presentation, Noelani will discuss observations of the seascape shared by recreationists, fishers, and respected ocean watermen in Hilo, Hawai\u02bbi, to describe how people on the seascape internalize climate and environmental changes important to their interactions with the resource. By working with respected ocean observers, Noelani and her colleagues are learning more about changes that have been witnessed over time and the spatial scales and ocean conditions important to the communities. Managing complex seascapes requires the integration of both human and mechanical observations to ensure that multiple systems of knowledge are included and valued; strengthening our understanding of

Report","body":"Knowing the importance of pa\u02bbakai (salt) and its cultural significance is critical to the survival of the people of Hawai\u02bbi. Through the 1950s pa\u02bbakai was an important resource for the endurance of people in Hawai\u2018i due to the non-existence of electricity and refrigerators. Hana pa\u02bbakai (making salt) was a cultural practice needed for the people to survive during traditional before western influences in the 1800s because they had nothing to help preserve their food. K\u016bpuna (elders) belived that every moku (district) had a coastal wahi hana pa\u02bbakai (sacred salt pond) of either k\u0101heka (tide pools) with small hollows in the shoreline pohaku (stone) or loko pa\u02bbakai (salt lakes). Pa\u02bbakai was commonly valued for preserving food, medicinal and spiritual uses. The goal of this project is to identify traditional and modern wahi hana pa\u02bbakai on the island of Hawai\u02bbi. The importance of salt, the process or methods used to harvest salt, and the change of the practice will be looked at as an ideal backing to this cultural practice over time. Within this research project, I will analyze cultural assessments, books, and newspapers that documented salt making locations and the process of the practice. As well as contacting k\u016bpuna and lawai\u02bba (fisherman) experts known in the communities of Hawai\u02bbi to discuss the importance of salt to their families and salt lands. As a result, the k\u016bpuna and lawai\u02bba experts I interviewed believe that every moku had a wahi hana pa\u2018akai and if not, they would have to hike down to the coastline or trade in order to get pa\u02bbakai. Cultural resource assessments and land development plans between 1994 and 2014 she documentation of salt ponds in several ahupua\u02bba (land division) around Hawai\u02bbi. Today, salt can easily be bought in stores for $7.00 or more depending on per pound. Families around the island still holoholo (cruise or hang out) to the kai (ocean) and harvest salt to feed them. Not many records of wahi hana pa\u02bbakai were found in the newspaper, books, and resources I looked in. There was also a lack of map records for these types of places. A salt taste survey was conducted in this research to identify the skills of salt and ocean experts vs. people who simply know the areas of salt harvested from. Overall the cultural practice and wahi hana pa\u02bbakai are not as common.","parentId":"53b1c03fe4b0c9da2f80a567","contacts":[{"name":"Makamae

changes in Hawai\u2018i based on the CMIP5 global model projections","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/2014JD022059\/abstract):&nbsp;Seasonal mean rainfall projections for Hawai\u2018i are given based on statistical downscaling of the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) global model results for two future representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The spatial information content of our statistical downscaling method is improved over previous efforts through the inclusion of spatially extensive, high-quality monthly rainfall data set and the use of improved large-scale climate predictor information. Predictor variables include moisture transport in the middle atmosphere (700 hPa), vertical temperature gradients, and geopotential height fields of the 1000 and 500 hPa layers. The results allow for the first time to derive a spatially interpolated map with future rainfall change estimates for the main Hawaiian Islands. The statistical downscaling was applied to project wet (November\u2013April) and dry (May\u2013October) season rainfall anomalies for the middle and late 21st century. Overall, the statistical downscaling gives more reliable results for the wet season than for the dry season. The wet-season results indicate a pronounced dipole structure between windward facing mountain slopes and the leeward side of most of the islands. The climatically wet regions on the windward slopes of the mountain regions are expected to become wetter or remain stable in their seasonal precipitation amounts. On the climatically dry leeward sides of Kaua\u2018i, O\u2018ahu, Maui, and Hawai\u2018i Island, future precipitation exhibits the strongest drying trends. The projected future rainfall anomaly pattern is associated with a circulation anomaly that resembles a shift in the position or strength of the subtropical high and the average location of extratropical troughs. These new results suggest that a negative trend dominates the area-averaged changes in the statistical downscaling over the Hawaiian Islands. However, the islands are expected to experience a greater contrast between the wet and dry regions in the future.","parentId":"50461ce0e4b0241d49d62bdb","contacts":[{"name":"Oliver Elison Timm","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"State University of New York at Albany"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Thomas W.

evaluated at high-elevation sites on the island of Maui, Hawai\u2018i. Departures from monthly means were assessed for the 6 month Hawaiian wet and dry seasons over the period 1988 to 2012. Linear regression analysis was used to characterize trends in each season. For the dry season (May\u2013October), statistically significant (p \u2264 0.05) positive trends of 9\u201318 W m\u22122 (3\u20136%) per decade were found at all four high-elevation stations tested. Wet season trends were not significant, except at the highest-elevation station, which had a significant negative trend. No consistent trends in aerosol concentrations have been observed at high elevations in Hawai\u2018i; therefore, the observed dry season brightening is most likely the result of decreasing cloud cover. Supporting this hypothesis, analysis of 15 years (1997\u20132012) of high temporal resolution Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imagery over the Hawaiian Islands showed a statistically significant decrease in leeward cloud cover amounting to 5\u201311% per decade over the stations. In addition, analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data were in general agreement with the GOES trends, although statistically significant dry season trends were found at only one of the four stations.","parentId":"504632afe4b0241d49d62c17","contacts":[{"name":"Longman, Ryan J.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Giambelluca, Thomas W.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alliss, Randall J.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Barnes, Mallory L.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pacific Islands CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/2013JD021322\/abstract","title":"Abstract Text Link","hidden":false},{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/2013JD021322\/full","title":"Full Text Link","hidden":false},{"type":"pdf","typeLabel":"PDF Download","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/2013JD021322\/pdf","title":"Publication PDF","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Spatial and temporal variations"},{"name":"solar radiation"},{"name":"satellite-derived cloud climatology data"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-05","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-07-01T10:39:42.073-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-18T16:04:28.471-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1002\/2013JD021322"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"startPage","value":"6022"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issn","value":"2169-8996"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issue","value":"10"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"endPage","value":"6033"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"volume","value":"119"}],"edition":"2014: Volume 119, issue 10","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Pacific Islands CSC","parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48","people":["Longman, Ryan J.","Giambelluca, Thomas W.","Alliss, Randall J.","Barnes, Mallory L."],"orgs":["Pacific Islands CSC"]},"559eb774e4b0b94a64019004":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"559eb774e4b0b94a64019004","title":"The Pacific Islands Regional Climate Assessment (PIRCA) Sustained Assessment & Research","body":"In order to better document, manage, and adapt to the impacts of future climate variability and change on diverse natural resources in Hawai\u02bbi and the US Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI), several regional climate research programs including the Pacific RISA, the PICCC, the NOAA RCSD, and the East-West Center came together in 2011-2012 to collaboratively produce the Pacific Islands Regional Climate Assessment (PIRCA) (Keener, 2012) for the 2014 U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA). Natural resource managers in sectors such as freshwater, coastal inundation and hazard response, and marine and terrestrial ecosystems need frequently updated summaries of regional and local climate trends, projections, and impacts to better include future climate in their planning strategies. Managers also desire translation of technical climate variables into sectorally relevant impacts and subsequent action and policy responses (Spooner et al., 2013).

How the landscape changes has implications for local cultural values and beliefs. To gain a better understanding of how communities change over time socially and physically, we conducted semi-structured interviews with surfers who are known as experts in the surf spot of Honoli'i Bay located in Hilo, Hawaii. Interview methods included diagrams, open-ended questions, and photographs. Within the community, we interviewed 12 surfers considered to be local experts on surf conditions to ask about their observations. The expert surfers provided a better understanding of (1) great, average, and poor surf conditions at Honoli'i, (2) changes both socially and physically over time and (3) whether the surf quality has changed over time through the eyes of someone within the community. Stories shared by the expert surfers were formed into four themes; social perceptions, sense of place, environmental changes, and changes in surf quality. The themes illustrate what has changed over time and were observed by these local watermen first-hand. Through this interview, we discovered the resiliency of the community towards social and physical changes in the seascape and the communities ability to adapt.","parentId":"53b1c03fe4b0c9da2f80a567","contacts":[{"name":"Stephanie Kung","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pacific Islands CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"tags":[{"name":"seascapes"}],"dates":[{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2015-08-05","label":"Date Reported"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-01-07T14:35:24.960-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-01-07T14:36:26.855-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":827934,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-01-07T21:34:22.000Z","name":"Puniwai HawaiianSeascapes -- PIPES SKung_surf.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__ff\/bf\/94\/ffbf9490630f7b271743f00893a0884446d53400","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/568eda1ce4b0e7a44bc59bab?f=__disk__ff%2Fbf%2F94%2Fffbf9490630f7b271743f00893a0884446d53400"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/568eda1ce4b0e7a44bc59bab","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"UnderstandingSe.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Pacific Islands CSC","parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48","people":["Stephanie Kung"],"orgs":["Pacific Islands CSC"]},"575af95be4b04f417c275287":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"575af95be4b04f417c275287","title":"Understanding the Effect of Climate Change on the Migration of Marshallese Islanders","body":"<div>As one of the lowest-lying island nation-states in the world, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) is acutely vulnerable to sea-level rise and the associated intrusion of saltwater into crucial freshwater supplies. Persistent drought is also destroying important agricultural lands in the RMI. Many Marshallese communities are already experiencing these changes and are migrating to larger islands within the RMI and to other countries, like the U.S., to seek alternative means of making a living. The number of Marshallese residing in the U.S. has rapidly risen over the past two decades, from 7,000 in 2000 to 22,000 in 2010.<br>\n<br>\nThe factors triggering human migration are complex and often intertwined, making it difficult to pinpoint and address specific causes from a public policy perspective. For example, changes in ecosystems due to climate change can cause health problems or food insecurity which may have greater consequences in communities with political, social, or economic tension.<br>\n<br>\nDecision makers at local and state levels \u2013 in both the RMI and outside countries \u2013 who may be considering policies related to immigrant access to services and population change, need information to better understand the factors contributing to current migration, and to anticipate possible future impacts of climate on human migration.<br>\n<br>\nThis project will examine the extent to which we can identify direct and indirect links between patterns of human migration and climate events. The researchers will examine migration trends and motivations, characterize changes that have taken place to local lands and ecosystems in the RMI, and use projections of climate change to understand which islands and communities may be at highest risk in the future.

As a result of climate change Hawai\u02bbi is predicted to experience a significant decrease in precipitation. And although Hawai\u02bbi is not currently experiencing unavailability of freshwater resources the focus of this study is to begin to understand one of the most abundant freshwater resources in Hawai\u02bbi, freshwater springs. Three approaches were used to begin understanding the freshwater springs in Keaukaha, HI; reading through literature, conducting field surveys as well as conducting informal interviews. Through the field surveys it was found that shoreline springs are easier to sample at lower low tides during new and full moons. It was also found that the shoreline springs move with the tides. Through the informal interviews it was found that to study and protect the freshwater springs in Keaukaha, HI we must also study and protect Lake Waiau on Mauna Kea. It was also found that in order to study p\u016bn\u0101wai we must observe them through a Hawaiian perspective.

Along with increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and warming temperatures, rainfall, cloud cover, storm frequency, and other aspects of climate will also change. These shifts are likely to have effects on plants, such as changing the amount of water they use or how fast they grow. In this project, we investigated the connections between environmental conditions (such as temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, humidity, wind speed, soil moisture) and plant water use and growth rates of two forest ecosystems in Hawai\u2018i. Based on those connections, we sought to project how a specific set of possible future climate changes will affect water use and growth of these forests. The forests chosen for study represent relatively undisturbed native forest and a forest that has been invaded by the non-native tree strawberry guava. As a result of this study, we have found that more water is used at the non-native forest site, and growth characteristics of the two sites are different. Projections of changes that will be caused by future climate change show that both forests will use more water and will grow more slowly. It appears that both of these effects will be greater for the non-native site, i.e., the water use will increase more for the non-native forest and the growth will be reduced more there. Our findings are important because future increases in forest water use caused by climate change could reduce the availability of groundwater resources and streamflow. Reduced growth rates could affect forest health and stability, which could further curtail the ecosystem services they provide.<\/div>\n","purpose":"As climate changes in Hawai`i over the next 100 years, shifts in temperature, rainfall, clouds, the amount of CO2 in the air, and other variables will impact Hawaiian forests. These effects may include changes in growth rates and water use by forest vegetation. Many native forests in Hawai\u2018i are being invaded by non-native species, with devastating effects on the native ecosystems and possible negative consequences for water supply and water quality. With climate change, current and future efforts to slow the spread of non-native species, preserve Hawai`i\u2019s native ecosystems, and maintain healthy stream flow and groundwater recharge rates will be affected by climate-related changes in vegetation. Therefore, it is important to gain a better understanding of how the changing climate will affect both native and non-native species, to allow for more effective natural resource management. In this study, researchers will make use of existing scientific results and datasets on how climate variations affect native and non-native forest species, gather new data of this type, and combine that information with estimates of the expected changes in temperature, rainfall, and other variables to simulate the effects of future climate change on Hawai`i\u2019s native and non-native forests.","parentId":"526964d6e4b0584cbe9168d9","contacts":[{"name":"Thomas Giambelluca","type":"Principal

Climate Change Impacts on Coral Reef Ecosystem Services","body":"<div>To better support resilient coral reef ecosystems in Hawai\u02bbi, project researchers propose to provide a dynamic, ecosystem-based decision-support tool for decision makers, non-profits, and community alliances. Regional research and management principles have shifted toward an ecosystem-based approach, but the required decision-support tools remain scarce. The team will develop a pilot decision-support tool for coral reef management that can map, assess, value, and simulate changes in ecosystem service flows under alternative GCC scenarios and adaptation strategies. Ecosystem services are the benefit that humans derive from natural systems, such as coral reefs. The project approach will model how specific GCC impacts (precipitation, temperature, terrestrial evapotranspiration, sea level rise, and coral reef impacts) will affect ecosystem dynamics, and then will translate this into ecosystem goods and services provided to people. The decision support tool will draw on ecological, physical, socio-economic, and ecological-economic models to link changes in watershed conditions with the flow of ecosystem goods and services. Elucidating these linkages can help decision-makers understand the social and economic tradeoffs of their management decisions. The research team will apply the tool to a case study in west Maui communities, translating GCC into human wellbeing terms and making recommendations for adaptation and management.&nbsp;<\/div>\n","parentId":"526964d6e4b0584cbe9168d9","contacts":[{"name":"Kirsten Oleson","type":"Principal

widespread public and official concern about the impacts of anticipated anthropogenic climate change over the coming decades. Such a concern is present globally, but the Hawaiian Islands have special issues in terms of vulnerability of their small, geographically isolated watersheds and ecosystems. The Hawaiian Islands are notable in that they have received considerably less attention from the climate modeling community than most other populated areas of the world. Due to their small dimensions and steep topography, the Hawaiian Islands are poorly resolved in current state-of-the-art global models used for long-term climate simulations. This project will apply a very fine-resolution regional model to downscale global model results to provide the best possible representations of recent past climate and projections of future climate. These simulations will include the key variables needed for land management decisions including rainfall, surface sensible heat fluxes and evaporation, radiative fluxes, wind, and temperature at small horizontal scales for Islands of Oahu and Hawai`i. The complete high-resolution simulations, as well as specialized products such as projected flooding and drought climatologies, will be provided via a web portal to any interested parties.&nbsp;<\/div>\n","parentId":"526964d6e4b0584cbe9168d9","contacts":[{"name":"Yuqing Wang","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"yuqing@hawaii.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai`i at Manoa"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"(808) 956 5609","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"96822","country":"United States","city":"Honolulu","state":"Hawaii","line1":"International Research Center\/SOEST\r\n409G, 1680 East-West Road"}}},{"name":"Kevin Hamilton","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"UH Manoa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Kirsten Oleson","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"UH Manoa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Axel Lauer","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Institute of Advanced Sustainability Studies, Germany"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pacific Islands CSC","oldPartyId":59614,"type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Pacific Islands CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2013"},{"name":"Dynamical Downscaling"},{"name":"Very Fine Resolution"},{"name":"Oahu"},{"name":"Hawai'i"},{"name":"Climate Change Scenarios"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2013-08-31","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2015-09-16","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-08-22T12:57:27.267-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2017-01-12T09:38:00.201-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"Completed","facetName":"Project","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":204404,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2013","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":100855},{"_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":103549},{"_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":0}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":1592,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-11-29T21:04:14.000Z","title":"View of Oahu North Shore -

Using Models to Link Landscape, Climate, Disease, and Potential Adaptation","body":"The Hawaiian Islands are home to some of the world\u2019s most imperiled forest birds. Introduction of mosquitoes and vector-borne avian malaria are important factors in the historic decline and extinction of many endemic Hawaiian honeycreepers which are particularly susceptible to avian malaria. We used a model of forest birds, mosquitoes, and avian malaria to evaluate future impacts of avian malaria on these Hawaiian birds as a result of climate change. As climate warms during the 21st Century temperatures will favor increased mosquito populations and much higher transmission of malaria to endangered honeycreepers existing in high-elevation forests. We conclude that without significant intervention many native Hawaiian honeycreepers will suffer major population declines and\/or extinction due to this increasing risk from avian malaria.<br>\n<br>\nProposed strategies to mitigate the problem include mosquito population suppression using sterile males or incompatible males, release of mosquitoes which are genetically modified to prevent malaria transmission to birds (e.g., refractory mosquitoes), competition from other introduced mosquitoes, evolved malaria-tolerance in native honeycreepers, feral pig control to reduce mosquito larval habitats, and predator control to improve bird demographics. Because predicted transmission rates of malaria will be higher than currently observed, several conservation strategies including predator removal, competing vectors, and feral pig control were insufficient to maintain these important bird populations at current levels. In contrast, mosquito control strategies offer potential long-term benefits to high-elevation Hawaiian honeycreepers. The predicted higher rate of future disease transmission means that combined strategies will likely be needed to preserve endemic birds at mid elevation. The predicted climate changes are likely to have enormous impacts in high-elevation forests where current low rates of transmission create a refuge for highly-susceptible birds, mitigating malaria transmission should be a primary avian conservation goal. Strategies that maintain highly-susceptible honeycreepers (such as the Iiwi) in high-elevation forests will likely benefit many other endangered Hawaiian birds.","purpose":"All Hawaiian forest bird species are endemic (found only in Hawai'i), and almost all are listed under the Endangered Species Act.  One of the major causes of decline is their extreme sensitivity to introduced avian malaria, which is spread by a species of introduced mosquito.  For decades, Hawaiian forest bird conservation has relied on upper mountain forests to protect bird populations, because the mosquitoes and disease cannot survive in the cooler temperatures.  However, warming temperatures associated with climate change is threatening the conservation function of these upper forest refugia.  With warming, mosquitoes and malaria are able to move up the mountains and are predicted to possibly fill all Hawaiian forest bird habitat with the disease, making it inescapable.  \n\nSuccessful conservation of Hawaiian forest birds requires an analysis of climate change and its impact on the future disease risk of native bird populations. This project uses an ecological\/epidemiological model to predict future dynamics of the bird-mosquito-malaria system in Hawaii in response to future climatic change.  Results will include potential changes in malaria transmission and resulting bird population characteristics (demographics) across the elevation gradient in Hawaii.   Because the bird species are highly vulnerable to the disease, resource management is focusing on potential ways to break or reduce the mosquito and malaria cycle, and models produced by this project will be used to evaluate alternative disease mitigation measures. This project will provide the first quantitative assessment of the long-term impact of climate change on bird malaria distribution and on Hawai`i's unique forest birds, and provide a crucial tool to adaptively manage recovery and promote disease resistance among avian populations.","parentId":"5006f8a0e4b0abf7ce733fbd","contacts":[{"name":"Michael Samuel","oldPartyId":18069,"type":"Principal

archipelago produced a highly endemic and unique avifauna. Avian malaria ( \n<em>Plasmodium relictum<\/em>), an introduced mosquito-borne pathogen, is a primary cause of extinctions and declines of these endemic honeycreepers. Our research assesses how global climate change will affect future malaria risk and native bird populations. We used an epidemiological model to evaluate future bird\u2013mosquito\u2013malaria dynamics in response to alternative climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Climate changes during the second half of the century accelerate malaria transmission and cause a dramatic decline in bird abundance. Different temperature and precipitation patterns produce divergent trajectories where native birds persist with low malaria infection under a warmer and dryer projection (RCP4.5), but suffer high malaria infection and severe reductions under hot and dry (RCP8.5) or warm and wet (A1B) futures. We conclude that future global climate change will cause significant decreases in the abundance and diversity of remaining Hawaiian bird communities. Because these effects appear unlikely before mid-century, natural resource managers have time to implement conservation strategies to protect this unique avifauna from further decimation. Similar climatic drivers for avian and human malaria suggest that mitigation strategies for Hawai'i have broad application to human health.","parentId":"50462fabe4b0241d49d62bf9","contacts":[{"name":"Wei Liao","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Oliver Elison Timm","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University at Albany"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Chunxi Zhang","oldPartyId":64607,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"chunxi@hawaii.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Chunxi","lastName":"Zhang","organization":{"displayText":"University of Hawai'i"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Carter T Atkinson","oldPartyId":352,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"catkinson@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Microbiologist","firstName":"Carter","middleName":"T","lastName":"Atkinson","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Kilauea Field Station, PIERC"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8089678545","officePhone":"8089856401","streetAddress":{"zip":"96718","city":"Hawaii National Park","state":"HI","line1":"Bldg 344 Chain of Craters Rd."},"buildingCode":"WHF","name":"Carter T Atkinson\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"96718","country":"USA","city":"Hawaii National Park","state":"HI","line1":"P.O.

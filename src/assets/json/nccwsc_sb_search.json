A large number of these impoundments currently are being stressed from changes in water supplies and quality, and these problems are forecast to worsen because of projected changes to climate and land use. For example, many managed wetlands in arid regions have become degraded owing to the long-term accumulation of salts and increased salinity associated with evapotranspiration. A primary goal of the USFWS is to provide aquatic habitats for a diversity of waterbirds; thus, wetland managers would benefit from a tool that facilitates evaluation of wetland habitat quality in response to current and anticipated impacts of altered hydrology and salt balances caused by factors such as climate change, water availability, and management actions.\n\nA spreadsheet model that simulates the overall water and salinity balance (WSB model) of managed wetland impoundments is presented. The WSB model depicts various habitat metrics, such as water depth, salinity, and surface areas (inundated, dry), which can be used to evaluate alternative management actions under various water-availability and climate scenarios. The WSB model uses widely available spreadsheet software, is relatively simple to use, relies on widely available inputs, and is readily adaptable to specific locations. The WSB model was validated using data from three National Wildlife Refuges with direct and indirect connections to water resources associated with rivers, and common data limitations are highlighted. The WSB model also was used to conduct simulations based on hypothetical climate and management scenarios to demonstrate the utility of the model for evaluating alternative management strategies and climate futures. The WSB model worked well across a range of National Wildlife Refuges and could be a valuable tool for USFWS staff when evaluating system state and management alternatives and establishing long-term goals and objectives.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50746778e4b090654e7b27af"],"contacts":[{"name":"Brian A.

A passive tracer was introduced in the model to delineate the growth and decay of the plume and to diagnose the spread of the CR discharge in the shelf, into Prince William Sound (PWS) and offshore. Furthermore, a model experiment with doubled discharge was conducted to investigate potential impacts of accelerated glacier melt in future climate scenarios. The 2010 and 2011 simulation revealed that the upstream (eastward) transport in the NGoA is negligible. About 60&nbsp;% of the passive tracer released in the CR discharge is transported southwestward on the shelf, while another one third goes into PWS with close to 60&nbsp;% of which exiting PWS to the shelf from Montague Strait. The rest few percent is transported across the shelf break and exported to the GoA basin. The downstream transport and the transport into PWS are strongly regulated by the downwelling-favorable wind, while the offshore transport is related to the accumulation of plume water in the shelf, frontal instability, and the Alaskan Stream. It takes weeks in spring for the buoyancy to accumulate so that a bulge forms outside of the CR estuary. The absence of strong storms as in the summer of 2010 allows the bulge continue growing to trigger frontal instability. These frontal features can interact with the Alaskan Stream to induce transport pulses across the shelf break. Alternatively as in 2011, a downwelling-favorable wind event in early August (near the peak discharge) accelerates the southwestward coastal current and produces an intense downstream transport event. Both processes result in fast drains of the buoyancy and the plume content, thereby rapid disintegration of the plume in the shelf. The plume in the doubled discharge case can be two to three times in size, which affects not only the magnitude but also the timing of certain transport events. In particular, the offshore transport increases by several folds because the plume appears to be more easily entrained by the seaward flow along the side of Hinchinbrook Canyon.","parentId":"50747f52e4b090654e7b28a3","contacts":[{"name":"Yuan Wang","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Maine"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Huijie Xue","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Maine"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Fei Chai","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Maine"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Yi Chao","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of California"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"John Farrara","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of California"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"NCCWSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10236-013-0684-3","title":"Wang et al. 2016","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"dates":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-08-08T15:18:17.909-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-08-08T16:05:32.673-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Ocean Dynamics","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Volume","value":"64"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Issue","value":"2"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Pages","value":"241\u2013258"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","people":["Yuan Wang","Huijie Xue","Fei Chai","Yi Chao","John Farrara"],"orgs":["NCCWSC"]},"54986f79e4b07df8de5489cc":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/52b4603ee4b029a4958d603f","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"A Morphometric Approach for Stocking Walleye Fingerlings in Lakes Invaded by Rainbow Smelt","relatedTitle":"Climate Change and Resilience of Sport Fisheries in Lakes","id":"54986f79e4b07df8de5489cc","relatedId":"52b4603ee4b029a4958d603f","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/54986f79e4b07df8de5489cc","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Climate Change and Resilience of Sport Fisheries in Lakes","relatedTitle":"A Morphometric Approach for Stocking Walleye Fingerlings in Lakes Invaded by Rainbow Smelt","id":"52b4603ee4b029a4958d603f","relatedId":"54986f79e4b07df8de5489cc","annotation":null}]},"id":"54986f79e4b07df8de5489cc","title":"A Morphometric Approach for Stocking Walleye Fingerlings in Lakes Invaded by Rainbow Smelt","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/02755947.2014.943860#.VJhyqUACo\">http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/02755947.2014.943860#.VJhyqUACo<\/a>):&nbsp;Invasive Rainbow Smelt&nbsp;\n<em>Osmerus mordax<\/em>&nbsp;have been associated with reductions in Walleye&nbsp;\n<em>Sander vitreus<\/em>recruitment, and predation by adult smelt on age-0 Walleyes has been identified as one of the potential mechanisms contributing to recruitment failure.

Most of our assessment focuses on the representation of summertime subseasonal and diurnal variability.Summer precipitation in the Southeast United States is a particularly challenging modeling problem because of the variety of regional-scale phenomena, such as sea breeze, thunderstorms and squall lines, which are not adequately resolved in coarse atmospheric reanalyses but contribute significantly to the hydrological budget over the region. We find that the dynamically downscaled reanalyses are in good agreement with station and gridded observations in terms of both the relative seasonal distribution and the diurnal structure of precipitation, although total precipitation amounts tend to be systematically overestimated. The diurnal cycle of summer precipitation in the downscaled reanalyses is in very good agreement with station observations and a clear improvement both over their \"parent\" reanalyses and over newer-generation reanalyses. The seasonal cycle of precipitation is particularly well simulated in the Florida; this we attribute to the ability of the regional model to provide a more accurate representation of the spatial and temporal structure of finer-scale phenomena such as fronts and sea breezes. Over the northern portion of the domain summer precipitation in the downscaled reanalyses remains, as in the \"parent\" reanalyses, overestimated. Given the degree of success that dynamical downscaling of reanalyses demonstrates in the simulation of the characteristics of regional precipitation, its favorable comparison to conventional newer-generation reanalyses and its cost-effectiveness, we conclude that for the Southeast United states such downscaling is a viable proxy for high-resolution conventional reanalysis.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["507466bce4b090654e7b278d"],"contacts":[{"name":"Lydia Stefanova","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Vasubandhu Misra","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Steven Chan","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Melissa Griffin","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"James J.

As such, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN) ensemble model to predict mean daily water temperature in 197,402 individual stream reaches during the warm season (May-October) throughout the native range of brook trout \n<em>Salvelinus fontinalis<\/em> in the eastern U.S. We compared four models with different groups of predictors to determine how well water temperature could be predicted by climatic, landform, and land cover attributes, and used the median prediction from an ensemble of 100 ANNs as our final prediction for each model. The final model included air temperature, landform attributes and forested land cover and predicted mean daily water temperatures with moderate accuracy as determined by root mean squared error (RMSE) at 886 training sites with data from 1980 to 2009 (RMSE&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.91&nbsp;&deg;C). Based on validation at 96 sites (RMSE&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.82) and separately for data from 2010 (RMSE&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.93), a year with relatively warmer conditions, the model was able to generalize to new stream reaches and years. The most important predictors were mean daily air temperature, prior 7&nbsp;day mean air temperature, and network catchment area according to sensitivity analyses. Forest land cover at both riparian and catchment extents had relatively weak but clear negative effects. Predicted daily water temperature averaged for the month of July matched expected spatial trends with cooler temperatures in headwaters and at higher elevations and latitudes. Our ANN ensemble is unique in predicting daily temperatures throughout a large region, while other regional efforts have predicted at relatively coarse time steps. The model may prove a useful tool for predicting water temperatures in sampled and unsampled rivers under current conditions and future projections of climate and land use changes, thereby providing information that is valuable to management of river ecosystems and biota such as brook trout.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> This publication was produced as a part of the research project, \n<a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/display-project\/5050cc14e4b0be20bb30eac8\/50a64a5ae4b0d446a665ca73\">Projected Vulnerability of Brook Trout to Climate and Land Use Changes in the Eastern U.S. (Regional Assessment)<\/a>.","parentId":"50a653f7e4b0d446a665cabc","contacts":[{"name":"Jefferson Tyrell DeWeber","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Pennsylvania Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Tyler Wagner","oldPartyId":10824,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"twagner@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Assistant Unit Leader Research Fish Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Tyler","lastName":"Wagner","organization":{"displayText":"Pennsylvania Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8148634710","officePhone":"8148654511","streetAddress":{"zip":"16802","city":"State College","state":"PA","line1":"419 Forest Resources Bldg, PA State Univ"},"buildingCode":"ALC","name":"Tyler Wagner\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"16802","country":"USA","city":"University Park","state":"PA","line1":"419 Forest Resources Building"},"building":"FOREST RESOURCES BUILDING"}},{"name":"NCCWSC","type":"Funding Agency","organization":{"displayText":""},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022169414003990","title":"DeWeber and Wagner 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Water temperature"},{"name":"neural networks"},{"name":"River"},{"name":"Stream"},{"name":"Ensemble"},{"name":"Regional prediction"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-09-19","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-10-13T14:36:24.268-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2014-11-03T13:05:37.584-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Journal of Hydrology","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Volume","value":"517"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Pages","value":"187-200"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI","value":"10.1016\/j.jhydrol.2014.05.035"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","people":["Jefferson Tyrell DeWeber","Tyler Wagner"]},"5579d632e4b032353cc175cc":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/4f833bece4b0e84f608680c0","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"A stochastic bioenergetics model-based approach to translating large river flow and temperature into fish population responses: the pallid sturgeon example","relatedTitle":"Characterizing Uncertainty in the Impact of Global Climate Change on Large River Fishes: Missouri River Sturgeon Example","id":"5579d632e4b032353cc175cc","relatedId":"4f833bece4b0e84f608680c0","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5579d632e4b032353cc175cc","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Characterizing Uncertainty in the Impact of Global Climate Change on Large River Fishes: Missouri River Sturgeon Example","relatedTitle":"A stochastic bioenergetics model-based approach to translating large river flow and temperature into fish population responses: the pallid sturgeon example","id":"4f833bece4b0e84f608680c0","relatedId":"5579d632e4b032353cc175cc","annotation":null}]},"id":"5579d632e4b032353cc175cc","title":"A stochastic bioenergetics model-based approach to translating large river flow and temperature into fish population responses: the pallid sturgeon example","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/sp.lyellcollection.org\/content\/early\/2015\/05\/21\/SP408.10.abstract?cited-by=yes&amp;legid=specpubgsl;SP408.10v1):&nbsp;In managing fish populations, especially at-risk species, realistic mathematical models are needed to help predict population response to potential management actions in the context of environmental conditions and changing climate while effectively incorporating the stochastic nature of real world conditions. We provide a key component of such a model for the endangered pallid sturgeon ( <em>Scaphirhynchus albus<\/em>) in the form of an individual-based bioenergetics model influenced not only by temperature but also by flow. This component is based on modification of a known individual-based bioenergetics model through incorporation of: the observed ontogenetic shift in pallid sturgeon diet from marcroinvertebrates to fish; the energetic costs of swimming under flowing-water conditions; and stochasticity. We provide an assessment of how differences in environmental conditions could potentially alter pallid sturgeon growth estimates, using observed temperature and velocity from channelized portions of the Lower Missouri River mainstem. We do this using separate relationships between the proportion of maximum consumption and fork length and swimming cost standard error estimates for fish captured above and below the Kansas River in the Lower Missouri River. Critical to our matching observed growth in the field with predicted growth based on observed environmental conditions was a two-step shift in diet from macroinvertebrates to fish.","parentId":"507467d9e4b090654e7b27c5","contacts":[{"name":"Mark L Wildhaber","oldPartyId":11236,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"mwildhaber@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Mark","middleName":"L","lastName":"Wildhaber","organization":{"displayText":"Columbia Environmental Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"5738761896","officePhone":"5738761847","streetAddress":{"zip":"65201","city":"Columbia","state":"MO","line1":"4200 New Haven Road"},"buildingCode":"KCK","name":"Mark L Wildhaber\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"65201","country":"USA","city":"Columbia","state":"MO","line1":"4200 New Haven Road"},"building":"CERC - Tech Center"}},{"name":"Rima Dey","oldPartyId":12263,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"rdey@usgs.gov","jobTitle":"Volunteer","firstName":"Rima","lastName":"Dey","organization":{"displayText":"Columbia Environmental Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"5738755399","streetAddress":{"zip":"65201","country":"USA","city":"Columbia","state":"MO","line1":"4200 New Haven Road"},"buildingCode":"KRG","name":"Rima Dey\/BRD\/CONT\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"65201","country":"USA","city":"Columbia","state":"MO","line1":"4200 New Haven Road"},"building":"Building 1 - Main Lab Building"}},{"name":"Christopher K Wikle","oldPartyId":56509,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.","firstName":"Christopher","middleName":"K","lastName":"Wikle","organization":{"displayText":"s, University of Missouri\u2013Columbia"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Edward H Moran","oldPartyId":22861,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"emoran@usgs.gov","jobTitle":"Hydrologist","firstName":"Edward","middleName":"H","lastName":"Moran","organization":{"displayText":"Columbia Environmental Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"5738755399","streetAddress":{"zip":"65201","country":"US","city":"Columbia","state":"MO","line1":"4200 New Haven Road"},"buildingCode":"KRG","name":"Edward H Moran\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"65201","country":"USA","city":"Columbia","state":"MO","line1":"4200 New Haven Road"},"building":"Building 1 - Main Lab Building"}},{"name":"Christopher J Anderson","oldPartyId":56474,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.","firstName":"Christopher","middleName":"J","lastName":"Anderson","organization":{"displayText":"Iowa State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Kristie J Franz","oldPartyId":51005,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.","firstName":"Kristie","middleName":"J","lastName":"Franz","organization":{"displayText":"Iowa State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/sp.lyellcollection.org\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/10\/SP408.10.full.pdf+html","title":"Wildhaber et al. 2015","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Fish"},{"name":"pallid sturgeon"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015-05-28","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-06-11T12:40:50.667-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-07T10:53:25.309-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Geological Society, London, Special Publications","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issn","value":"0305-8719"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"volume","value":"408"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"startPage","value":"SP408.10"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1144\/SP408.10"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","people":["Mark L Wildhaber","Rima Dey","Christopher K Wikle","Edward H Moran","Christopher J Anderson","Kristie J Franz"]},"566846ece4b06a3ea36c8edb":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"566846ece4b06a3ea36c8edb","title":"A Value and Investment Assessment of Marine and Inland Fisheries Globally","body":"Marine and inland fisheries provide substantial economic, nutritional, recreational, and cultural benefits to human populations globally. Though extensive research and management efforts exist to ensure the sustainability of these important resources, many fisheries still face threats including climate change, habitat degradation, and overfishing. The inland fisheries community often cites that less attention is given to inland fisheries compared to marine but, to date, no quantitative analysis has examined these differences. Our goal is to compare investment and resources allocated to the research and management of marine and inland fisheries relative to their value at a global scale. Through the development of an ecosystem services framework, we determine the cost versus benefits of inland fisheries management and conservation to the economy compared to marine fisheries. Through collecting information on direct government investment, including staffing levels for marine and inland fisheries management, we examine the extent to which governments invest in inland and marine management efforts. Lastly, we use case studies from specific countries to highlight at a finer scale investment relative to value of inland and marine fisheries. Effective resource allocation is essential to managing and conserving inland and marine fisheries relative to their value to society. Having a clear understanding of the current investment into these resources globally can assist policy makers by providing a more in-depth understanding of the value and associated investment for fisheries, which are especially important under the increasing threat of climate change on these important resources.","purpose":"To assist policy makers and managers in addressing the management and conservation needs of inland and marine fisheries, especially under the threat of global climate change, by providing a better understanding of the current value and associated investment for fisheries worldwide.","parentId":"55130bdbe4b02e76d75c074f","contacts":[{"name":"Abigail J Lynch","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"ajlynch@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Biologist","firstName":"Abigail","middleName":"J","lastName":"Lynch","organization":{"displayText":"National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center and Climate Science Centers"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"7036484044","officePhone":"7036484097","streetAddress":{"zip":"20192","city":"Reston","state":"VA","line1":"12201 Sunrise Valley Dr"},"buildingCode":"AAA","name":"CN=Abigail J Lynch,OU=NCCWSC,OU=CLU -

We produced a suite of data&nbsp;sets that provide managers with climate and climate-derived data and a visualization approach&nbsp;that allows managers to map where 1) a managed area's potential future climate is located on&nbsp;today's landscape (i.e., the locations of the modern analogues of future climate) and 2) the areas&nbsp;to which the present climate (and habitat) of managed areas are projected to move. We produced downscaled climate data from historical (1901-2000) data sets and from future (2001-2100) climate simulations, generated by both coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation&nbsp;models (AOGCMs) and regional climate models (e.g., RegCM3). Data were downscaled at a&nbsp;relatively coarse resolution (e.g., ~10-km) for North America, and at a finer resolution (e.g., ~1-km) for the contiguous US and Alaska. Based on discussions with land managers, we used the climate data as input to existing environmental models to derive additional variables, such as&nbsp;bioclimate variables (e.g., moisture indices), that are required for management of specific&nbsp;resources (e.g., vegetation and habitat). These data were incorporated into an online web&nbsp;interface that&nbsp;allows managers to download the underlying climate data&nbsp;and to produce maps&nbsp;of future climate analogues.

Here, ring widths of 394 plains cottonwood ( \n<em>Populus deltoides<\/em>, ssp.&nbsp; \n<em>monilifera<\/em>) trees in the North Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, North Dakota, are used to reconstruct streamflow along the Little Missouri River (LMR), North Dakota, US. Different versions of the cottonwood chronology are developed by (1) age-curve standardization (ACS), using age-stratified samples and a single estimated curve of ring width against estimated ring age, and (2) time-curve standardization (TCS), using a subset of longer ring-width series individually detrended with cubic smoothing splines of width against year. The cottonwood chronologies are combined with the first principal component of four upland conifer chronologies developed by conventional methods to investigate the possible value of riparian tree-ring chronologies for streamflow reconstruction of the LMR. Regression modeling indicates that the statistical signal for flow is stronger in the riparian cottonwood than in the upland chronologies. The flow signal from cottonwood complements rather than repeats the signal from upland conifers and is especially strong in young trees (e.g. 5\u201335 years). Reconstructions using a combination of cottonwoods and upland conifers are found to explain more than 50% of the variance of LMR flow over a 1935\u20131990 calibration period and to yield reconstruction of flow to 1658. The low-frequency component of reconstructed flow is sensitive to the choice of standardization method for the cottonwood. In contrast to the TCS version, the ACS reconstruction features persistent low flows in the 19th century. Results demonstrate the value to streamflow reconstruction of riparian cottonwood and suggest that more studies are needed to exploit the low-frequency streamflow signal in densely sampled age-stratified stands of riparian trees.","parentId":"50746778e4b090654e7b27af","contacts":[{"name":"David M Meko","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"The University of Arizona"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jonathan M Friedman","oldPartyId":3417,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"friedmanj@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Hydrologist","firstName":"Jonathan","middleName":"M","lastName":"Friedman","organization":{"displayText":"Fort Collins Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9702269230","officePhone":"9702269318","streetAddress":{"zip":"80526","city":"Fort Collins","state":"CO","line1":"2150 Centre Avenue Bldg C"},"buildingCode":"KBA","name":"Jonathan M Friedman\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

This large-scale perspective for fluvial studies depends on the ability to characterize influences on streams resulting from throughout entire upstream networks or catchments. While acquiring upstream information for a single reach is relatively straight-forward, this process becomes demanding when attempting to obtain summaries for all streams throughout a stream network and across large basins. Additionally, the complex nature of stream networks, including braided streams, adds to the challenge of accurately generating upstream summaries. This paper outlines an approach to solve these challenges by building a database and applying an algorithm to gather upstream landscape information for digitized stream networks. This approach avoids the need to directly use spatial data files in computation, and efficiently and accurately acquires various types of upstream summaries of landscape information across large regions using tabular processing. In particular, this approach is not limited to the use of any specific database software or programming language, and its flexibility allows it to be adapted to any digitized stream network as long as it meets a few minimum requirements. This efficient approach facilitates the growing demand of acquiring upstream summaries at large geographic scales and helps to support the use of landscape information in assisting management and decision-making across large regions.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> This paper was developed as a part of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center funded project,&nbsp;

It is hypothesized here that a self-reinforcing feedback, termed a \u201cvegetation switch,\u201d between vegetation and soil salinity, helps maintain the sharp mangrove\u2013marsh ecotone. A general theoretical implication of the switch mechanism is that the ecotone will be stable to small disturbances but vulnerable to rapid regime shifts from large disturbances, such as storm surges, which could cause large spatial displacements of the ecotone. We develop a simulation model to describe the vegetation switch mechanism. The model couples vegetation dynamics and hydrologic processes. The key factors in the model are the amount of salt-water intrusion into the freshwater wetland and the passive transport of mangrove (e.g., Rhizophora mangle) viviparous seeds or propagules. Results from the model simulations indicate that a regime shift from freshwater marsh to mangroves is sensitive to the duration of soil salinization through storm surge overwash and to the density of mangrove propagules or seedlings transported into the marsh. We parameterized our model with empirical hydrologic data collected from the period 2000\u20132010 at one mangrove\u2013marsh ecotone location in southwestern Florida to forecast possible long-term effects of Hurricane Wilma (24 October 2005). The model indicated that the effects of that storm surge were too weak to trigger a regime shift at the sites we studied, 50 km south of the Hurricane Wilma eyewall, but simulations with more severe artificial disturbances were capable of causing substantial regime shifts.","parentId":"507466bce4b090654e7b278d","webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web

These changes will have an effect on inland fish species, and their associated fisheries, and consequently will impact recreational and subsistence fishers, human communities, and economies. Inland fish are especially vulnerable to climate change because they have limited habitat availability and they have a more direct link with terrestrial systems, human land use patterns, and human water use than fish in marine ecosystems (and human activities are already threatening and weakening inland fish in many areas). With a changing climate, some inland fish may become stressed, resulting in weaker immune systems and lower reproductive success, whereas other inland fish species may actually fare better and become more competitive. To date, little comprehensive research has been conducted to investigate the climate change effects on inland fisheries at a large scale. The objective of this project is to synthesize our understanding of how climate change may affect inland fisheries. Project researchers are actively (a) identifying the key data and knowledge gaps related to how climate change will affect inland fisheries and (b) examining the questions: \u201cdo current and future changes differ by region?\u201d and \u201cdo these changes differ by species, habitat type, or other traits?\u201d.

These native species have amphidromous life cycles, meaning that they spend part of their lives in the ocean and part in freshwater streams. Stream flow serves as a vital natural pathway, connecting saltwater and freshwater habitats so that these animals can migrate between them and carry out critical life stages (e.g., development, reproduction). Over the last 20 years, the amount of rainfall in Hawai\u2018i has decreased, and climate models predict that this trend will continue. It is uncertain how reduced rainfall will affect stream flow and, consequently, the native stream species that depend on it.

In Hawaii, though rainfall intensity has increased, total rainfall has been on the decline for the last two decades and, as a result, reduced stream flow. Climate models project continuous declines in rainfall with uneven spatial distribution. While studies have assessed the impact of changing climate on the vegetation in Hawaii, little is known on how climate change is affecting stream ecosystems, and little is known on how climate change impacts the downstream estuarine and coastal systems.  Streams are an integral link between terrestrial, fluvial, and marine ecosystems. The changes of dynamic patterns of streamflow could result in the temporal and spatial difference in flow, nutrients, and sediments, and in turn affect the fluvial, estuarine, and coastal habitats. In particular, these habitats support the native aquatic species in Hawaii at different stages of their amphidromous life cycle. We propose to understand flow dynamic patterns through stream flow simulation; assess the impact of changes in climate on nine groups of native aquatic species; use tool to prioritize conservation effort for Hawaii aquatic ecosystems. This research proposal has arises explicitly from discussions with local stakeholder groups (e.g., the Hawaii Fish Habitat Partnership) about science needs for aquatic ecosystems to better manage in current conditions and prepare for projected changes.

First, researchers are identifying plausible future habitat scenarios, based on potential changes to climate and possible water allocation decisions that could be made in the two regions, and are determining what these scenarios would mean for waterbirds. Researchers are also modeling how habitat conditions affect bird populations, in order to uncover how projected changes to habitat could influence the long-term survival of waterbirds. Finally, researchers will create a decision-support tool communicating the potential effects of climate change on waterbirds to conservation planners.\n <br> \n <br> The most pressing conservation issues in the Central Valley and interior basins are climate change and ongoing conflicts surrounding water allocation. This study addresses a need to understand the impacts of drought and water allocation policies in the regions on wetlands and the waterbirds that depend on them. This assessment will also contribute to more integrated and efficient climate adaptation planning in the region. Currently, wetland conservation is managed separately by the Central Valley Joint Venture and the Intermountain West Joint Venture, despite the fact that the two regions share bird populations. This assessment examines both regions as a whole, enabling planning to occur across Joint Venture boundaries. \n<\/div>","purpose":"Climate change may a have disproportionate impact on migratory birds, particular those species that rely on wetlands. California\u2019s Central Valley (CV) and the interior basins of southeastern Oregon in northeast California (SONEC) provide the most significant freshwater wetland resources to migratory waterbirds in the western United States. While all wetland-dependent wildlife may be impacted by climate change, the CV and SONEC regions are particularly important to waterfowl during migration and winter; consequently, waterfowl are an ideal species group to rigorously assess the potential impact of climate change in both regions. We will use bioenergetic models to link climate change, habitat wetland availability (in fall winter, and spring), waterfowl foraging conditions, and waterfowl population performance. We will consider a range of possible scenarios that combine how climate change will influence total water resources and how policy makers might allocate water to create an integrated assessment tool to explore the possible impacts to migratory waterfowl that rely on the CV and SONEC wetlands. Results will provide an assessment of possible climate change scenarios on waterfowl, but also create a decision-support tool that can then be applied to other groups of wetland birds.","parentId":"55130bdbe4b02e76d75c074f","contacts":[{"name":"Bruce Dugger","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"bruce.dugger@oregonstate.edu","organization":{"displayText":"Oregon State University"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"null","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"null","state":"null","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"NCCWSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"John Eadie","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of California, Davis"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Joseph P Fleskes","oldPartyId":3256,"type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"joe_fleskes@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Wildlife Biologist","firstName":"Joseph","middleName":"P","lastName":"Fleskes","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Dixon Field Station, WERC"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"7076785039","officePhone":"5306695074","streetAddress":{"zip":"95620","city":"Dixon","state":"CA","line1":"800 Business Park Drive"},"buildingCode":"WDR","name":"Joseph P Fleskes\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"95620","country":"USA","city":"Dixon","state":"CA","line1":"6924 Tremont Road"},"building":"800 Business Park Dr"}},{"name":"Mark Petrie","oldPartyId":64518,"type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"mpetrie@ducks.org","active":true,"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Petrie","organization":{"displayText":"Ducks Unlimited Inc"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Josh Vest","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Intermountain West Joint Venture"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Gregory S Yarris","oldPartyId":33438,"type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from FPPS data from 1992 through 2009.","firstName":"Gregory","middleName":"S","lastName":"Yarris","organization":{"displayText":"Central Valley Joint Venture"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"NCCWSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2015"},{"name":"scenario planning"},{"name":"Waterfowl"},{"name":"Wetlands"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2015-09-01","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2017-08-31","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-03-31T10:52:53.973-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-27T19:40:00.927-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Technical Summary","value":"Wetlands in California\u2019s Central Valley (CV) and southern Oregon and northeast California (SONEC) are the two most significant regions supporting migratory wetland birds in the western U.S. and both are under threats to long term system persistence and function from climate change and water allocation decisions.  We propose to use scenario planning to evaluate the consequences of drought on wetland-dependent birds and integrate planning in the CV and SONEC regions.

We focus analyses on waterfowl, but the framework we create could be extended to other species.  We will use a water evaluation and planning (WEAP) model to link climate and policy scenarios to habitat conditions and use two bioenergetics models (TRUEMET and SWAMP) to link habitat conditions to waterfowl foraging conditions and bird body condition and survival.  The bioenergetics models will provide a decision support tool for our intended users, who are primarily the technical and management boards of the CVJV, IWJV, LCCs and their numerous federal, state, and NGO partners.

With the development of remote sensing technologies, it is now feasible to gather large amounts of data across the world, including understudied and remote regions. To determine which factors were most important in explaining the variation of chlorophyll a (Chl-a), an indicator of primary production in water bodies, at global and regional scales, we first developed a geospatial database of 227 water bodies and watersheds with corresponding Chl-a, nutrient, hydrogeomorphic, and climate data. Then we used a generalized additive modeling approach and developed model selection criteria to select models that most parsimoniously related Chl-a to predictor variables for all 227 water bodies and for 51 lakes in the Laurentian Great Lakes region in the data set. Our best global model contained two hydrogeomorphic variables (water body surface area and the ratio of watershed to water body surface area) and a climate variable (average temperature in the warmest model selection criteria to select models that most parsimoniously related Chl-a to predictor variables quarter) and explained ~ 30% of variation in Chl-a. Our regional model contained one hydrogeomorphic variable (flow accumulation) and the same climate variable, but explained substantially more variation (58%). Our results indicate that a regional approach to watershed modeling may be more informative to predicting Chl-a, and that nearly a third of global variability in Chl-a may be explained using hydrogeomorphic and climate variables.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["573c7a5fe4b0dae0d5e4aeef"],"contacts":[{"name":"Whitney Woelmer","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"wwoelmer@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Yu-Chun Kao","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"David Bunnell","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"dbunnell@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Andrew M.

The projected changes in climate, vegetation, and&nbsp;species distributions were summarized for the entire study region as well as for specific land management&nbsp;units, including National Parks, state and federal fish and wildlife refuges, and The Nature Conservancy (TNC)&nbsp;owned and managed sites.<\/p>","materialRequestInstructions":"<p>The project has six specific objectives:<\/p> \n<p>(1) Downscaling future climate simulations from 6 coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) to high spatial resolution grids (e.g., 1-km) of the Pacific Northwest.

As a continuation of our inaugural&nbsp;USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC) project, this study examined the effects of climate and land use change on bird&nbsp;populations and their riparian and wetland habitats in the western US. Scientists at the USGS, academic institutions, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) examined the linkages&nbsp;between climate, hydrology, and the biological factors that influence riparian and wetland&nbsp;ecosystem resilience and migratory bird communities. To this end, we (1) collectively developed a&nbsp;synthesis document exploring the linkages between the myriad of elements determining climate&nbsp;change effects on bird communities and communicated this state-of-knowledge to wildlife managers;&nbsp;(2) downscaled data using statistical and dynamical approaches that produce ensemble climate&nbsp;models; (3) developed models to forecast climate effects on water and biological outcomes on&nbsp;wetlands in the northern Great Plains; (4) developed models that relate climate predictions to snowmelt&nbsp;timing, stream flow, water management, and the phenology and growth of native and invasive&nbsp;riparian plants, (5) predicted migrant bird responses to changes in phenology and habitats; and (6)&nbsp;examine the role of phenotypic plasticity in avian responses to climate change. By exploring the&nbsp;effects&nbsp;of altered climate and habitat conditions on riparian-dependent birds using a holistic approach that&nbsp;incorporates both top-down and bottom-up constraints, we can better predict changes in riparian&nbsp;ecosystems and responses of migratory birds to those changes. The results can assist&nbsp;managers and conservation professionals within federal, state, and NGOs who are concerned with protecting migratory bird species and managing riparian invasive species, by&nbsp;addressing all four science goals of the NCCWSC. The project falls under the purview of three&nbsp;USGS Science Strategy strategic directions and three US Climate Change Science Program goals.<\/p>","parentId":"5050cc14e4b0be20bb30eac8","contacts":[{"name":"Susan K Skagen","oldPartyId":9529,"type":"Principal

obligation to provide access to their climate science related research data. We suspect, as with other data types, that tools for creating and editing social science metadata specific to the climate science domain and linking the metadata to the actual data either do not exist or are non-intuitive for scientists. Through our research we sought to verify whether any definitive metadata tool for social scientists working in the climate science domain exists. We also sought to determine whether a commonly agreed upon social science metadata standard exists. We suspect that the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) may be the most appropriate standard. Using a goal-directed design (GDD) approach, we sought to: (1) identify the best practices and approaches (BP&amp;A) used in the social science data management and curation community to meet these intrinsic and process-oriented challenges and create a document that addresses practices based upon roles, i.e., researcher and data steward; (2) measure user behaviors and needs necessary to identify what support services or data collection or processing tools need to be deployed or developed in order to support social science data sharing; and (3) formalize the models as requirements, which will fit into the framework for sharing data established by the NCCWSC.","parentId":"53beaa25e4b0527d5d411803","contacts":[{"name":"Michelle Wiest","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"mwiest@uidaho.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Idaho"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"J.

A shift&nbsp;to a more open science paradigm will require changes on the parts of government agencies, academicinstitutions, funding agencies\/organizations, journals, and the researchers themselves. For example,&nbsp;journals are now beginning to require that data be shared in order for manuscripts to be published in&nbsp;accordance with guidelines created by the Transparency and&nbsp;Openness Promotion (TOP) Committee&nbsp;(Nosek et al.,2015). Major biophysical and social science journals are among the signatories to the TOP&nbsp;guidelines, including Science, American Journal of Political Science, Behavioral Science and Policy,&nbsp;Political Science Research and Methods, Research and Politics, Sociological Science, and Survey&nbsp;Research Methods, among many others (for a full list see:&nbsp;Center for Open Science, 2015&nbsp;). At the&nbsp;institutional level, changes will come in the forms of new&nbsp;policies and, to be effective, will be&nbsp;accompanied by training, tools, and other resources to help researchers meet these new policies. However,&nbsp;on the fundamental level, researchers will need to adopt practices within their own workflow that support&nbsp;open&nbsp;science. In considering such a shift toward open science, current knowledge about the needs,&nbsp;behaviors, and attitudes of researchers can be informative.&nbsp;\n <br> \n <br> The results reported here provide insights on addressing the challenges of data management, sharing,&nbsp;and&nbsp;archiving in an emerging era of public accountability for scientific integration and transparency.&nbsp;The&nbsp;results from this project are&nbsp;organized as follows:&nbsp;We first summarize the characteristics of the interview&nbsp;and&nbsp;survey subjects&nbsp;(see Appendix 1 for&nbsp;a complete methodological description). We then delineate the&nbsp;needs, behaviors and views&nbsp;of the managers&nbsp;and&nbsp;researchers we surveyed&nbsp;or interviewed. &nbsp;Then, we&nbsp;describe current&nbsp;approaches&nbsp;to addressing these needs and meeting federal requirements.

We explored the influence of species traits, host fishes, and habitat at three spatial scales (micro-, reach-, and catchment-scale) on the detection and occupancy of 14 species of freshwater mussels in the Tar River basin, North Carolina. Detection probability for all species was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.36 \u20130.47) with no species- or site-specific detection effects identified. Mean occupancy probability among species ranged from 0.04 (95% CI, 0.01 \u2013 0.16) for Alasmidonta undulata, an undescribed Lampsilis sp., and Strophitus undulatus to 0.67 (95% CI, 0.42 \u2013 0.86) for Elliptio icterina. Median occupancy probability among sites was &lt; 0.30 for all species with the exception of E. icterina, and the maximum predicted occupancy probability for 71% of the species did not exceed 0.50. Catchment-scale abiotic variables (stream power, agricultural land use) and species traits (brood time, host specificity, tribe) influenced the occupancy of mussel assemblages more than reach- or microhabitat-scale features. To further investigate mussel demographics in the Tar River basin, we integrated existing survey records from 1986 \u2013 2011 in a dynamic occupancy model. Results indicated that occupancy probability for 14 species decreased over the study period. Occupancy probability in 1986 ranged from 0.19 for Utterbackia imbecillis to 0.60 for Fusconaia masoni. Occupancy probability at the end of the 26-year study period ranged from 0.10 for Lampsilis radiata to 0.40 for F masoni. The maximum difference between occupancy probability in 1986 and 2011 was 0.30 for Alasmidonta undulata. Mean survival for all species was high (0.97, 95% CI = 0.95 \u2013 0.99). However, the mean colonization probability was very low (&lt; 0.01, 95% CI = &lt; 0.01 \u2013 0.01). These results indicate that mussels persist at sites that they have already occupied, but that they are not colonizing sites where they had not been previously. One particular threat that mussels face with global change is thermal regime alteration. We combined extensive field measurements of temperature in the stream water column and substrate at sites where mussels occur, measures of abundance and species richness for mussels and fish, and current thermal tolerance knowledge for mussels and fish to generate a comprehensive assessment of potential threats mussels face as temperatures continue to rise with global change. Average summer (June \u2013 August, 2010 \u2013 2012) temperatures at mussel-occupied sites in the upper Tar River basin ranged 16.2 \u2013 34.7 &deg;C. The mean temperature from the hottest 96 h at each site ranged 23.5 \u2013 31.5 &deg;C. Temperature threshold exceedance durations indicated that both acute and chronic freshwater mussel thermal tolerance thresholds were met or exceeded. Another primary threat from global change is habitat alteration and degradation. We empirically measured habitat availability and microhabitat use for 10 freshwater mussel species to determine habitat suitability distributions for six microhabitat parameters. Among species, mean water depth of occupied habitats ranged 0.23 \u2013 0.54 m, mean bottom velocity ranged 0.001 \u2013 0.055 m\/s, average mean-column velocity ranged 0 \u2013 0.055 m\/s, and mean substrate penetrability ranged 0.11 \u2013 11.67 on an index scale. The most commonly measured dominant substrate materials were silt, sand, very coarse sand, pea gravel, and coarse gravel. The most commonly associated cover types were coarse woody debris and fine woody debris. We found a relationship between niche breadth and conservation status of a species. Federally endangered A. heterodon consistently showed a narrower suite of suitable microhabitats than the common mussel E. complanata. These findings will enhance the understanding of freshwater mussel ecology and will guide conservation strategies in the face of global change.","parentId":"50748105e4b090654e7b2905","contacts":[{"name":"Tamara J.

The consequences of such mismatches are difficult to link to specific future climate change scenarios because the responses across trophic levels have complex underlying climate drivers often confounded by other stressors. In contrast, seasonal coat color polyphenism creating camouflage against snow is a direct and potentially severe type of seasonal mismatch if crypsis becomes compromised by the animal being white when snow is absent. It is unknown whether plasticity in the initiation or rate of coat color change will be able to reduce mismatch between the seasonal coat color and an increasingly snow-free background. We find that natural populations of snowshoe hares exposed to 3 y of widely varying snowpack have plasticity in the rate of the spring white-to-brown molt, but not in either the initiation dates of color change or the rate of the fall brown-to-white molt. Using an ensemble of locally downscaled climate projections, we also show that annual average duration of snowpack is forecast to decrease by 29\u201335 d by midcentury and 40\u201369 d by the end of the century. Without evolution in coat color phenology, the reduced snow duration will increase the number of days that white hares will be mismatched on a snowless background by four- to eightfold by the end of the century.

Connecting Downscaled Climate Models to Adaptation for a Key Forest Species","body":"<p>Existing high resolution climate models have not yet specifically connected&nbsp;ecologically relevant downscaled climate drivers to on-the-ground responses for wildlife species.&nbsp;This project uniquely addressed, in a comprehensive package, the linkage between downscaled,&nbsp;high-resolution climate models and the consequences of specific climate drivers on species and&nbsp;ecosystem-level adaptation. Snowshoe hares are the high-profile prey of the Federally&nbsp;Threatened Canada Lynx; in fact, hares are critical players in forest ecosystems, because most&nbsp;carnivores prey on them. Like many other species in temperate ecosystems (e.g. arctic foxes,&nbsp;weasels, ptarmigan), hares undergo a seasonal coat color molt to match the presence or absence&nbsp;of snow. Because a reduced duration of snowpack is the strongest signal of climate change in&nbsp;temperate regions, and because mismatch (white coat on non-snowy background) is likely to lead&nbsp;to high predation-induced mortality, the climate factors that make this species vulnerable to rapid&nbsp;decline are starkly clear. On the other hand, any species may respond to climate change by&nbsp;adapting or moving. This project provides wildlife managers with the first case study to&nbsp;connect field measurements of responses (adapt, move, or decline) to downscaled climate maps&nbsp;at ecologically relevant scales.<\/p>","parentId":"5050cc14e4b0be20bb30eac8","contacts":[{"name":"Michael S Mitchell","oldPartyId":7069,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"mike.mitchell@umontana.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Montana"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"L.

We focused on five species of mammals&nbsp;in the alpine zone of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, including the federally endangered&nbsp;Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep and the American pika, a species recently proposed for listing&nbsp;due to the&nbsp;loss of populations from altered climatic conditions. It is expected that there will be&nbsp;an upward expansion of trees and shrubs from lower elevations and that many or even most&nbsp;alpine meadows will be converted to woody dominated communities. Meadows provide critical&nbsp;habitat for many alpine mammal species, and their conversion could represent a major loss with&nbsp;severe consequences for the long-term persistence of these species. However, it is currently&nbsp;unknown whether the severity of the effects of meadow conversion on alpine mammals would be&nbsp;uniform or species-specific; all species could be impacted similarly; some species could be&nbsp;unaffected; or species currently not considered at risk may be seriously impacted. Moreover,&nbsp;while climate could potentially trigger changes in alpine vegetation communities, herbivorous&nbsp;and granivorous mammals could mediate the magnitude and extent of meadow conversion&nbsp;through their consumption of woody seeds and seedlings. In other words, feedbacks between&nbsp;climate and alpine mammals could result in the mammals \u201cmanaging their own habitat.\u201d&nbsp;Presently though, very little is known about vegetation or mammal communities in the alpine&nbsp;zone of the Sierra Nevada, especially in relation to climate change. Consequently, resource&nbsp;management agencies are seriously hindered in development of justifiable, long-term&nbsp;management strategies for bighorn sheep, pika, and other alpine mammals. To answer these questions, we modeled (1) the range shifts for five alpine mammal species and (2) the degree to which plant-animal interactions may alter what is often assumed to be an inevitable, climatically driven transition of alpine meadows to woody dominated communities in the Sierra Nevada.<\/p>","parentId":"5050cc14e4b0be20bb30eac8","contacts":[{"name":"Robert C Klinger","oldPartyId":5561,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"rcklinger@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Ecologist","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"C","lastName":"Klinger","organization":{"displayText":"Yosemite Field Station, WERC"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"2093791116","officePhone":"7608735125","streetAddress":{"zip":"93644","city":"Oakhurst","state":"CA","line1":"40298 Junction Drive"},"buildingCode":"WBI","name":"Robert C Klinger\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

Abstract:&nbsp;\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.231;\">In ecological studies, it is useful to estimate the probability that a species occurs at given locations. The probability of presence can be modeled by traditional statistical methods, if both presence and absence data are available. However, the challenge is that most species records contain only presence data, without reliable absence data. Previous presence-only methods can estimate a relative index of habitat suitability, but cannot estimate the actual probability of presence.<\/span> \n<div>\n  &nbsp;\n<\/div> \n<div>\n  In this study, we develop a presence and background learning algorithm (PBL) that is successful in modeling the conditional probability of presence of a simulated species. The model is trained by two completely separate sets: observed presence and background data. Assuming that the probability of presence is one for \u2018prototypical presence\u2019 locations where the habitats are maximally suitable for a species, we can estimate a constant that can calibrate the trained model into the actual probability of presence. Experimental results show that the PBL method performs similarly to a presence-absence method, and significantly better than the widely used maximum entropy method. The new algorithm enables us to model the probability that a species occurs conditional on environmental covariates without absence data. Hence, it has potential to improve modeling of the geographical distributions of species.\n<\/div>","parentId":"507467aae4b090654e7b27ba","webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1600-0587.2011.06888.x\/abstract","title":"Li et al., 2011","hidden":false}],"dates":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-07-17T11:00:23.211-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2013-07-17T11:00:23.211-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0"},"513e1090e4b07b9dc9e7e9bf":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/4f8339eee4b0e84f608680ad","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Chapter 11: Avian communities in tidal salt marshes of San Francisco Bay: a review of functional groups by foraging guild and habitat association","relatedTitle":"Fate of Endangered Species in San Francisco Bay Tidal Marshes with Sea Level Rise","id":"513e1090e4b07b9dc9e7e9bf","relatedId":"4f8339eee4b0e84f608680ad","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/513e1090e4b07b9dc9e7e9bf","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Fate of Endangered Species in San Francisco Bay Tidal Marshes with Sea Level Rise","relatedTitle":"Chapter 11: Avian communities in tidal salt marshes of San Francisco Bay: a review of functional groups by foraging guild and habitat association","id":"4f8339eee4b0e84f608680ad","relatedId":"513e1090e4b07b9dc9e7e9bf","annotation":null}]},"id":"513e1090e4b07b9dc9e7e9bf","title":"Chapter 11: Avian communities in tidal salt marshes of San Francisco Bay: a review of functional groups by foraging guild and habitat association","parentId":"50782a12e4b0df5513bf60f9","webLinks":[{"typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.werc.usgs.gov\/ProductDetails.aspx?ID=4861","title":"A Profile of the San Francisco Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve","hidden":false}],"dates":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-03-11T11:12:48.449-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2013-03-11T11:12:48.449-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0"},"513e118de4b07b9dc9e7e9c2":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/4f8339eee4b0e84f608680ad","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Chapter 12: Bird communities: effects of fragmentation, disturbance, and sea level rise on population viability","relatedTitle":"Fate of Endangered Species in San Francisco Bay Tidal Marshes with Sea Level Rise","id":"513e118de4b07b9dc9e7e9c2","relatedId":"4f8339eee4b0e84f608680ad","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/513e118de4b07b9dc9e7e9c2","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Fate of Endangered Species in San Francisco Bay Tidal Marshes with Sea Level Rise","relatedTitle":"Chapter 12: Bird communities: effects of fragmentation, disturbance, and sea level rise on population viability","id":"4f8339eee4b0e84f608680ad","relatedId":"513e118de4b07b9dc9e7e9c2","annotation":null}]},"id":"513e118de4b07b9dc9e7e9c2","title":"Chapter 12: Bird communities: effects of fragmentation, disturbance, and sea level rise on population viability","body":"[Excerpt from Introduction] &quot;The San Francisco Bay Estuary supports a large and diverse bird community.

While a complete climate prediction may be intractable at this time -- for instance, the climate projections may not incorporate land use changes and solar fluctuations into the boundary conditions --&nbsp;we proposed a framework to quantify known uncertainty that is also flexible enough to adapt to advances in climate predictions. A key advantage of the hierarchical approach is that it incorporates various sources of observations and includes established scientific knowledge, and uncertainties associated with each. This work is critical for monitoring effects of climate change since lakes and streams have been identified as sentinels of environmental change. The proposed hierarchical modeling approach should help to account for these uncertainties, in particular variability of relevant climate conditions across temporal and spatial scales, so forecasts of community or population response to a given climate change scenario include realistic measures of uncertainty. The approach combined available data from numerous agencies (e.g., US Geological Survey, US&nbsp;Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the US&nbsp;Fish and Wildlife Service) and models (e.g., North American Regional Climate Change Program and sturgeon population, movement, and bioenergetics model) across a variety of scales. This work provides the framework for describing the potential consequences of global climate changes on large riverine ecosystems, alerting decision-makers to the most likely consequences, and producing a new suite of indicators of large riverine ecosystem change and health. The project also provides explicit means for scaling results up or down multiple hierarchical levels and associated uncertainty.

However, the ability of species to moderate the impacts of climate change (i.e., adaptive capacity) is an important factor to consider when assessing vulnerability. Organisms can possess traits that allow them to move to areas of favorable habitat or alter their phenotypes in response to varying environmental conditions. Additionally, traits can adapt over multiple generations through evolutionary processes. Recent evidence suggests that evolutionary adaptive capacity (EVAC) can occur over shorter time periods than originally thought and tools to measure and predict evolutionary changes are becoming increasingly available. However, accounting for EVAC in climate change vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning is uncommon and resource managers often make decisions without considering the potential evolvability of species. The purpose of this work is to help bridge the gap between the science and management communities by highlighting examples of EVAC that have resulted from changing climate conditions and providing insights on how relevant scientific information can be fed into policy and planning activities. This work will foster a two-way communication that provides equal importance to what scientists can learn from managers and what managers can learn from scientists, increasing the likelihood of knowledge uptake by the decision-making community. The specific objectives are to 1) illustrate the importance of EVAC and its interaction with other forms of adaptive capacity for understanding vulnerability of organisms, 2) identify common barriers that managers encounter with regards to assessing and making decisions related to EVAC, 3) provide knowledge that could serve as a solution for overcoming barriers, and 4) identify knowledge gaps where future research is needed to inform key management questions.<\/div>\n","parentId":"5703c926e4b0328dcb822b49","contacts":[{"name":"Laura M Thompson","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"lthompson@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Biologist","firstName":"Laura","middleName":"M","lastName":"Thompson","organization":{"displayText":"National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"7036484044","officePhone":"7036484083","streetAddress":{"zip":"20192","city":"Reston","state":"VA","line1":"12201 Sunrise Valley Dr"},"buildingCode":"AAA","name":"Laura M Thompson\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

The multiple drivers that affect lake sport fisheries, along with the complex interactions within lakes, make it difficult to forecast changes in sport fisheries and plan adaptive responses to build resilience of these important resources.&nbsp;Resilience involves managing with an eye toward critical thresholds for behavior of ecosystems. Project researchers are working to develop quantitative tools for assessment of thresholds in sport fisheries that can be used by management agencies to evaluate potential impacts of climate change mediated through species and habitat interactions. Several outputs of the project will be adaptable to other assessments of resilience of sport fisheries, including bioenergetics and ecosystem models to assess thresholds; delineation of Thresholds of Concern for regional sport fisheries subject to changing climate, land use and angling effort; and assessments of the capacity of management tools to alter critical thresholds for sport fisheries. To focus the work, the research team is addressing thresholds for replacement of cool-water sport fish by warm-water sport fish, using the specific example of walleye and bass in the Upper Midwestern U.S. Climate change has obvious implications for transitions between thermal guilds, but details of species interactions, changes in nearshore habitat, invasive species, angler behavior, regulations or many other factors are likely to affect the thresholds for transition between cool and warm water fishes and we will address these complex interactions.&nbsp;","parentId":"5050cc22e4b0be20bb30eacc","contacts":[{"name":"Steve Carpenter","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"srcarpen@wisc.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Wisconsin"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jake Vander Zanden","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"mjvanderzand@wisc.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Wisconsin"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jon Hansen","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Gretchen Hansen","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Joseph Hennessey","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Steve Hewett","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Daniel Iserman","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"John Lyons","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"NCCWSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Label","name":"2011"},{"type":"Label","name":"NCCWSC"},{"type":"Label","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"NCCWSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2011"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2011-04","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2015-04","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-12-20T08:20:30.939-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-27T02:40:02.331-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"}],"files":[{"imageWidth":2994,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":856078,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-02-10T18:25:14.000Z","name":"NCCW-2011-2_Walleye_GretchenHansen1.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__28\/45\/a2\/2845a2c2a163fc9b4dcdcb8d5f7b9d175007adf5","title":"Walleye -

In this synthesis, we (1) summarize climate trends that may influence North American inland fish populations and assemblages, (2) compile 31 peer-reviewed studies of documented climate change effects on North American inland fish populations and assemblages, and (3) highlight four case studies representing a variety of observed responses ranging from warmwater systems in the southwestern and southeastern United States to coldwater systems along the Pacific Coast and Canadian Shield.

We show that declining snowpack strengthens the impacts of a generalist herbivore, elk ( \n<em>Cervus elaphus<\/em>), on a common tree species. Thick snowpack substantially reduces elk visitation to sites; aspen ( \n<em>Populus tremuloides<\/em>) shoots in these areas experience lower browsing rates, higher survival and enhanced recruitment. Aspen inside herbivore exclosures have greatly increased recruitment, particularly at sites with thick snowpack. We suggest that long-term decreases in snowpack could help explain a widespread decline of aspen through previously unconsidered relationships. More generally, reduced snowpack across the Rocky Mountains, combined with rising elk populations, may remove the conditions needed for recruitment of this ecologically important tree species. These results highlight that herbivore behavioural responses to altered abiotic conditions are critical determinants of plant persistence. Predictions of climate change impacts must not overlook the crucial importance of species interactions.","parentId":"507465dee4b090654e7b2782","contacts":[{"name":"Jedediah

Here, we quantify the relationship between 121 indicators of mean and extreme temperature and precipitation and 24 water quality parameters in 57 Texas reservoirs using observational data records covering the period 1960 to 2010. We find that water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductance, chloride, sulfate, and phosphorus all show consistent correlations with atmospheric predictors, including high and low temperature extremes, dry days, heavy precipitation events, and mean temperature and precipitation over time scales ranging from one week to two years. Based on this analysis and published future projections for this region, we expect climate change to increase water temperatures, decrease dissolved oxygen levels, decrease pH, increase specific conductance, and increase levels of sulfate, chloride in Texas reservoirs. Over decadal time scales, this may affect aquatic ecosystems in the reservoirs, including altering the risk of conditions conducive to algae occurrence, as well as affecting the quality of water available for human consumption and recreation.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["507480c2e4b090654e7b28f2"],"contacts":[{"name":"Rodica Gelca","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Katharine Hayhoe","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Ian Scott-Fleming","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Caleb Crow","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"D.

The Northwest Climate Science Center (NW CSC), the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC), the Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, and the University of Idaho's Northwest Knowledge Network (NKN) worked to identify the indigenous knowledge and practices of the Schitsu'umsh people that underlie their interactions with the historically dynamic environment of the Palouse, a major Northwest agricultural area. This pilot project inventoried and organized traditional indigenous knowledge (TEK) and contextual information (metadata) while developing a set of best practices for tribal-governmental collaborative ethnographic and scientific research. Products can be modified and expanded for other tribal and non-tribal communities throughout the United States as they address the social and environmental effects of climate change.","parentId":"531899cce4b051b1b924ea01","linkParentIds":["53beaa25e4b0527d5d411803"],"contacts":[{"name":"Rodney Frey","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"rfrey@uidaho.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Idaho"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jeremy Kenyon","oldPartyId":61144,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jkenyon@uidaho.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Kenyon","organization":{"displayText":"University of Idaho"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Leanne Campbell","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"lvcampbell@cdatribe-nsn.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"NCCWSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Brian Cleveley","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"cbc@uidaho.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Idaho"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Steven Daley-Laursen","oldPartyId":60842,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"stevendl@uidaho.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Daley-Laursen","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Marisa L Guarinello","oldPartyId":28114,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from FPPS data from 1992 through 2009.","firstName":"Marisa","middleName":"L","lastName":"Guarinello","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Label","name":"Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe"},{"type":"Label","name":"Northwest Knowledge Network"},{"type":"Label","name":"traditional indigenous knowledge"},{"type":"Label","name":"Palouse"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Location","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Location","name":"Northwest"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"NCCWSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Northwest CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-07-11","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2015-08-31","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-09-16T10:33:44.320-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-27T05:42:44.127-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"Completed","facetName":"Project","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":18000,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2014","_class":"AnnualBudget","fundingSources":[{"amount":18000,"_class":"FundingSource","source":"NW CSC"}],"totalFunds":18000}]},{"facetName":"Expando","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ExpandoFacet"}],"files":[{"imageWidth":910,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":198592,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2016-02-11T20:50:45.000Z","name":"NCCW-2014-6_MudLake_ID_AlanCressler.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__de\/75\/22\/de75228287d4cd7dbf6025ef80897e800b8438b8","title":"Mud Lake, Idaho -

In theory, the identification of climatic, biotic, or demographic influences on reproductive success assists fisheries management by identifying factors that have a direct and reproducible influence on the population dynamics of a target species. More often, models are constructed as one-time studies of a single population whose results are not revisited when further data become available. Here, we present results from stock recruitment models for Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus and Bloater Coregonus hoyi in Lakes Michigan and Huron. The factors that explain variation in Bloater recruitment were remarkably consistent across populations and with previous studies that found Bloater recruitment to be linked to population demographic patterns in Lake Michigan. Conversely, our models were poor predictors of Alewife recruitment in Lake Huron but did show some agreement with previously published models from Lake Michigan. Overall, our results suggest that external predictors of fish recruitment are difficult to discern using traditional fisheries models, and reproducing the results from previous studies may be difficult particularly at low population sizes.","parentId":"507468aee4b090654e7b27e6","webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/00028487.2013.833986#.UvpfUqXkuno","title":"Collingsworth et al., 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013-12","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-02-11T10:35:43.418-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2014-02-11T10:35:43.418-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Transactions of the American Fisheries Societies","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI Number","value":"10.1080\/00028487.2013.833986"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0"},"53c810fbe4b019484164257c":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/4f833bd0e4b0e84f608680be","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Comparison of elevation and remote sensing derived products as auxiliary data for climate surface interpolation","relatedTitle":"Can Mammals Mediate Climatically-Induced Vegetation Transitions in Alpine Ecosystems of the Western United States?","id":"53c810fbe4b019484164257c","relatedId":"4f833bd0e4b0e84f608680be","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/53c810fbe4b019484164257c","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Can Mammals Mediate Climatically-Induced Vegetation Transitions in Alpine Ecosystems of the Western United States?","relatedTitle":"Comparison of elevation and remote sensing derived products as auxiliary data for climate surface interpolation","id":"4f833bd0e4b0e84f608680be","relatedId":"53c810fbe4b019484164257c","annotation":null}]},"id":"53c810fbe4b019484164257c","title":"Comparison of elevation and remote sensing derived products as auxiliary data for climate surface interpolation","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/joc.3835\/abstract):&nbsp; \n<span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size:12px\">Climate models may be limited in their inferential use if they cannot be locally validated or do not account for spatial uncertainty. Much of the focus has gone into determining which interpolation method is best suited for creating gridded climate surfaces, which often a covariate such as elevation (Digital Elevation Model, DEM) is used to improve the interpolation accuracy. One key area where little research has addressed is in determining which covariate best improves the accuracy in the interpolation. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation was carried out in determining which covariates were most suitable for interpolating climatic variables (e.g. precipitation, mean temperature, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature). We compiled data for each climate variable from 1950 to 1999 from approximately 500 weather stations across the Western United States (32&deg; to 49&deg; latitude and \u2212124.7&deg; to \u2212112.9&deg; longitude). In addition, we examined the uncertainty of the interpolated climate surface. Specifically, Thin Plate Spline (TPS) was used as the interpolation method since it is one of the most popular interpolation techniques to generate climate surfaces. We considered several covariates, including DEM, slope, distance to coast (Euclidean distance), aspect, solar potential, radar, and two Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). A tenfold cross-validation was applied to determine the uncertainty of the interpolation based on each covariate. In general, the leading covariate for precipitation was radar, while DEM was the leading covariate for maximum, mean, and minimum temperatures. A comparison to other products such as PRISM and WorldClim showed strong agreement across large geographic areas but climate surfaces generated in this study (ClimSurf) had greater variability at high elevation regions, such as in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.<\/span>","parentId":"507467aae4b090654e7b27ba","contacts":[{"name":"Alvarez, Otto","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":""},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Guo, Qinghua","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":""},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Klinger, Robert C","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":""},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Li, Wenkai","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":""},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Doherty, Paul","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":""},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","organization":{"displayText":""},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/joc.3835\/abstract","title":"Abstract Text Link","hidden":false},{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/joc.3835\/full","title":"Full Text Link","hidden":false},{"type":"pdf","typeLabel":"PDF Download","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/joc.3835\/pdf","title":"Publication PDF","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"climate surfaces"},{"name":"spatial interpolation"},{"name":"temperature"},{"name":"precipitation"},{"name":"Thin Plate Spline"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-06","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-07-17T12:07:55.733-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2014-07-17T12:13:58.356-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"International Journal of Climatology","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1002\/joc.3835"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"startPage","value":"2258"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issn","value":"1097-0088"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issue","value":"7"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"endPage","value":"2268"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"volume","value":"34"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","people":["Alvarez, Otto","Guo, Qinghua","Klinger, Robert C","Li, Wenkai","Doherty, Paul"],"orgs":["John Wiley & Sons, Ltd"]},"5134f686e4b0e1603e4fecdf":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/4f833af3e4b0e84f608680b6","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Comparison of Small-Mammal Sampling Techniques in Tidal Salt Marshes of the Central Gulf Coast of Florida","relatedTitle":"How will Florida\u2019s Biodiversity Respond to Climate Change?","id":"5134f686e4b0e1603e4fecdf","relatedId":"4f833af3e4b0e84f608680b6","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5134f686e4b0e1603e4fecdf","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"How will Florida\u2019s Biodiversity Respond to Climate Change?","relatedTitle":"Comparison of Small-Mammal Sampling Techniques in Tidal Salt Marshes of the Central Gulf Coast of Florida","id":"4f833af3e4b0e84f608680b6","relatedId":"5134f686e4b0e1603e4fecdf","annotation":null}]},"id":"5134f686e4b0e1603e4fecdf","title":"Comparison of Small-Mammal Sampling Techniques in Tidal Salt Marshes of the Central Gulf Coast of Florida","body":"This publication is a product of the project \"A Land of Flowers on a Latitude of Deserts: Aiding Conservation and Management of Florida\u2019s Biodiversity\".","parentId":"507466bce4b090654e7b278d","contacts":[{"name":"Melissa A.

Determining how changes in the abundance and distribution of grass and woody plants are influenced by conditions that regulate water availability at a regional scale provides a baseline to compare how management actions alter the composition of these vegetation types at a more local scale and can be used to predict future shifts under climate change. Using a remote-sensing-based approach, we assessed the balance between grasses and woody plants and how climate and topo-edaphic conditions affected their abundances across the northern Sonoran Desert from 1989 to 2009. Despite widespread woody plant encroachment in this region over the last 150&nbsp;years, we found that leguminous trees, including mesquite (<em>Prosopis<\/em>&nbsp;spp.), declined in cover in areas with prolonged drying conditions during the early 21st century. Creosote bush (<em>Larrea tridentata<\/em>) also had moderate decreases with prolonged drying but was buffered from changes on soils with low clay that promote infiltration and high available water capacity that allows for retention of water at depth. Perennial grasses have expanded and contracted over the last two decades in response to summer precipitation and were especially dynamic on shallow soils with high clay that have large fluctuations in water availability. Our results suggest that topo-edaphic properties can amplify or ameliorate climate-induced changes in woody plants and perennial grasses. Understanding these relationships has important implications for ecosystem function under climate change in the southwestern USA and can inform management efforts to regulate grass and woody plant abundances.","parentId":"551afb44e4b03238427838f0","contacts":[{"name":"Seth M Munson","oldPartyId":13527,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"smunson@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Seth","middleName":"M","lastName":"Munson","organization":{"displayText":"Canyonlands Field Station, SBSC"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9285569111","officePhone":"9285237740","streetAddress":{"zip":"86011","city":"Flagstaff","state":"AZ","line1":"Po Box 5614 Bldg 56"},"buildingCode":"WZI","name":"Seth M Munson\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"84532","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"980","city":"Moab","state":"UT","line1":"2290 S.

Monilifera) from the Northern Great Plains, USA","body":"Abstract:&nbsp;A new 368-year tree-ring chronology (A.D. 1643-2010) has been developed in western North Dakota using plains cottonwood (Populus deltoides subsp. monilifera) growing on the relatively undisturbed floodplain of the Little Missouri River in the North Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. We document many slow-growing living trees between 150-370 years old that contradict the common understanding that cottonwoods grow fast and die young. In this northern location, cottonwood produces distinct annual rings with dramatic interannual variability that strongly crossdate. The detrended tree-ring chronology is significantly positively correlated with local growing season precipitation and soil moisture conditions (r = 0.69). This time series shows periods of prolonged low radial tree growth during the known droughts of the instrumental record (e.g. 1931-1939 and 1980-1981) and also during prehistory (e.g. 1816-1823 and 1856-1865) when other paleoclimate studies have documented droughts in this region. Tree rings of cottonwood will be a useful tool to help reconstruct climate, streamflow, and the floodplain history of the Little Missouri River and other northern river systems.","parentId":"50746778e4b090654e7b27af","webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/abs\/10.3959\/1536-1098-70.1.21","title":"Edmondson et al., 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-01-01","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-02-14T10:09:37.915-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-12-02T09:25:07.552-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Tree-Ring Research","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI Number","value":"10.3959\/1536-1098-70.1.21"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0"},"544947aee4b0f888a81bb4df":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"544947aee4b0f888a81bb4df","title":"Density Estimates by Species","parentId":"507467b1e4b090654e7b27bc","systemTypes":["Folder"],"dates":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-10-23T12:23:42.962-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-26T17:43:10.541-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=544947aee4b0f888a81bb4df&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=544947aee4b0f888a81bb4df&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=544947aee4b0f888a81bb4df&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=544947aee4b0f888a81bb4df","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/544947aee4b0f888a81bb4df\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""}],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0"},"54494827e4b0f888a81bb4e1":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/4f833bd0e4b0e84f608680be","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Density Estimates from Line Transect Sampling (individuals per km^2)","relatedTitle":"Can Mammals Mediate Climatically-Induced Vegetation Transitions in Alpine Ecosystems of the Western United States?","id":"54494827e4b0f888a81bb4e1","relatedId":"4f833bd0e4b0e84f608680be","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/54494827e4b0f888a81bb4e1","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Can Mammals Mediate Climatically-Induced Vegetation Transitions in Alpine Ecosystems of the Western United States?","relatedTitle":"Density Estimates from Line Transect Sampling (individuals per km^2)","id":"4f833bd0e4b0e84f608680be","relatedId":"54494827e4b0f888a81bb4e1","annotation":null}]},"id":"54494827e4b0f888a81bb4e1","title":"Density Estimates from Line Transect Sampling (individuals per km^2)","body":"Density estimates of four mammal species in the upper subalpine and alpine zones of the Sierra Nevada range, 2008 - 2012.

This need is especially pressing in the context of climate change: climate change is expected to affect migratory bird habitat and populations in multiple ways, and a mechanistic understanding of how demographic rates are related to climate variables will help managers to better anticipate and manage these changes. The Institute for Bird Populations (IBP) will address these questions by using data from MAPS (Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship), the longest running continent-wide monitoring program to provide information on migratory bird demographics (recruitment, survival, immigration, and emigration). Data collected through MAPS is used to clarify the factors driving population declines; to determine priority areas to target for conservation and restoration; and to clarify relationships between demographic trends and environmental factors. By combining MAPS data with additional data sources on climate variables, population trends, and occupancy data, researchers at IBP will collaborate with the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center to develop a climate-informed integrated population model. Producing such a model will allow for a clearer understanding of how climate change is likely to affect species survival by clarifying relationships between climate variables and demographic parameters. Ultimately, this research will provide the management community with a mechanistic understanding of how climate change may impact migratory bird population levels and ultimately species survival.","parentId":"5703c926e4b0328dcb822b49","contacts":[{"name":"NCCWSC","type":"Funding Agency","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Climate and Land Use Change Mission Area","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/USGSOrg\/ClimateandLandUseChange","name":"National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center"},{"type":"Taxon","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/WERC\/Taxon","name":"Birds"},{"type":"Research Topics","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/WERC\/ResearchTopics","name":"Climate Change"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"NCCWSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2016"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2016-09-01","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2018-08-31","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2017-01-10T08:27:07.202-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2017-01-13T09:21:48.805-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Number","value":"G16AC00424"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":28000,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2016","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":28000}]}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=5874fd4be4b0a829a320beb8&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=5874fd4be4b0a829a320beb8&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=5874fd4be4b0a829a320beb8&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=5874fd4be4b0a829a320beb8","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5874fd4be4b0a829a320beb8\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""}],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","projectStatus":"In Progress","funding_years":"2016","fy":"2016"},"568add3ce4b0e7594ee76bb9":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"568add3ce4b0e7594ee76bb9","title":"Developing New Strategies for the Global Assessment of Inland Fisheries and Predicting the Response of Inland Fisheries to Regional Climate Change","body":"Despite the important effects of inland fisheries on food, economy, and ecosystem services throughout the world, no comprehensive understanding on the status or key drivers of inland fisheries exists (Beard et al. 2011). Our lack of knowledge regarding the status results from the common belief that inland fishery harvests are widely under reported (FAO 2009; Welcomme et al. 2010), particularly the contributions from recreational, artisanal, and illegal fisheries (FAO 2003; Allan et al. 2005). Overcoming this knowledge gap has no simple solution, given that resources to conduct on-the-ground fisheries assessments are lacking throughout much of the world, particularly in Africa or Asia where the majority of the inland fisheries harvest for subsistence and commercial purposes occurs (FAO 2003). At the local level, the lack of reliable data on the status of fish populations constrains the ability of managers to intervene when fisheries are in decline, until the system has virtually collapsed. It is worth reemphasizing that sustainable inland fisheries are essential in the battle towards poverty eradication and improved nutrition in many of the least developed countries, and that poverty eradication is one of the key Millennium Development Goals set forth by the United Nations. Inland systems also will be vulnerable to changes in climate and land use in the coming century (Ficke et al. 2007; Brander 2007), and knowledge gaps in status and function of inland fisheries will exacerbate the inability of managers to mitigate climate-induced changes in fish populations. Relative to marine systems, habitats in inland systems will likely be more influenced by changes in precipitation patterns (and water levels) and thermal structure, and landlocked inland fish species likely have less ability to migrate to optimal water temperatures. A recent FAO study revealed the economies of western and central Africa (many of which rely exclusively on inland fish production) to be most vulnerable to climate change effects on fisheries (FAO 2006).","purpose":"We aim to develop tools to narrow existing knowledge gaps on the status and key drivers of inland fisheries, given their importance in providing food and a means for poverty alleviation for people in developing countries and in driving economies in developed countries. By providing models that provide potentially less biased estimates of fish production as well as some key variables that could predict fish production, managers would have better information to both manage these key fisheries and their allied ecosystems presently and prepare for the effective governance of these resources in the face of future local and global climate, land and water induced changes.","parentId":"5050cc22e4b0be20bb30eacc","contacts":[{"name":"William W.

We developed and compared two indices to assess the vulnerability of stream fish in Missouri, USA based on species environmental tolerances, rarity, range size, dispersal ability and on the average connectivity of the streams occupied by each species. These two indices differed in how environmental tolerance was classified (i.e., vulnerability to habitat alteration, changes in stream temperature, and changes to flow regimes). Environmental tolerance was classified based on measured species responses to habitat alteration, and extremes in stream temperatures and flow conditions for one index, while environmental tolerance for the second index was based on species\u2019 traits. The indices were compared to determine if vulnerability scores differed by index or state listing status. We also evaluated the spatial distribution of species classified as vulnerable to habitat alteration, changes in stream temperature, and change in flow regimes. Vulnerability scores were calculated for all 133 species with the trait association index, while only 101 species were evaluated using the species response index, because 32 species lacked data to analyze for a response. Scores from the trait association index were greater than the species response index. This is likely due to the species response index's inability to evaluate many rare species, which generally had high vulnerability scores for the trait association index. The indices were consistent in classifying vulnerability to habitat alteration, but varied in their classification of vulnerability due to increases in stream temperature and alterations to flow regimes, likely because extremes in current climate may not fully capture future conditions and their influence on stream fish communities. Both indices showed higher mean vulnerability scores for listed species than unlisted species, which provided a coarse measure of validation. Our indices classified species identified as being in need of conservation by the state of Missouri as highly vulnerable. The distribution of vulnerable species in Missouri showed consistent patterns between indices, with the more forest-dominated, groundwater fed streams in the Ozark subregion generally having higher numbers and proportions of vulnerable species per site than subregions that were agriculturally dominated with more overland flow. These results suggest that both indices will identify similar habitats as conservation action targets despite discrepancies in the classification of vulnerable species. Our vulnerability assessment provides a framework that can be refined and used in other regions.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["542afbd9e4b057766eed290a"],"contacts":[{"name":"Nicholas A.

For this reason, the first step in assessing the impacts of climate change\u2014on a species or an ecosystem, on water resources, or on an aspect of human society such as energy demand or agriculture\u2014is often to develop projections of how temperature, precipitation, and other important aspects of climate might be expected to change in the future at the location of interest.\n<br> \n<br> Global climate models produce future climate projections that are usually too coarse to capture the local characteristics that determine climate at any given location: the proximity of that location to a large body of water, for example, which would moderate extreme temperatures; or whether the location is in the arid \u201crain shadow\u201d of a mountain.\n<br> \n<br> In this project, we used an advanced statistical downscaling method that combines high-\u00adresolution observations with outputs from 16 different global climate models based on four future emission scenarios to generate the most comprehensive dataset of daily temperature and precipitation projections available for climate change impacts in the U.S. The gridded dataset covers the continental U.S., southern Canada, and northern Mexico at one-\u00adeighth degree resolution, and Alaska at one-\u00adhalf degree resolution. We also quality-\u00adcontrolled observations from over 10,000 long-\u00adterm weather stations and generated projections for each of these locations.\n<br> \n<br> The high-\u00adresolution projections produced by this work have been rigorously quality-controlled for both errors and biases in the global climate and statistical downscaling models. We also calculated projected future changes in a broad range of impact-\u00adrelevant indicators, from seasonal temperature to extreme precipitation days. The results of the error and bias tests and the indicator calculations were made available as part of this database.&nbsp;","parentId":"5074680ae4b090654e7b27d0","contacts":[{"name":"Katharine Hayhoe","oldPartyId":15980,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"katharine.hayhoe@ttu.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Katharine","lastName":"Hayhoe","organization":{"displayText":"Texas Tech University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"global climate models"},{"name":"Geo Data Portal"},{"name":"downscaled climate projections"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013-03-22","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-09-02T14:08:14.825-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-02-18T10:08:06.588-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Final Report","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":74892892,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2014-09-02T20:20:42.000Z","name":"Hayhoe_USGS_downscaled_database_final_report_2013.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__4b\/54\/98\/4b5498f4a5365e2623c00a477438ebe3d30459fb","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/540623aee4b0971c80c983a3?f=__disk__4b%2F54%2F98%2F4b5498f4a5365e2623c00a477438ebe3d30459fb"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/540623aee4b0971c80c983a3","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"DevelopmentandD.zip","files":""}],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","people":["Katharine Hayhoe"]},"4f833ee9e4b0e84f608680df":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"4f833ee9e4b0e84f608680df","title":"Development and Dissemination of High-Resolution National Climate Change Dataset (Geo Data Portal)","body":"<p>This project brought together a team of researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)&nbsp;and universities to develop a comprehensive web-based dataset of high-resolution (or \u2018downscaled\u2019)&nbsp;climate change projections, to enable scientists and decision-makers to better assess climate&nbsp;related ecosystem impacts.&nbsp;Currently,&nbsp;scientists and resource managers often find it difficult to&nbsp;use downscaled climate projections because of the multiple methodologies used to produce them&nbsp;and the time-consuming process required to obtain model output. In response, the research team&nbsp;implemented a three-part plan to provide high resolution climate data for the impact modeling&nbsp;community. First, a database was developed of up-to-date and state-of-the-art downscaled&nbsp;climate projections for the U.S., using a range of plausible future greenhouse gas emission&nbsp;scenarios. Second, a series of workshops were held to solicit input about climate-related data&nbsp;needs and to discuss best practices for accessing and using downscaled climate projections.&nbsp;Finally, downscaled projections were made available as an enterprise-level web-based source.&nbsp;Users are able to freely access the data via an interactive, easily manageable interface, in&nbsp;formats which are familiar to ecosystem and impact modelers. The climate dataset was generated by applying advanced statistical downscaling methods to a comprehensive selection of&nbsp;global climate model simulations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment (IPCC AR4) database, with the capability of rapidly&nbsp;updating results as new climate model output becomes available. The workshops involved key stakeholders from the USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC) modeling community and decision-makers and managers&nbsp;from the USGS and our partnering Department of the Interior&nbsp;agencies, such as the US&nbsp;Fish and Wildlife Service&nbsp;and the National Park Service.&nbsp;This project: (1) allows for consistent impact assessments at the scale of the most critical&nbsp;ecosystem processes through downscaling projections of daily temperature and precipitation&nbsp;across the continental U.S.; (2) enables scientists and managers to easily access, manipulate and&nbsp;download data relevant to modeling climate change impacts on ecosystems through a common&nbsp;web-based data portal; and (3) explores ways to reduce redundant efforts to obtain and produce&nbsp;downscaled climate projections by soliciting feedback from the NCCWSC research community.&nbsp;Most importantly, this work enables&nbsp;impact assessments to be based on the same&nbsp;common data set, allowing researchers and resource managers to compare results and projections&nbsp;across regions and ecosystems. This work is a collaborative effort between scientists and&nbsp;researchers at the USGS, the USGS Cooperative Research Units Program, North Carolina State&nbsp;University, and Texas Tech University.<\/p>","parentId":"5050cc14e4b0be20bb30eac8","contacts":[{"name":"Jaime Collazo","oldPartyId":15981,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"Jaime_Collazo@ncsu.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Jaime","lastName":"Collazo","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"Jaime Collazo\/NCSU.EDU -

Our objectives were to determine whether (1) diet overlap and predation occurred between adult Walleyes and Largemouth Bass in four northern Wisconsin lakes and (2) the use of DNA barcoding to reduce unidentifiable fish in diet samples affected conclusions regarding diet overlap. A single occurrence of Walleye predation was observed in the diets of 945 Largemouth Bass. Moderate to high diet overlap was observed between Largemouth Bass and Walleyes throughout much of the study period. The use of DNA barcoding reduced the amount of unidentified fish in diets to &lt;1% and showed that failure to identify fish or fish parts can affect conclusions regarding diet overlap. Largemouth Bass predation is probably not a primary factor affecting Walleye abundance in the lakes we selected, but observed diet overlap suggests the potential for competition between the two species.","parentId":"573f4e0fe4b04a3a6a24ae75","contacts":[{"name":"Craig J.

Here, we document the spread of genetic introgression between a native ( \n<em>Oncorhynchus clarkii<\/em>) and invasive ( \n<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss<\/em>) trout, and identify the mechanisms influencing genetic admixture. In two populations inhabiting contrasting environments, non-native admixture increased rapidly from 1984 to 2007 and was driven by surprisingly consistent processes. Individual admixture was related to two phenotypic traits associated with fitness: size at spawning and age of juvenile emigration. Fish with higher non-native admixture were larger and tended to emigrate at a younger age\u2015relationships that are expected to confer fitness advantages to hybrid individuals. However, strong selection against non-native admixture was evident across streams and cohorts (mean selection coefficient against genotypes with non-native alleles ( \n<em>s<\/em>) = 0.60; s.e. = 0.10). Nevertheless, hybridization was promoted in both streams by the continuous immigration of individuals with high levels of non-native admixture from other hybrid source populations. Thus, antagonistic relationships between dispersal and selection are mediating invasive hybridization between these fish, emphasizing that data on dispersal and natural selection are needed to fully understand the dynamics of introgression between native and non-native species.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> \n<strong>This publication was developed as a part of the project,&nbsp; <a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/display-project\/5050cb9ce4b0be20bb30eac5\/4f8314c1e4b0e84f60868098\">The Potential Influence of Changing Climate on the Persistence of at Risk Native Salmonids<\/a>.<\/strong>","parentId":"506dd262e4b002b5ec71a9a3","contacts":[{"name":"Ryan P.

wetlands: fire, sea-level rise, and water levels","body":"Ecotones are areas of sharp environmental gradients between two or more homogeneous vegetation types. They are a dynamic aspect of all landscapes and are also responsive to climate change. Shifts in the position of an ecotone across a landscape can be an indication of a changing environment. In the coastal Everglades of Florida, USA, a dominant ecotone type is that of mangrove forest and marsh. However, there is a variety of plants that can form the marsh component, including sawgrass (Cladium mariscus [L.] Pohl), needlegrass rush (Juncus roemerianus Scheele), and spikerush (Eleocharis spp.). Environmental factors including water depth, soil type, and occurrence of fires vary across these ecotones, influencing their dynamics. Altered freshwater inflows from upstream and increasing sea level over the past 100 years may have also had an impact. We analyzed a time series of historical aerial photographs for a number of sites in the coastal Everglades and measured change in position of mangrove\u2013marsh ecotones. For three sites, detailed maps were produced and the area of marsh, mangrove, and other habitats was determined for five periods spanning the years 1928 to 2004. Contrary to our initial hypothesis on fire, we found that fire did not prevent mangrove expansion into marsh areas but may in fact assist mangroves to invade some marsh habitats, especially sawgrass. Disparate patterns in mangrove\u2013marsh change were measured at two downstream sites, both of which had multiple fires over from 1948 to 2004. No change in mangrove or marsh area was measured at one site. Mangrove area increased and marsh area decreased at the second of these fire-impacted sites. We measured a significant increase in mangrove area and a decline in marsh area at an upstream site that had little occurrence of fire. At this site, water levels have increased significantly as sea level has risen, and this has probably been a factor in the mangrove expansion.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["507466bce4b090654e7b278d"],"contacts":[{"name":"Thomas J.

Seabirds typically nest colonially and show strong site fidelity; therefore, conservation strategies could benefit from an understanding of the population dynamics and vulnerability of breeding colonies to climate change. More than 350 atolls exist across the Pacific Ocean; while they provide nesting habitat for many seabirds, they are also vulnerable to sea-level rise. We used French Frigate Shoals, the largest atoll in the Hawaiian Archipelago, as a case study to explore seabird colony dynamics and the potential consequences of sea-level rise. We compiled a unique combination of data sets: historical observations of islands and seabirds, a 30-year time series of population abundance, LiDAR- (light detection and ranging) derived elevations, and satellite imagery. To model population dynamics for ten species at Tern Island from 1980 to 2009, we used the Gompertz model with parameters for the population growth rate, density dependence, process variation, and observation error. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters. All species increased in a pattern that provided evidence of density dependence. Density dependence may exacerbate the consequences of sea-level rise on seabirds because species that are already near the carrying capacity of the nesting habitat will be limited more than species that still have space for population growth. Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis), Great Frigatebird (Fregata minor), Red-tailed Tropicbird (Phaethon rubricauda), Masked Booby (Sula dactylatra), Gray-backed Tern (Onychoprion lunatus), and White Tern (Gygis alba) are likely already at carrying capacity at Tern Island and therefore are most likely to be negatively impacted by sea-level rise. We project 12% of French Frigate Shoals (excluding La Perouse Pinnacle) will be inundated with +1.0 m sea-level rise or 32% with +2.0 m. Graybacked Terns that nest along the coastal perimeters of islands and shrub-nesting species that are habitat limited are especially vulnerable to sea-level rise. However, at Tern Island, seawalls and habitat creation may mitigate projected seabird population declines due to habitat loss. We predict substantial losses in seabird nesting habitat across the low-lying Hawaiian Islands by 2100 and emphasize the need to restore higher elevation seabird colonies.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;","parentId":"5074818fe4b090654e7b292e","contacts":[{"name":"Michelle H Reynolds","oldPartyId":8560,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"mreynolds@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Wildlife Biologist","firstName":"Michelle","middleName":"H","lastName":"Reynolds","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8089678568","officePhone":"8089856416","streetAddress":{"zip":"96718","country":"US","city":"Hawaii National Park","state":"HI","line1":"P.O Box 44\r\nCrater Rim drive\r\nBld 344"},"buildingCode":"WHF","name":"Michelle H Reynolds\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"96718","country":"USA","city":"Hawaii National Park","state":"HI","line1":"P.O.

To better understand present temperature regimes, we assembled a 29-year nearshore time series of mean monthly SSTs along the North Pacific coastline using remotely-sensed satellite data collected with the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument. We then used the dataset to describe nearshore (&lt;20 km offshore) SST patterns of 16 North Pacific ecoregions delineated by the Marine Ecoregions of the World (MEOW) hierarchical schema. Annual mean temperature varied from 3.8\u00b0C along the Kamchatka ecoregion to 24.8\u00b0C in the Cortezian ecoregion. There are smaller annual ranges and less variability in SST in the Northeast Pacific relative to the Northwest Pacific. Within the 16 ecoregions, 31\u201394% of the variance in SST is explained by the annual cycle, with the annual cycle explaining the least variation in the Northern California ecoregion and the most variation in the Yellow Sea ecoregion. Clustering on mean monthly SSTs of each ecoregion showed a clear break between the ecoregions within the Warm and Cold Temperate provinces of the MEOW schema, though several of the ecoregions contained within the provinces did not show a significant difference in mean seasonal temperature patterns. Comparison of these temperature patterns shared some similarities and differences with previous biogeographic classifications and the Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs).

We examined effects of climate and growing-season phenology on recruitment (8\u20139 months old) of young Shiras moose ( \n<em>Alces alces shirasi<\/em>) over three decades, from 18 herds, across a large geographic area encompassing much of the southern extent of their range. Recruitment declined in 8 of 18 herds during 1980\u20132009, whereas others did not exhibit a temporal trend (none showed a positive trend). During those three decades, seasonal temperatures increased, spring\u2013summer precipitation decreased, and spring occurred earlier, became shorter in duration, and green-up occurred faster. Recruitment was influenced negatively by warm temperatures during the year before young were born, but only for herds with declining recruitment. Dry spring\u2013summers of the previous year and rapid rates of spring green-up in the year of birth had similar negative influences across declining and stable herds. Those patterns indicate both direct (year&nbsp; \n<em>t<\/em>&nbsp;) and delayed (year&nbsp; \n<em>t\u2212<\/em>1) effects of weather and plant phenology on recruitment of young, which we hypothesize was mediated through effects on maternal nutritional condition. Suppressed nutrition could have been induced by (1) increased thermoregulatory costs associated with warming temperatures and (2) shortened duration of availability of high-quality forage in spring. Progressive reductions in net energetic gain for species that are sensitive to climate may continue to hamper individual fitness and population dynamics.","parentId":"507465dee4b090654e7b2782","contacts":[{"name":"Kevin L.

Unraveling the relationships between climate and population dynamics, and projecting them across time, advances ecological understanding that informs and steers sustainable conservation for species. Using pronghorn ( \n<em>Antilocapra americana<\/em>) as an ecological model, we used a Bayesian approach to analyze long-term population, precipitation, and temperature data from 18 populations in the southwestern United States. We determined which long-term (12 and 24 months) or short-term (gestation trimester and lactation period) climatic conditions best predicted annual rate of population growth (\u03bb). We used these predictions to project population trends through 2090. Projections incorporated downscaled climatic data matched to pronghorn range for each population, given a high and a lower atmospheric CO \n<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;concentration scenario. Since the 1990s, 15 of the pronghorn populations declined in abundance. Sixteen populations demonstrated a significant relationship between precipitation and \u03bb, and in 13 of these, temperature was also significant. Precipitation predictors of \u03bb were highly seasonal, with lactation being the most important period, followed by early and late gestation. The influence of temperature on \u03bb was less seasonal than precipitation, and lacked a clear temporal pattern. The climatic projections indicated that all of these pronghorn populations would experience increased temperatures, while the direction and magnitude of precipitation had high population-specific variation. Models predicted that nine populations would be extirpated or approaching extirpation by 2090. Results were consistent across both atmospheric CO \n<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;concentration scenarios, indicating robustness of trends irrespective of climatic severity. In the southwestern United States, the climate underpinning pronghorn populations is shifting, making conditions increasingly inhospitable to pronghorn persistence. This realization informs and steers conservation and management decisions for pronghorn in North America, while exemplifying how similar research can aid ungulates inhabiting arid regions and confronting similar circumstances elsewhere.","parentId":"527421cfe4b097f32ac3f3e8","contacts":[{"name":"Jay V.

Some populations are declining, which may be linked to the long-term trend in warmer, drier conditions and reduced monsoonal rainfall across their range. It\u2019s believed that temperature and humidity levels have been too high, reducing the survival of eggs and chicks. Climate models project decreasing rainfall and warming temperatures to continue for the region, so understanding this linkage is becoming increasingly critical.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nTo address this need, researchers will measure the success of scaled quail nests at locations across their range, to determine if nest success is related to temperature, humidity, and precipitation. The results of this study will provide managers with information on the degree to which changes in each of these climatic variables threatens the scaled quail, and will help identify management actions that may need to be taken to protect the species into the future.&nbsp; <\/div>","purpose":"Across the southwestern U.S., long-term declines in populations of scaled quail and contraction of their range-wide distribution have caught the attention of avian ecologists (Cantu et al. 2006). One of the factors hypothesized as a primary cause of this decline is a long-term trend in warmer, drier conditions and reduced monsoonal rainfall across their range. The mechanism believed to be driving this trend is declining nest success due to temperature and humidity levels above a critical threshold for egg and chick survival. While habitat loss cannot be discounted as a possible driver, areas managed specifically for scaled quail in western Texas have seen similar losses in population numbers across the same time frame indicating that these reductions are independent of habitat related factors (Rollins 2000). Coupled with climate models forecasting shifts in the arrival of summer monsoon rains away from the critical reproductive periods of June and July (Cook and Seager 2013), the long-term forecast for scaled quail response to decreased rainfall and higher temperatures is bleak. Scaled quail are considered to be a key indicator species of the health of the habits they occupy across the southwest and are frequently used to assess the success of restoration projects undertaken by federal and state agencies (Coffman 2012). Researchers will use this species to study climate effects (temperature, humidity, and precipitation) preceding, during and following the nesting season with a primary focus on how these climate variables affect nest success. The primary objective will be to measure nest success in different populations across their range and determine if nest success is related to temperature and humidity measurements taken in incubating nests using ibuttons. This project could be expanded in future years if funding becomes available to compare presence\/absence of scaled quail on White Sands Missile Range (where habitat condition is driven by only climate variables because grazing has not occurred in over 50 years) using drought indices to determine if measures of precipitation, temperature and humidity can predict scaled quail abundance.","parentId":"51a4bf80e4b064a995b7a0dd","contacts":[{"name":"Scott A Carleton","oldPartyId":58241,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"scarleton@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Assistant Unit Leader","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Scott","middleName":"A","lastName":"Carleton","organization":{"displayText":"New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"5756461281","officePhone":"5756467196","streetAddress":{"zip":"99003","city":"Las Cruces","state":"NM","line1":"2980 Espina St, NM State Univ Knox Hall"},"buildingCode":"KGL","name":"Scott A Carleton\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"88003","country":"USA","city":"Las Cruces","state":"NM","line1":"P.O.

Here we present the first quantitative description of iron removal in a meltwater-dominated estuary. We find that 85% of \u201cdissolved\u201d Fe is removed in the low-salinity region of the estuary along with 41% of \u201ctotal dissolvable\u201d iron associated with glacial flour. We couple these findings with hydrologic and geochemical data from Gulf of Alaska (GoA) glacierized catchments to calculate meltwater-derived fluxes of size and species partitioned Fe to the GoA. Iron flux data indicate that labile iron in the glacial flour and associated Fe minerals dominate the meltwater contribution to the Fe budget of the GoA. As such, GoA nutrient cycles and related ecosystems could be strongly influenced by continued ice loss in its watershed.","parentId":"50747f52e4b090654e7b28a3","contacts":[{"name":"Schroth, Andrew W.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Crusius, John","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Hoyer, Ian","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Campbell, Robert","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/2014GL060199\/abstract","title":"Schroth et al. 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"biogeochemical cycles"},{"name":"biogeochemical processes"},{"name":"biogeochemical modeling"},{"name":"Biogeochemistry"},{"name":"Geochemical cycles"},{"name":"Trace element cycling"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-06-06","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-08-15T08:00:42.948-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-08-08T15:37:23.197-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Geophysical Research Letters","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1002\/2014GL060199"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"startPage","value":"3951"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issn","value":"1944-8007"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issue","value":"11"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"endPage","value":"3958"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"volume","value":"41"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","people":["Schroth, Andrew W.","Crusius, John","Hoyer, Ian","Campbell, Robert"]},"5463c5b0e4b0ba83040c73da":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"5463c5b0e4b0ba83040c73da","title":"Evaluating Adaptations of Desert Bighorn Sheep to Climate Change in the Southwestern U.S.","body":"<div>In the southwestern U.S., climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme droughts and cause an overall decrease in precipitation and increase in temperatures. These changes could impact a wide range of species in the region, even those adapted to living in arid environments. It\u2019s possible that some species may be able to adapt to changing conditions by migrating to new locations or altering their behavior, while others may have genetic traits that activate physiological changes to cope with heat and water stress.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThis project will focus on desert bighorn sheep and explore potential adaptations that may help them persist despite varying climates throughout their range. Previous research has shown that some sheep populations may already be declining due to the impacts of reduced rainfall on water availability and vegetation quality and quantity. This project seeks to determine whether some populations carry genetic traits that enable them to tolerate hotter and drier conditions. Researchers will compare DNA samples from desert bighorn sheep in three different desert ecosystems in the Southwest. Each of these ecosystems has a slightly different local climate, and it\u2019s possible that bighorn sheep in the hotter and drier ecosystems have evolved mechanisms to better cope with the particularly harsh conditions.<br>\n<br>\nThis comparison will inform our understanding of whether desert bighorn sheep may be vulnerable, given projected changes in temperature and precipitation. Further, the results can help wildlife managers determine which actions may allow for desert bighorn sheep to persist as the climate continues to change.&nbsp;<\/div>\n","purpose":"The predicted increased occurrence of extreme droughts, overall decline in precipitation and increase in temperature due to climate change has the potential to impact a large number of species in the southwestern United States. Determining genome differentiation of desert bighorn sheep between populations in the 3 southwestern desert ecosystems has the potential to inform vulnerability of the species to climate change where the areas currently occupied by desert bighorn sheep are becoming increasingly hotter and more arid.  Specifically, developing an understanding of certain genes that may be related to the ecology of the different desert environments can provide valuable insights regarding future adaptation actions (e.g., translocations) as the climate continues to change. The objectives for this project are to (1) assess whether desert bighorn sheep exhibit local adaptations to the different desert ecosystems with their corresponding differences in seasonal climatic conditions; and (2) provide recommendations on how managers can implement adaptation actions to maximize evolutionary potential.","parentId":"53beaa25e4b0527d5d411803","contacts":[{"name":"James W Cain","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jwcain@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Assistant Unit Leader, Research Wildlife Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"James","middleName":"W","lastName":"Cain","organization":{"displayText":"New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"5756461281","officePhone":"5756463382","streetAddress":{"zip":"99003","city":"Las Cruces","state":"NM","line1":"2980 Espina St, NM State Univ Knox Hall, Knox Hall"},"buildingCode":"KGL","name":"James W Cain\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"88003","country":"USA","city":"Las Cruces","state":"NM","line1":"P.O.

This information will be used to predict how inland fisheries production might change under different future scenarios of climate and land use change.<\/div>\n","parentId":"5703c926e4b0328dcb822b49","contacts":[{"name":"David Bunnell","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"dbunnell@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Great Lakes Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"7342149324","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"48105","country":"USA","city":"Ann Arbor","state":"MI","line1":"1451 Green Road"}}},{"name":"NCCWSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"inland fisheries"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"climate change"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"land use"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"time series"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"global impact"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"freshwater fisheries"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"NCCWSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2016"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2016-03-23","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2017-09-30","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-05-18T08:16:36.376-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-25T11:54:59.329-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Technical Summary","value":"We propose that analyzing time series of fisheries harvests and ecosystem changes can better show effects of climate change and land use on inland fisheries than an approach that analyzes data from hundreds of lakes in a given year. Tracking large-scale landscape changes (e.g., land use) as well as annual changes (e.g., water levels that can drive recruitment and fishing access) on a lake-by-lake basis can help inform how long-term trends may influence fisheries. Our main objectives in this study are to (1) understand the relative importance among climate change and land use variables to fisheries production in inland lakes with different levels of depth and food and water security, and (2) predict changes in fisheries production in inland lakes under scenarios of predicted land use and climate changes.

We evaluate GENMOM by comparison with reanalysis products (e.g., NCEP2) and three models used in the IPCC AR4 assessment. GENMOM produces a global temperature bias of 0.6 &deg;C. Atmospheric features such as the jet stream structure and major semi-permanent sea level pressure centers are well simulated as is the mean planetary-scale wind structure that is needed to produce the correct position of stormtracks. Most ocean surface currents are reproduced except where they are not resolvable at T31 resolution. Overall, GENMOM captures reasonably well the observed gradients and spatial distributions of annual surface temperature and precipitation and the simulations are on par with other AOGCMs. Deficiencies in the GENMOM simulations include a warm bias in the surface temperature over the southern oceans, a split in the ITCZ and weaker-than-observed overturning circulation.","parentId":"50a65318e4b0d446a665caa4","contacts":[{"name":"J.

To help address research questions across these scales, we provide here a standardized framework for a biogeographical information system containing queriable biological data that allows extraction of information on multiple species, across a variety of spatial scales based on species distributions, natural history attributes and habitat requirements. As scientists shift from research on localized impacts on individual species to regional and global scale threats, macroecological approaches of studying multiple species over broad geographical areas are becoming increasingly important. The standardized framework described here for capturing and integrating biological and geographical data is a critical first step towards addressing these macroecological questions and we urge organizations capturing biogeoinformatics data to consider adopting this framework.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50748153e4b090654e7b291e"],"contacts":[{"name":"Deborah A.

Projected sea-level rise of 0.3-1.5 meters&nbsp;poses further threat to several endemic tidal marsh species that&nbsp;are listed as federally endangered or state threatened species,&nbsp;such as the salt marsh harvest mouse, the California clapper rail,and the California black rail. Resource and land managers charged with the protection of endangered species and their habitats are in need of site-specific predictions of anticipated climate change impacts through the synthesis of downscaled regional climate change models and available data on species\u2019 ecological constraints. Changing sediment loads, extreme tide and storm events, salinities, and sea level rise will affect tidal marshes by altering the plant community composition and structure that provide the critical habitat for these endemic species. Our interdisciplinary study objectives were to: (1) develop high resolution elevation models of San Francisco Bay tidal salt marshes and predict effects of sea level rise; (2) determine and quantify the likely effect of sea level rise on vertebrate endemic species and their salt marsh habitats at local and regional landscape levels; (3) evaluate whether remnant marshes accrete at rates that will be sustainable through time or whether some will be \u201cdrowned\u201d; and (4) downscale tidal cycles to assess site-specific inundation patterns in estuary tidal marshes.<\/p>","parentId":"5050cb9ce4b0be20bb30eac5","linkParentIds":["56017c93e4b03bc34f5444ee"],"contacts":[{"name":"John Y Takekawa","oldPartyId":10196,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"john_takekawa@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Scientist Emeritus","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"John","middleName":"Y","lastName":"Takekawa","organization":{"displayText":"San Francisco Bay Estuary Field Station, WERC"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"7075622000","streetAddress":{"zip":"94592","city":"Vallejo","state":"CA","line1":"505 Azuar Drive"},"buildingCode":"WBW","name":"John Y Takekawa\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

Current sea-level rise projections range widely with 0.57 to 1.9 meters increase in mea sea level by 2100. The expected accelerated rate of sea-level rise through the 21<sup>st<\/sup> century will put many coastal ecosystems at risk, especially those in topographically low-gradient areas.\n\nWe assessed marsh accretion and plant community state changes through 2100 at 12 tidal salt marshes around San Francisco Bay estuary with a sea-level rise response model. Detailed ground elevation, vegetation, and water level data were collected at all sites between 2008 and 2011 and used as model inputs. Sediment cores (taken by Callaway and others, 2012) at four sites around San Francisco Bay estuary were used to estimate accretion rates. A modification of the Callaway and others (1996) model, the Wetland Accretion Rate Model for Ecosystem Resilience (WARMER), was utilized to run sea-level rise response models for all sites. With a mean sea level rise of 1.24 m by 2100, WARMER projected that the vast majority, 95.8 percent (1,942 hectares), of marsh area in our study will lose marsh plant communities by 2100 and to transition to a relative elevation range consistent with mudflat habitat. Three marshes were projected to maintain marsh vegetation to 2100, but they only composed 4.2 percent (85 hectares) of the total marsh area surveyed.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50782a12e4b0df5513bf60f9"],"contacts":[{"name":"John Y.

To provide a proof of concept of the value of scenario planning in helping managers prepare for climate change, we conducted a pilot scenario planning effort aimed at helping state agencies in the northeastern United States develop climate-informed moose management goals and actions.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nTo encourage participation by wildlife managers, we provided several opportunities for them to learn about scenario planning and examples of its application in natural resource management. We shared this information via guidance documents on incorporating climate change into State Wildlife Action Plans, organized sessions at professional conferences, on-line presentations, periodic project newsletters, and small group meetings with state wildlife managers. These educational efforts reached well over 50 managers across the northeast and other parts of the country, and were successful in building interest in scenario planning. In September 2016, we partnered with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NY-DEC) to lead a 1-day scenario planning exercise focused on setting goals and objectives for a state-wide moose management plan. WCS then worked closely with scientists at the Northeast Climate Science Center to develop a set of future climate scenarios that are directly relevant to examining how the draft moose populations goals and objectives developed during the first workshop might hold up under different scenarios of climate change. These scenarios will be used by NY-DEC in Spring 2017 when they take their next steps to prepare a moose management plan for the state.<br>\n&nbsp;","parentId":"5463d66ce4b0ba83040c7715","contacts":[{"name":"Molly Cross","oldPartyId":64729,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"mcross@wcs.org","active":true,"firstName":"Molly","lastName":"Cross","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseTypes":["Report"],"tags":[{"name":"moose"},{"name":"WCS"},{"name":"moose management plan"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2016-12","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-12-20T09:40:41.013-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2017-01-12T11:03:16.107-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":202148,"useForPreview":false,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"6191951bb5f79489553fceb05a4133e7"},"dateUploaded":"2016-12-20T23:38:38.000Z","name":"WCS_ScenarioPlanning_FINAL_Report.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__2a\/62\/31\/2a623171442670e78459fd65431f46a951df52aa","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/58595f09e4b03639a6025f79?f=__disk__2a%2F62%2F31%2F2a623171442670e78459fd65431f46a951df52aa"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/58595f09e4b03639a6025f79","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalReport_Sce.zip","files":""}],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","people":["Molly Cross"]},"55956460e4b03ae2f4dbe124":{"relationships":{"total":4,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/4f833e05e4b0e84f608680d8","rel":"alternate of","relatedRel":"alternate","title":"Fire modulates climate change response of simulated aspen distribution across topoclimatic gradients in a semi-arid montane landscape","relatedTitle":"Quantifying Vulnerability of Quaking Aspen Woodlands and Associated Bird Communities to Global Climate Change in the Northern Great Basin","id":"55956460e4b03ae2f4dbe124","relatedId":"4f833e05e4b0e84f608680d8","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/4f833e05e4b0e84f608680d8","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Fire modulates climate change response of simulated aspen distribution across topoclimatic gradients in a semi-arid montane landscape","relatedTitle":"Quantifying Vulnerability of Quaking Aspen Woodlands and Associated Bird Communities to Global Climate Change in the Northern Great Basin","id":"55956460e4b03ae2f4dbe124","relatedId":"4f833e05e4b0e84f608680d8","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/55956460e4b03ae2f4dbe124","rel":"alternate","relatedRel":"alternate of","title":"Quantifying Vulnerability of Quaking Aspen Woodlands and Associated Bird Communities to Global Climate Change in the Northern Great Basin","relatedTitle":"Fire modulates climate change response of simulated aspen distribution across topoclimatic gradients in a semi-arid montane landscape","id":"4f833e05e4b0e84f608680d8","relatedId":"55956460e4b03ae2f4dbe124","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/55956460e4b03ae2f4dbe124","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Quantifying Vulnerability of Quaking Aspen Woodlands and Associated Bird Communities to Global Climate Change in the Northern Great Basin","relatedTitle":"Fire modulates climate change response of simulated aspen distribution across topoclimatic gradients in a semi-arid montane landscape","id":"4f833e05e4b0e84f608680d8","relatedId":"55956460e4b03ae2f4dbe124","annotation":null}]},"id":"55956460e4b03ae2f4dbe124","title":"Fire modulates climate change response of simulated aspen distribution across topoclimatic gradients in a semi-arid montane landscape","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10980-015-0160-1):&nbsp; \n<h3>Content<\/h3> \n<p>Changing aspen distribution in response to climate change and fire is a major focus of biodiversity conservation, yet little is known about the potential response of aspen to these two driving forces along topoclimatic gradients.<\/p> \n<h3>Objective<\/h3> \n<p>This study is set to evaluate how aspen distribution might shift in response to different climate-fire scenarios in a semi-arid montane landscape, and quantify the influence of fire regime along topoclimatic gradients.<\/p> \n<h3>Methods<\/h3> \n<p>We used a novel integration of a forest landscape succession and disturbance model (LANDIS-II) with a fine-scale climatic water deficit approach to simulate dynamics of aspen and associated conifer and shrub species over the next 150&nbsp;years under various climate-fire scenarios.<\/p> \n<h3>Results<\/h3> \n<p>Simulations suggest that many aspen stands could persist without fire for centuries under current climate conditions. However, a simulated 2\u20135&nbsp;&deg;C increase in temperature caused a substantial reduction of aspen coverage at lower elevations and a modest increase at upper elevations, leading to an overall reduction of aspen range at the landscape level.

Scientists from the US&nbsp;Geological Survey (USGS)&nbsp;worked closely with state management agencies and the National&nbsp;Wildlife Federation to complete several objectives that provide knowledge to aid their planning and&nbsp;management strategies in anticipation of coming changes. First, researchers updated a regional Great Lakes&nbsp;climate model to predict water level changes, water temperatures, and ice cover data for the entire Great Lakes&nbsp;basin 50-100 years into the future. Second, researchers used satellite data to determine whether the recent&nbsp;climate warming has influenced the timing and magnitude of algal production in lakes Michigan and Huron.&nbsp;Third, they used long-term data sets and time series models to explore how climate influences variability in&nbsp;fish production in lakes Michigan and Huron. These models were&nbsp;then used along with future climate&nbsp;predictions to forecast future fish production over the next 50-100 years in these lakes. Finally, researchers used bioenergetics modeling to explore how warmer water temperatures will influence the growth and&nbsp;consumption rates of several managed Great Lakes fish species.<\/p>","purpose":"This file can be used to join basin wide data to individual lakes and\/or display different symbology for individual lake","parentId":"5050cc14e4b0be20bb30eac8","contacts":[{"name":"David Bunnell","oldPartyId":1349,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"dbunnell@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Fishery Biologist","firstName":"David","lastName":"Bunnell","organization":{"displayText":"Great Lakes Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"7349948780","officePhone":"7342149324","streetAddress":{"zip":"48105","city":"Ann Arbor","state":"MI","line1":"1451 Green Rd"},"buildingCode":"BDA","name":"David Bunnell\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"48105","country":"USA","city":"Ann Arbor","state":"MI","line1":"1451 Green Road"},"building":"GLSC - AA - R and D Bldg"}},{"name":"Brent M.

Although scientists have made tremendous progress in predicting the impact&nbsp;of climate change on a regional and global scale, drilling down such projections to a locally applicable&nbsp;form has been difficult. A major project of the US&nbsp;Geological Survey's (USGS) Southwest Biological Science Center (SBSC),&nbsp;funded by the USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC), drew on the work of an&nbsp;interdisciplinary team of scientists to help close the gap between theory and practical application in the&nbsp;arid southwestern U.S.&nbsp;Climate change in this region is&nbsp;predicted to be extreme, with temperature increases within the next 60 to 90 years of 3.5 to 4 degrees&nbsp;Celsius and decreases in precipitation of 5 to 20 percent. These changes have the potential to profoundly&nbsp;affect plant and animal distributions and population viability. Furthermore, more than 70 percent of the&nbsp;lands in the southwestern U.S. are in public ownership. Managers of public lands and wildlife resources&nbsp;will have a particular need to understand climate-driven shifts in order to adapt management strategies to&nbsp;conserve and sustain habitats and wildlife. This project integrated results from three modules to produce data and tools that conservation managers can use in decision-making. These three modules enable scientists to assess the future prospects of the habitats and species most vulnerable to climate change in the Southwest. This information is vital to managers tasked with prioritizing conservation efforts and adapting strategies to sustain habitats and wildlife.

The modeled projections were then used to evaluate climate change effects on high priority bird species, waterfowl, amphibians, and fisheries. In particular, the researchers sought to answer two key questions: (1) what are the impacts of predicted climate change on ecosystem structure, processes, and services, particularly those affecting DOI trust resources and species, in the LMV? and (2) will current restoration, mitigation, and adaptation strategies meet desired conservation targets and outcomes under projected future climates?.

The goal of this study was to compare passive \"bathtub\" inundation models based on geographic information systems (GIS) to those that include dynamic water levels caused by wave-induced set-up and run-up for two end-member island morphologies: Midway, a classic atoll with islands on the shallow (2-8 m) atoll rim and a deep, central lagoon; and Laysan, which is characterized by a deep (20-30 m) atoll rim and an island at the center of the atoll. Vulnerability to elevated water levels was assessed using hindcast wind and wave data to drive coupled physics-based numerical wave, current, and water-level models for the atolls. The resulting model data were then used to compute run-up elevations using a parametric run-up equation under both present conditions and future sea-level-rise scenarios. In both geomorphologies, wave heights and wavelengths adjacent to the island shorelines increased more than three times and four times, respectively, with increasing values of sea-level rise, as more deep-water wave energy could propagate over the atoll rim and larger wind-driven waves could develop on the atoll. Although these increases in water depth resulted in decreased set-up along the islands\u2019 shorelines, the larger wave heights and longer wavelengths due to sea-level rise increased the resulting wave-induced run-up. Run-up values were spatially heterogeneous and dependent on the direction of incident wave direction, bathymetry, and island configuration. Island inundation was modeled to increase substantially when wave-driven effects were included, suggesting that inundation and impacts to infrastructure and terrestrial habitats will occur at lower values of predicted sea-level rise, and thus sooner in the 21st century, than suggested by passive GIS-based \"bathtub\" inundation models. Lastly, observations and the modeling results suggest that classic atolls with islands on a shallow atoll rim are more susceptible to the combined effects of sea-level rise and wave-driven inundation than atolls characterized by a deep atoll rim.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5074818fe4b090654e7b292e"],"contacts":[{"name":"Curt D.

However, the processes that transport iron to the ocean surface are poorly quantified. We combine satellite and meteorological data to provide the first description of widespread dust transport from coastal Alaska into the GoA. Dust is frequently transported from glacially-derived sediment at the mouths of several rivers, the most prominent of which is the Copper River. These dust events occur most frequently in autumn, when coastal river levels are low and riverbed sediments are exposed. The dust plumes are transported several hundred kilometers beyond the continental shelf into iron-limited waters. We estimate the mass of dust transported from the Copper River valley during one 2006 dust event to be between 25\u201380 ktons. Based on conservative estimates, this equates to a soluble iron loading of 30\u2013200 tons. We suggest the soluble Fe flux from dust originating in glaciofluvial sediment deposits from the entire GoA coastline is two to three times larger, and is comparable to the annual Fe flux to GoA surface waters from eddies of coastal origin. Given that glaciers are retreating in the coastal GoA region and in other locations, it is important to examine whether fluxes of dust are increasing from glacierized landscapes to the ocean, and to assess the impact of associated Fe on marine ecosystems.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50747f52e4b090654e7b28a3"],"contacts":[{"name":"J.

With this study, researchers are working to fill this knowledge gap by estimating the overall fishery production in river networks globally using multivariate statistical models with explanatory variables compiled from remotely sensed and in\u2010situ observations.\n<br> \n<br> The freshwater fish production in rivers is being estimated by:&nbsp;\n<br> 1. Developing models using key drivers (temperature, precipitation, land use variables etc.) that impact fish production and validating these models using existing harvest data from river fisheries.&nbsp;\n<br> 2. Predicting the response of river fish production to global change (climate and land use) using the present day river fish production model as a baseline and using downscaled climate scenarios. We are focusing on global inland river systems which will complement another project focusing on estimation of fishery production from the lakes (Bunnell et al. 2014, Deines et al. 2014).&nbsp;\n<br> \n<br> Fisheries data from global rivers are currently not collected in a standardized format. By developing a standardized database and then a transferable global production model we will be able to &nbsp;remotely estimate drivers of fish productivity and compare them with in\u2010situ data collected from regions with current field assessment programs. With the improved understanding of the river fishery production estimates, policy makers and managers also can have better information to formulate their annual harvesting policies to keep their fisheries stock within maximum sustainable limits.","purpose":"To identify novel ways to estimate river fish production on a global scale; develop data-limited production models for river fisheries using non-traditional approaches, project fish production estimates with climate change; and manage a global river fisheries database.","parentId":"55130bdbe4b02e76d75c074f","contacts":[{"name":"William W.

A comprehensive understanding of how climate change is and will impact inland fishes worldwide is key to sustainable management of this ecologically and economically important natural resource. Synthesis of projected and documented impacts of climate change on inland fishes globally can be useful to inform future research and management efforts. Since the mid-1980s, scientists have projected the effects of climate change on inland fish, and in more recent years, documentation of climate change impacts on fish has increased, albeit the number of documented impacts of climate change on inland fish remains low. We conducted an extensive, systematic literature review to identify both projected and documented examples of climate change impacts on fish globally. We did not include studies that analyzed climate variability; thus, all documented examples showed a change in precipitation, temperature, or other climate variable that was be attributed to climate change by the authors. We then categorized the documented studies into 6 groups based on the type of response variable studied (i.e., demographic, phenological, distributional, etc.) and extracted the data to quantitatively analyze trends across species traits and thermal guilds. Dissecting and providing current global trends in fish responses to climate change by ecological and thermal guild will help managers anticipate future changes in fish populations and develop more strategic management plans for individual species and groups.<\/div>\n","parentId":"5703c926e4b0328dcb822b49","contacts":[{"name":"Bonnie J Myers","type":"Principal

Quantity of urban growth at county and place (i.e., city) scales is simulated using population, urban density and nearest neighbor dependent attributes. We compared three meso-scale LTMs to three null models that lack meso-scale drivers. Models were developed using circa 1990\u20132000 data and validated using change in the 2001 and 2006 National Land Cover Databases (NLCD). LTM and null models were assessed using the mean difference in quantity between simulated and actual growth measured at multiple spatial scales. We found that LTM models performed relatively well at spatial scales as small as 450 m, and that the mean difference between the NLCD and LTM with meso-scale drivers at 900&nbsp;m was 2\u20133%, whereas null models produced a mean difference of&nbsp;\n<img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/na101\/home\/literatum\/publisher\/tandf\/journals\/entities\/223C.gif\" \/>5%.

For effects on fish populations of riverine ecosystems, climate output simulated by coarse-resolution AOGCMs and RCMs must be downscaled to basins to river hydrology to population response. One needs to transfer the information from these climate simulations down to the individual scale in a way that minimizes extrapolation and can account for spatio-temporal variability in the intervening stages. The goal is a framework to determine whether, given uncertainties in the climate models and the biological response, meaningful inference can still be made. The non-linear downscaling of climate information to the river scale requires that one realistically account for spatial and temporal variability across scale. Our downscaling procedure includes the use of fixed\/calibrated hydrological flow and temperature models coupled with a stochastically parameterized sturgeon bioenergetics model. We show that, although there is a large amount of uncertainty associated with both the climate model output and the fish growth process, one can establish significant differences in fish growth distributions between models, and between future and current climates for a given model.","parentId":"507467d9e4b090654e7b27c5","contacts":[{"name":"Mark L Wildhaber","oldPartyId":11236,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"mwildhaber@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Mark","middleName":"L","lastName":"Wildhaber","organization":{"displayText":"Columbia Environmental Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"5738761896","officePhone":"5738761847","streetAddress":{"zip":"65201","city":"Columbia","state":"MO","line1":"4200 New Haven Road"},"buildingCode":"KCK","name":"Mark L Wildhaber\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"65201","country":"USA","city":"Columbia","state":"MO","line1":"4200 New Haven Road"},"building":"CERC - Tech Center"}},{"name":"Christopher K.

We studied individual and population-level fitness costs of a climate change-induced stressor: camouflage mismatch in seasonally colour molting species confronting decreasing snow cover duration. Based on field measurements of radiocollared snowshoe hares, we found strong selection on coat colour molt phenology, such that animals mismatched with the colour of their background experienced weekly survival decreases up to 7%. In the absence of adaptive response, we show that these mortality costs would result in strong population-level declines by the end of the century. However, natural selection acting on wide individual variation in molt phenology might enable evolutionary adaptation to camouflage mismatch. We conclude that evolutionary rescue will be critical for hares and other colour molting species to keep up with climate change.","parentId":"50744472e4b090654e7b24e1","contacts":[{"name":"Marketa Zimova","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"L.

However, most existing methods for evaluating the accuracy of presence\u2013absence (binary) predictions of species require presence\u2013absence data. The aim of this study is to present a new method for accuracy assessment that does not rely on absence data.<\/span> \n<div>\n  &nbsp;\n<\/div> \n<div>\n  Two new statistics Fpb and Fcpb were derived based on presence\u2013background data. With generated six virtual species, we used DOMAIN, generalized linear modeling (GLM), and maximum entropy (MAXENT) to produce different species presence\u2013absence predictions. To investigate the effectiveness of the new statistics in accuracy assessment, we used Fpb, Fcpb, the traditional F-measure (F), kappa coefficient, true skill statistic (TSS), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the contrast validation index (CVI) to evaluate the accuracy of predictions, and the behaviors of these accuracy measures were compared. The effectiveness of Fpb for threshold selection and estimation of species prevalence was also investigated.\n<\/div> \n<div>\n  &nbsp;\n<\/div> \n<div>\n  Experimental results show that Fcpb is an estimate of F. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (COR) between Fcpb and F is 0.9882, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.0171. In general, Fpb, Fcpb, F, kappa coefficient, TSS, and CVI can sort models by the accuracy of binary prediction, but AUC is not appropriate to evaluate the accuracy of binary prediction. For DOMAIN, GLM, and MAXENT, finding the threshold by maximizing Fpb and by maximizing F result in similar accuracies. In addition, the estimation of species prevalence based on binary output with maximizing Fpb as the thresholding method is significantly more accurate than simply averaging the original continuous output. The best estimate of prevalence is provided by the binary output of MAXENT, with an RMSE of 0.0116.\n<\/div> \n<div>\n  &nbsp;\n<\/div> \n<div>\n  Finally, we conclude that the new method is promising in accuracy assessment, threshold selection, and estimation of species prevalence, all of which are important but challenging problems with presence-only data. Because it does not require absence data, the new method will have important applications in ecological niche modeling.\n<\/div>","parentId":"507467aae4b090654e7b27ba","webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1600-0587.2013.07585.x\/full","title":"Li and Guo, 2013","hidden":false}],"dates":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-07-17T10:56:45.720-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2013-07-17T10:57:46.584-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0"},"4f833af3e4b0e84f608680b6":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"4f833af3e4b0e84f608680b6","title":"How will Florida\u2019s Biodiversity Respond to Climate Change?","body":"<p>Florida is home to 50 endangered species, 23 National Wildlife Refuges, 9 national parks, and 119 state parks.

In this unique situation, there are many important questions about how Florida\u2019s biodiversity will respond to a changing climate, such as \"Which species and habitats will increase and which will decrease?\" and \"What role does human-induced land use-land cover (LULC) change play?\". Before these questions can be answered, accurate regional climate change scenarios must be developed. This project used down-scale predictions from a suite of coupled Atmospheric-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) to make regional scale predictions for the Florida peninsula. Climate outputs were then used as inputs to a suite of species\/habitat\/ecosystem models that are being used in the Greater Everglades and Suwannee River-Big Bend, as a proof of concept that down-scaled climate results can work in ecological forecast models. Scientists ran three scenarios of LULC: past (circa 1900), present, and future (2021-2050). Additional climate model runs addressed the contribution of greenhouse gasses to climate variability and change over the Florida peninsula. Model perturbation experiments were performed to address sources of variability and their contribution to the output regional climate change scenarios. The objective of this project was to develop scenarios that specifically address potential changes in temperature (land and near sea surface) and rainfall fields over the peninsula. The scenarios and modeling results were provided to state, federal, and NGO resource management groups via workshops in which the scenarios were used to predict responses of additional selected species, habitats, and ecosystems.","materialRequestInstructions":"<p>Atmospheric-Ocean General Circulation Models<\/p>","parentId":"5050cc14e4b0be20bb30eac8","contacts":[{"name":"Thomas J Smith","oldPartyId":9669,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"tom_j_smith@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Thomas","middleName":"J","lastName":"Smith","cellPhone":"7272048880","organization":{"displayText":"Southeast Ecological Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"7275028001","officePhone":"7275028130","streetAddress":{"zip":"33701","city":"St. Petersburg","state":"FL","line1":"600 4Th Street South"},"buildingCode":"AFP","name":"Thomas J Smith\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"33701","country":"USA","city":"St. Petersburg","state":"FL","line1":"600 4th Street South"},"building":"Studebaker Building"}},{"name":"Don DeAngelis","oldPartyId":2404,"type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"don_deangelis@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Don","lastName":"DeAngelis","organization":{"displayText":"Southeast Ecological Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"3052843039","officePhone":"3052841690","streetAddress":{"zip":"33124-0421","country":"US","city":"Coral Gables","state":"FL","line1":"Dept.

Puma ( \n<em>Puma concolor<\/em>) populations are expected to be influenced by inter-population movements and susceptible to human-induced source\u2013sink dynamics. Using long-term datasets we quantified the contribution of two puma populations to operationally define them as sources or sinks. The puma population in the Northern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (NGYE) was largely insulated from human-induced mortality by Yellowstone National Park. Pumas in the western Montana Garnet Mountain system were exposed to greater human-induced mortality, which changed over the study due to the closure of a 915&nbsp;km2&nbsp;area to hunting. The NGYE\u2019s population growth depended on inter-population movements, as did its ability to act as a source to the larger region. The heavily hunted Garnet area was a sink with a declining population until the hunting closure, after which it became a source with positive intrinsic growth and a 16&times; increase in emigration. We also examined the spatial and temporal characteristics of individual dispersal attributes (emigration, dispersal distance, establishment success) of subadult pumas ( \n<em>N<\/em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;126). Human-caused mortality was found to negatively impact all three dispersal components. Our results demonstrate the influence of human-induced mortality on not only within population vital rates, but also inter-population vital rates, affecting the magnitude and mechanisms of local population\u2019s contribution to the larger metapopulation. \n<div> \n <div>\n  &nbsp;\n <\/div> \n<\/div>","materialRequestInstructions":"For assistance accessing this publication, please contact the publication authors.","parentId":"50744472e4b090654e7b24e1","contacts":[{"name":"Jesse R.

The most widely recognized pathway suggests that climate change impacts habitat and fish populations (e.g., water temperature impacting fish survival) and cascades to impact fishers. Climate change also impacts recreational fishers by influencing environmental conditions that directly affect fishers (e.g., increased temperatures in northern climates resulting in extended open water fishing seasons and increased fishing effort). The final pathway occurs from climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts (e.g., refined energy policies result in higher fuel costs, making distant trips more expensive). To address limitations of past research (e.g., assessing climate change impacts for only one pathway at a time and not accounting for climate variability, extreme weather events, or heterogeneity among fishers), we encourage researchers to refocus their efforts to understand and document climate change impacts to inland fishers.","parentId":"542afbd9e4b057766eed290a","contacts":[{"name":"Len M.

This study evaluated multiple stream network fragmentation metrics representing localized (e.g., distance-to-dams) and cumulative (e.g., total upstream reservoir storage) dam influences on streams in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, developing an approach for identifying suitable fish indicators of dam effects. We used change point and correlation analyses to determine associations of stream fish catch per unit effort and various stream network fragmentation metrics with data from more than 2000 fish survey sites stratified by stream size, thermal regime, and ecoregion. Of the identified indicator species, predominantly warmwater, large river, and\/or lentic species were positively associated with stream network fragmentation, whereas cold and coolwater lotic species were negatively associated with fragmentation. These results suggest a combination of downstream thermal effects and upstream influences from impoundments generated by dams. Variance partitioning analyses based on identified indicator species revealed greater upstream-dominated dam influences in headwaters than mid-sized streams, and a greater relative influence of dams vs. other non-dam anthropogenic influences in cold streams than warm streams. Overall, a combination of localized and cumulative fragmentation metrics, as well as upstream and downstream-oriented measures, were influential in indicator species responses, emphasizing the importance of selecting a diversity of fragmentation metrics when assessing effects of dams on stream fishes. Understanding multiple dam influences on stream fishes, including localized effects from individual dams and cumulative effects from all dams within a river basin, would provide useful information for a variety of management activities, including dam operation and dam removal prioritization. Dams significantly affect conservation and management options for stream fishes, with identification of multi-scale dam influences on fishes being critical to restoration and maintenance of aquatic biodiversity throughout the world.","parentId":"50a6539fe4b0d446a665cab1","contacts":[{"name":"Arthur R.

and Melting Glaciers on Coastal Ecosystems in the Gulf of Alaska","body":"<p>As glaciers melt from climate change, their contents \u2013 namely, large quantities of freshwater, sediment, and nutrients \u2013 are slowly released into coastal ecosystems. This project addressed the impacts of melting glaciers on coastal ecosystems in the Copper River region of the Gulf of Alaska, which is home to several commercially important fisheries. Researchers examined how glacial melting is altering the amount and timing of freshwater that enters the Gulf of Alaska from the Copper River. They also investigated the source and amount of two nutrients, iron and nitrate, dissolved in the water. As a complementary piece of the study, researchers tested the relationship between nutrient levels, plankton populations, and the populations of fish that feed on plankton.<br> <br> Results show that substantial quantities of nutrients (e.g., up to hundreds of tons of iron) from glacial sediment are being added to the Copper River environment each year. Climate change, through accelerated glacial melting, may increase the quantity of nutrient additions to coastal ecosystems. Such changes would likely produce ecosystem changes \u2013 as high nutrient levels correspond with increased vegetation \u2013 but it is unknown what the exact changes would look like. One of the products of this research that may prove especially useful to natural resource managers is a model that shows how the present-day coastal ecosystem responds to seasonal changes in nutrient inputs as well as predictions about future ecosystem change in response to glacial melting in the coming decades.<\/p>","purpose":"FULL SUMMARY: This project addressed the impacts of climate change and melting glaciers on the fluxes of fresh water, and of the essential nutrients nitrate and iron, on the coastal ecosystem in the Copper River region of the Gulf of Alaska. The project included both terrestrial and marine components. The terrestrial part of this study focused on the Copper River and its tributaries, to examine how melting of glaciers is altering the magnitude and timing of freshwater supply from the Copper River, as well as the impact of glacier melting on the present and future supply of iron and nitrate from the river and from estuarine upwelling. The rates of glacier recession were assessed from remote sensing and physical observations of glaciers. The rate of discharge from the Copper River, and its contributions from precipitation, snowmelt, and glacier melting was inferred. A set of glaciated, deglaciated, and periglacial tributaries of the Copper River were sampled to examine present-day nutrient cycling in each of these settings, and to use a space-fortime substitution to make predictions about the future evolution of nutrients transported to the Gulf of Alaska from the Copper River. The flux and speciation of iron was examined, with the hypothesis that glaciated tributaries supply large amounts of reactive particulate iron that fuels a large dissolved iron pool in offshore waters, while deglaciated tributaries maintain wetlands that yield much lower particulate iron loads, yet promote dissolved oxygen carbon-rich waters with high dissolved iron concentrations. By contrast, glaciated tributaries were predicted to maintain low nitrate concentrations; however, immediately following deglaciation, alders and other nitrogen-fixing plants were predicted to establish themselves, leading to a much larger riverine nitrate load than occurred prior to the retreat of the glacier. As glaciers continue to recede, this invasion by nitrogen-fixing plants, and reduction in particulate iron load, has the potential to have a large impact on the present-day coastal, iron-rich, nitrogen-poor ecosystem. The marine component of this study built upon three research cruises per year to conduct transects from the Copper River mouth to beyond the shelf break. We studied the Copper River plume as a biological hotspot, examining both seasonal and interannnual change. The project tested the hypothesis that populations of fish, with critical lifestage requirements dependent on near-shore waters, are supported by phytoplankton and zooplankton populations, which are in turn controlled by nutrient inputs from glacier melt, riverine input, and the estuarine upwelling that results from freshwater inputs of these glacier-dominated rivers to the coast. Dissolved iron samples were collected using an underway pumping system, while underway measurements of nitrate, chl-a, turbidity, and zooplankton abundance were carried out using an undulating towed body. From a separate vessel, fish were enumerated with a surface trawl and their otoliths removed for later analysis. Data from these cruises were interpreted with the aid of physical oceanographic modeling and ecosystem modeling. The project resulted in several presentations and journal publications. The primary products that are useful to resource managers include the ecosystem model results that describe how the present-day coastal ecosystem responds to seasonal changes in snowmelt, glacier melt, precipitation, upwelling, and nutrient supply as well as the predictions about future ecosystem change in response to glacial recession in the coming decades.","parentId":"5050cc14e4b0be20bb30eac8","linkParentIds":["521e1ecde4b051c878dc356f"],"contacts":[{"name":"John Crusius","oldPartyId":2205,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jcrusius@usgs.gov","active":true,"firstName":"John","lastName":"Crusius","cellPhone":"5085242496","organization":{"displayText":"Alaska Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"2065436978","streetAddress":{"zip":"98195","country":"US","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","line1":"University Of WA, School Of Oceanography, Room G, Marine Science Building"},"buildingCode":"WWN","name":"John Crusius\/GD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"02543-1598","country":"USA","city":"Woods Hole","state":"MA","line1":"384 Woods Hole Road"},"building":"Ocean Sciences Building"}},{"name":"Robert Campbell","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"rcampbell@usgs.gov","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"W","lastName":"Campbell","organization":{"displayText":"Prince William Sound Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":{"zip":"57198-9801","country":"USA","city":"Sioux Falls","state":"SD","line1":"47914 252nd Street"},"buildingCode":"KMN","name":"Robert W Campbell\/GEOG\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"57198-9801","country":"USA","city":"Sioux Falls","state":"SD","line1":"47914 252nd Street"},"building":"Mundt Federal Building"}},{"name":"F.

What is not clear is&nbsp;whether migratory birds have adapted to these shifts in plant phenology by modifying the timing of migration&nbsp;and nesting. We examined whether long-term changes in phenology of spring&nbsp;vegetative green-up have occurred during the past 23-years in Alaska, and whether arctic and subarctic&nbsp;avian migrants have altered timing of migration or reproduction correspondingly. Failure to adapt to changes in&nbsp;plant phenology associated with climate change may put populations at risk because key northern wildlife&nbsp;events occur during periods of peak resource abundance.&nbsp;Our approach for this project was&nbsp;to assess historical and future changes in plant phenology relative to&nbsp;major climate drivers, and determine if the timing of spring green-up is synchronized across breeding areas or if&nbsp;the process has become fractured, potentially disrupting the timing of bird migration and breeding and putting&nbsp;species at risk. We used a time-series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)&nbsp;composites&nbsp;developed from historical satellite imagery (1985-2009) to derive vegetation phenology metrics. These metrics&nbsp;were then&nbsp;related to long-term data records on bird migration and breeding taken across Alaska. Projections&nbsp;of how climate will affect habitats in the future were made by linking our mapped phenology metrics for the&nbsp;major habitats of Alaska with downscaled climate models.&nbsp;The objective was to generate&nbsp;publications and a series of maps of past (1985-2009) and future&nbsp;(2009-2099) variability in phenology across major habitats of Alaska. These maps are accompanied by a&nbsp;trend analysis that illustrates the effects of these trends on migratory bird behavior across biomes. Alaska land&nbsp;managers can use the maps and downscaled climate projections of habitat change to identify key habitats and&nbsp;natural resource units that may need special management actions because of projected vulnerability, rarity, or&nbsp;importance to wildlife. The project outputs can also be used to predict which species will be most vulnerable to&nbsp;climate-induced changes and to develop landscape-level plans to conserve their populations and habitats.&nbsp;Collaborators in this project are the University of Alaska;&nbsp;the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;&nbsp;the US Fish and Wildlife Service;&nbsp;the National Park

in Reservoirs of the Upper Colorado River and Brazos River Basins, Texas","body":"This publication is a product from the 2009 project &quot;Modeling and Projecting the Influence of Climate Change on Texas Surface Waters and their Aquatic Biotic Communities&quot;. Abstract:&nbsp;Several reservoirs in the upper Colorado River and Brazos River basins in Texas have experienced toxic blooms of golden alga Prymnesium parvum and associated fish kills since 2001. There is a paucity of information, however, regarding the population-level effects of such kills in large reservoirs, species-specific resistance to or recovery from kills, or potential differences in the patterns of impacts among basins. We used multiple before\u2013after, control\u2013impact analysis to determine whether repeated golden alga blooms have led to declines in the relative abundance and size structure of fish populations. Sustained declines were noted for 9 of 12 fish species surveyed in the upper Colorado River, whereas only one of eight species was impacted by golden alga in the Brazos River. In the upper Colorado River, White Bass Morone chrysops, White Crappie Pomoxis annularis, Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, River Carpsucker Carpiodes carpio, Freshwater Drum Aplodinotus grunniens, Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus, Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris, and Blue Catfish I. furcatus exhibited sustained declines in relative abundance, size structure, or both; Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum, Longnose Gar Lepisosteus osseus, and Common Carp Cyprinus carpio did not exhibit those declines. In the Brazos River, only the relative abundance of Blue Catfish was impacted. Overall, toxic golden alga blooms can negatively impact fish populations over the long-term, but the patterns of impact can vary considerably among river basins and species. In the Brazos River, populations of most fish species appear to be healthy, suggesting a positive angling outlook for this basin. In the upper Colorado River, fish populations have been severely impacted, and angling opportunities have been reduced. Basin-specific management plans aimed at improving water quality and quantity will likely reduce bloom intensity and allow recovery of fish populations to the abundances and size structures present before golden alga.","parentId":"507480c2e4b090654e7b28f2","webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/00028487.2012.754786#.UebDbaXkuno","title":"VanLandeghem et al., 2013","hidden":false}],"dates":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-07-17T10:19:21.363-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2013-07-17T10:19:21.363-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0"},"5080548be4b0a0242ef28670":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/4f833a5ae4b0e84f608680b4","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Impacts of Low-Flow and Stream-Temperature Changes on Endangered Atlantic Salmon","relatedTitle":"Impact of Past and Future Stream Temperature and Flow Changes on Endangered Atlantic Salmon","id":"5080548be4b0a0242ef28670","relatedId":"4f833a5ae4b0e84f608680b4","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5080548be4b0a0242ef28670","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Impact of Past and Future Stream Temperature and Flow Changes on Endangered Atlantic Salmon","relatedTitle":"Impacts of Low-Flow and Stream-Temperature Changes on Endangered Atlantic Salmon","id":"4f833a5ae4b0e84f608680b4","relatedId":"5080548be4b0a0242ef28670","annotation":null}]},"id":"5080548be4b0a0242ef28670","title":"Impacts of Low-Flow and Stream-Temperature Changes on Endangered Atlantic Salmon","parentId":"505b4763e4b08c986b30c0e9","contacts":[{"name":"Robert W Dudley","type":"Author"},{"name":"Glenn A.

Detailed elevation data from 1995 and 2008 were compared with digital elevation models (DEMs) to assess marsh surface elevation change during this time. Overall, 37&nbsp;% (113&nbsp;ha) of the marsh increased in elevation at a rate that exceeded SLR, whereas 63&nbsp;% (196&nbsp;ha) of the area did not keep pace with SLR. Of the total area, 55&nbsp;% (169&nbsp;ha) subsided during the study period, but subsidence varied spatially across the marsh surface. To determine which biogeomorphic and spatial factors contributed to measured elevation change, we collected soil cores and determined percent and origin of organic matter (OM), particle size, bulk density (BD), and distance to nearest bay edge, levee, and channel. We then used Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) model selection to assess those variables most important to determine measured elevation change. Soil stable isotope compositions were evaluated to assess the source of the OM. The samples had limited percent OM by weight (&lt;5.5&nbsp;%), with mean bulk densities of 0.58&nbsp;g&nbsp;cm -3 , indicating that the soils had high mineral content with a relatively low proportion of pore space. The most parsimonious model with the highest AICc weight (0.53) included distance from bay's edge (i.e., lower intertidal) and distance from levee (i.e., upper intertidal). Close proximity to sediment source was the greatest factor in determining whether an area increased in elevation, whereas areas near landward levees experienced subsidence. Our study indicated that the ability of a marsh to keep pace with SLR varied across the surface, and assessing changes in elevation over time provides an alternative method to long-term accretion monitoring. SLR models that do not consider spatial variability of biogeomorphic and accretion processes may not correctly forecast marsh drowning rates, which may be especially true in modified and urbanized estuaries. In light of SLR, improving our understanding of elevation change in these dynamic marsh systems will play a crucial role in forecasting potential impacts to their sustainability and the survival of these ecosystems.","parentId":"50782a12e4b0df5513bf60f9","webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs12237-013-9725-x","title":"Thorne et al., 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-07","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-12-11T10:24:25.719-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2014-07-03T08:25:52.177-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Journal of the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI Number","value":"10.1007\/s12237-013-9725-x"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0"},"535547d5e4b0120853e8bc1f":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/4f833d4fe4b0e84f608680cf","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Importance of Understanding Landscape Biases in USGS Gage Locations: Implications and Solutions for Managers","relatedTitle":"Managing the Nation's Fish Habitat at Multiple Spatial Scales in a Rapidly Changing Climate","id":"535547d5e4b0120853e8bc1f","relatedId":"4f833d4fe4b0e84f608680cf","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/535547d5e4b0120853e8bc1f","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Managing the Nation's Fish Habitat at Multiple Spatial Scales in a Rapidly Changing Climate","relatedTitle":"Importance of Understanding Landscape Biases in USGS Gage Locations: Implications and Solutions for Managers","id":"4f833d4fe4b0e84f608680cf","relatedId":"535547d5e4b0120853e8bc1f","annotation":null}]},"id":"535547d5e4b0120853e8bc1f","title":"Importance of Understanding Landscape Biases in USGS Gage Locations: Implications and Solutions for Managers","parentId":"50747fffe4b090654e7b28ce","contacts":[{"name":"Jefferson Tyrell Deweber","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Pennsylvania Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Yin-Phan Tsang","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Michigan State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Damon M.

It is increasingly common for studies of animal ecology to use model-based predictions of environmental variables as explanatory or predictor variables, even though model prediction uncertainty is typically unknown. To demonstrate the potential for misleading inferences when model predictions with error are used in place of direct measurements, we compared snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow depth as predicted by the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) to field measurements of SWE and snow depth. We examined locations on elk (Cervus canadensis) winter ranges in western Wyoming, because modeled data such as SNODAS output are often used for inferences on elk ecology. Overall, SNODAS predictions tended to overestimate field measurements, prediction uncertainty was high, and the difference between SNODAS predictions and field measurements was greater in snow shadows for both snow variables compared to non-snow shadow areas. We used a simple simulation of snow effects on the probability of an elk being killed by a predator to show that, if SNODAS prediction uncertainty was ignored, we might have mistakenly concluded that SWE was not an important factor in where elk were killed in predatory attacks during the winter. In this simulation, we were interested in the effects of snow at finer scales (&lt;1 km<sup>2<\/sup>) than the resolution of SNODAS. If bias were to decrease when SNODAS predictions are averaged over coarser scales, SNODAS would be applicable to population-level ecology studies. In our study, however, averaging predictions over moderate to broad spatial scales (9\u20132200 km<sup>2<\/sup>) did not reduce the differences between SNODAS predictions and field measurements. This study highlights the need to carefully evaluate two issues when using model output as an explanatory variable in subsequent analysis: (1) the model\u2019s resolution relative to the scale of the ecological question of interest and (2) the implications of prediction uncertainty on inferences when using model predictions as explanatory or predictor variables.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["507465dee4b090654e7b2782"],"contacts":[{"name":"Faul C.

accelerated by climate change","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nclimate\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nclimate2252.html):&nbsp;Climate change will decrease worldwide biodiversity through a number of potential pathways1, including invasive hybridization2 (cross-breeding between invasive and native species). How climate warming influences the spread of hybridization and loss of native genomes poses difficult ecological and evolutionary questions with little empirical information to guide conservation management decisions3. Here we combine long-term genetic monitoring data with high-resolution climate and stream temperature predictions to evaluate how recent climate warming has influenced the spatio-temporal spread of human-mediated hybridization between threatened native westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi) and non-native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), the world\u2019s most widely introduced invasive fish4. Despite widespread release of millions of rainbow trout over the past century within the Flathead River system5, a large relatively pristine watershed in western North America, historical samples revealed that hybridization was prevalent only in one (source) population. During a subsequent 30-year period of accelerated warming, hybridization spread rapidly and was strongly linked to interactions between climatic drivers\u2014precipitation and temperature\u2014and distance to the source population. Specifically, decreases in spring precipitation and increases in summer stream temperature probably promoted upstream expansion of hybridization throughout the system. This study shows that rapid climate warming can exacerbate interactions between native and non-native species through invasive hybridization, which could spell genomic extinction for many species.","parentId":"50465251e4b0241d49d62c7c","linkParentIds":["506dd262e4b002b5ec71a9a3"],"contacts":[{"name":"Nature Publishing Group","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Clint C.

And, although the great majority of migration research has historically been conducted in the eastern half of the continent, there has been much recent progress on aspects of avian migration in the West. In particular, expanded use of techniques such as radar, plasma metabolites, mist-netting, count surveys, stable isotopes, genetic data, and animal tracking, coupled with an increase in multi-investigator collaborations, have all contributed to this growth of knowledge. There is increasing recognition that migration is likely the most limiting time of year for migratory birds, and this places increasing importance on continuing to decipher patterns of stopover ecology, identifying critical stopover habitats, and documenting migration routes in the diverse and changing landscapes of the American West. Here, we review and briefly synthesize the latest avian migration findings and advances and consider research needs to guide future research on migration in the West.&nbsp;","parentId":"5078277be4b0b3af9c7e6109","contacts":[{"name":"Jay Carlisle","oldPartyId":63047,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"jaycarlisle@boisestate.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Jay","lastName":"Carlisle","organization":{"displayText":"Boise State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Susan K Skagen","oldPartyId":9529,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"skagens@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Wildlife Biologist","firstName":"Susan","middleName":"K","lastName":"Skagen","organization":{"displayText":"Fort Collins Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9702269230","officePhone":"9702269461","streetAddress":{"zip":"80526","city":"Fort Collins","state":"CO","line1":"2150 Centre Avenue Bldg C"},"buildingCode":"KBA","name":"Susan K Skagen\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80526-8118","country":"USA","city":"Fort Collins","state":"CO","line1":"2150 Centre Avenue, Building C"},"building":"NRRC Bldg C"}},{"name":"Barbara E Kus","oldPartyId":5756,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"barbara_kus@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Supervisory Research Ecologist","firstName":"Barbara","middleName":"E","lastName":"Kus","organization":{"displayText":"San Diego Field Station, WERC"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"6192256436","officePhone":"6192256421","streetAddress":{"zip":"92140","city":"San Diego","state":"CA","line1":"4165 Spruance Road"},"buildingCode":"WCG","name":"Barbara E Kus\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"92101","country":"USA","city":"San Diego","state":"CA","line1":"4165 Spruance Road, Suite 200"},"building":"San Diego State University"}},{"name":"Charles Van Riper","oldPartyId":10664,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"charles_van_riper@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Scientist Emeritus","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Van Riper","organization":{"displayText":"Sonoran Desert Field Station, SBSC"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"5206267027","streetAddress":{"zip":"85719","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","line1":"1110 E.

LCCs are regional-applied conservation-science partnerships among Federal agencies, regional organizations, States, tribes, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), private stakeholders, universities, and other entities within a geographic area. The goal of these conservation-science partnerships is to help inform managers and decision makers at a landscape scale to further the principles of adaptive management and strategic habitat conservation. A major focus for LCCs is to help conservation managers and decision makers respond to large-scale ecosystem and habitat stressors, such as climate change, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, and water scarcity.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>The purpose of the PFLCC is to facilitate planning, design, and implementation of conservation strategies for fish and wildlife species at the landscape level using the adaptive management framework of strategic habitat conservation\u2014integrating planning, design, delivery, and evaluation. Florida faces a set of unique challenges when responding to regional and global stressors because of its unique ecosystems and assemblages of species, its geographic location at the crossroads of temperate and tropical climates, and its exposure to both rapid urbanization and rising sea levels as the climate warms.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>In response to these challenges, several landscape-scale science projects were initiated with the goal of informing decision makers about how potential changes in climate and the built environment could impact habitats and ecosystems of concern in Florida and the Southeast United States. In June 2012, the PFLCC, North Carolina State University, convened a workshop at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Coastal and Marine Science Center in St. Petersburg to assess the results of these integrated assessments and to foster an open dialogue about science gaps and future research needs.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5074680ae4b090654e7b27d0"],"contacts":[{"name":"Adam Terando","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Steve Traxler","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Jaime Collazo","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey","type":"Publisher"}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.er.usgs.gov\/publication\/ofr20141150","rel":"related","title":"Publications Warehouse Index Page","hidden":false},{"type":"pdf","uri":"https:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/of\/2014\/1150\/pdf\/ofr2014-1150.pdf","rel":"related","title":"Document","hidden":false},{"type":"browseImage","uri":"https:\/\/pubs.er.usgs.gov\/thumbnails\/ofr20141150.jpg","rel":"related","title":"Thumbnail","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"type":"Publication","scheme":"USGS Publications Warehouse","name":"Open-File Report"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-08-08T02:05:10.311-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-26T09:21:08.322-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","journal":"Open-File Report","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Publication Place","value":"Reston, VA"}],"language":"English","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Report"}],"files":[{"size":4026,"dateUploaded":"2014-08-31T09:07:54.018Z","name":"metadata5308624376013962604.xml","pathOnDisk":"__disk__8e\/8e\/c2\/8e8ec26969afc793545632636469549ea027e315","contentType":"application\/mods+xml","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/53e484b6e4b0fff4042801c7?f=__disk__8e%2F8e%2Fc2%2F8e8ec26969afc793545632636469549ea027e315"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/53e484b6e4b0fff4042801c7","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"Landscapeandcli.zip","files":""}],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","people":["Adam Terando","Steve Traxler","Jaime Collazo"]},"543c3950e4b0fd76af69c8cf":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/50a64a5ae4b0d446a665ca73","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Landscape-Scale Evaluation of Asymmetric Interactions between Brown Trout and Brook Trout Using Two-Species Occupancy Models","relatedTitle":"Projected Vulnerability of Brook Trout to Climate and Land Use Changes in the Eastern U.S. (Regional Assessment)","id":"543c3950e4b0fd76af69c8cf","relatedId":"50a64a5ae4b0d446a665ca73","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/543c3950e4b0fd76af69c8cf","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Projected Vulnerability of Brook Trout to Climate and Land Use Changes in the Eastern U.S. (Regional Assessment)","relatedTitle":"Landscape-Scale Evaluation of Asymmetric Interactions between Brown Trout and Brook Trout Using Two-Species Occupancy Models","id":"50a64a5ae4b0d446a665ca73","relatedId":"543c3950e4b0fd76af69c8cf","annotation":null}]},"id":"543c3950e4b0fd76af69c8cf","title":"Landscape-Scale Evaluation of Asymmetric Interactions between Brown Trout and Brook Trout Using Two-Species Occupancy Models","body":"Abstract (from http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/00028487.2012.734892#.VDw7ExYXNyg): Predicting the distribution of native stream fishes is fundamental to the management and conservation of many species. Modeling species distributions often consists of quantifying relationships between species occurrence and abundance data at known locations with environmental data at those locations. However, it is well documented that native stream fish distributions can be altered as a result of asymmetric interactions between dominant exotic and subordinate native species. For example, the naturalized exotic Brown Trout \n<em>Salmo trutta<\/em> has been identified as a threat to native Brook Trout \n<em>Salvelinus fontinalis<\/em> in the eastern United States. To evaluate large-scale patterns of co-occurrence and to quantify the potential effects of Brown Trout presence on Brook Trout occupancy, we used data from 624 stream sites to fit two-species occupancy models. These models assumed that asymmetric interactions occurred between the two species. In addition, we examined natural and anthropogenic landscape characteristics we hypothesized would be important predictors of occurrence of both species. Estimated occupancy for Brook Trout, from a co-occurrence model with no landscape covariates, at sites with Brown Trout present was substantially lower than sites where Brown Trout were absent. We also observed opposing patterns for Brook and Brown Trout occurrence in relation to percentage forest, impervious surface, and agriculture within the network catchment. Our results are consistent with other studies and suggest that alterations to the landscape, and specifically the transition from a forested catchment to one that contains impervious surface or agriculture, reduces the occurrence probability of wild Brook Trout. Our results, however, also suggest that the presence of Brown Trout results in lower occurrence probability of Brook Trout over a range of anthropogenic landscape characteristics, compared with streams where Brown Trout were absent.","parentId":"50a653f7e4b0d446a665cabc","contacts":[{"name":"Tyler Wagner","oldPartyId":10824,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"twagner@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Assistant Unit Leader Research Fish Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Tyler","lastName":"Wagner","organization":{"displayText":"Pennsylvania Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8148634710","officePhone":"8148654511","streetAddress":{"zip":"16802","city":"State College","state":"PA","line1":"419 Forest Resources Bldg, PA State Univ"},"buildingCode":"ALC","name":"Tyler Wagner\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"16802","country":"USA","city":"University Park","state":"PA","line1":"419 Forest Resources Building"},"building":"FOREST RESOURCES BUILDING"}},{"name":" Jefferson Tyrell Deweber ","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":""},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":" Jason Detar ","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission "},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":" John A.

To index such high-quality forage, recent work proposed the instantaneous rate of green-up (IRG), i.e. rate of change in the normalized difference vegetation index over time. Despite this important advancement, no study has tested the assumption that herbivores select habitat patches at peak IRG. We evaluated this assumption using step selection functions parametrized with movement data during the green-up period from two populations each of bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, moose and bison, totalling 463 individuals monitored 1\u20133 years from 2004 to 2014. Accounting for variables that typically influence habitat selection for each species, we found seven of 10 populations selected patches exhibiting high IRG\u2014supporting the GWH. Nonetheless, large herbivores selected for the leading edge, trailing edge and crest of the IRG wave, indicating that other mechanisms (e.g. ruminant physiology) or measurement error inherent with satellite data affect selection for IRG. Our evaluation indicates that IRG is a useful tool for linking herbivore movement with plant phenology, paving the way for significant advancements in understanding how animals track resource quality that varies both spatially and temporally.","materialRequestInstructions":"Please contact the authors to request this publication.","parentId":"5463acf2e4b0ba83040c6f80","contacts":[{"name":"Jerod A.

Beginning in 1989, Wisconsin implemented more restrictive harvest regulations for LMB, including greater minimum length limits, reduced bag limits, and a catch-and-release-only season during the spawning period across much of northern Wisconsin. We tested for trends in LMB relative abundance, growth, and angler catch and harvest in relation to LMB management policies from 1990 to 2011. We also tested for potential sport fish community responses to changes in LMB abundances using Walleye (WAE) Sander vitreus as an example. Angler catch rates and electrofishing catch per unit effort of LMB greater than 8 and 14 in increased significantly statewide. Mean length of age-6 LMB decreased significantly statewide. Release rates of LMB increased from about 80% in 1991 and then plateaued at more than 96% from 2005 to 2011. Concurrent with increases in LMB, adult WAE densities declined in lakes containing LMB. Ongoing research is being conducted to test for interactions between LMB and WAE and to test for additional environmental drivers, such as climate warming, that may be associated with increased LMB abundances. Largemouth Bass abundances have increased in Wisconsin, possibly in response to changes in harvest regulations, angler behavior, and potentially other environmental drivers. These increases in LMB abundances have had negative intraspecific effects on growth and may be negatively affecting WAE stocks. We recommend that management goals for LMB consider intra- and interspecific consequences, particularly in water bodies where multispecies fisheries are desired.&nbsp;","parentId":"54987053e4b07df8de5489d3","contacts":[{"name":"Jonathan F.

Songbirds","body":"Abstracts (from&nbsp;http:\/\/digitalcommons.unl.edu\/ncfwrustaff\/177\/):&nbsp;Climate change has increased worldwide temperatures, affected seasonal patterns, and altered important sources of natural selection. To manage wildlife populations successfully, we must understand how patterns and processes of climate change alter trade-offs between sources of selection to predict how individuals may respond, populations may evolve, and management actions may ameliorate the costs of changing climates. Here we discuss how the migratory patterns of leapfrog and chain migration facilitate or constrain responses by migratory songbirds to spatial and temporal variation in climate change across western North America. Based on 52 years of climate data, we show that changes in average minimum monthly temperature differ significantly between the spring migration zone in the desert Southwest and breeding locations throughout western North America, and that these differences are most extreme for populations breeding at low latitudes (37&deg;\u201349&deg;) and exacerbated for species exhibiting leapfrog migration. Given the importance of climate in the evolution of migratory behaviors, such extreme alterations in the geographical patterns of climate may ultimately threaten the long-term population viability of species dependent on low latitudes for breeding or exhibiting leapfrog migration.","parentId":"50746778e4b090654e7b27af","contacts":[{"name":"Joseph J Fontaine","oldPartyId":3300,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"jfontaine@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Assistant Unit Leader","firstName":"Joseph","middleName":"J","lastName":"Fontaine","organization":{"displayText":"Nebraska Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"4024722722","officePhone":"4024720339","streetAddress":{"zip":"68583","city":"Lincoln","state":"NE","line1":"University of Nebraska Lincoln"},"buildingCode":"KDA","name":"Joseph J Fontaine\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"68583-0984","country":"USA","city":"Lincoln","state":"NE","line1":"Univ. of Nebraska-Lincoln, 422 Hardin Hall, 3310 Holdrege St."},"building":"CRU COOP - NE FWRU - Hardin Hall"}},{"name":"Ryan J.

One way of coping with uncertainty is to manage for resilience to unanticipated events while facilitating learning through adaptive management. We outline the application of these strategies to freshwater recreational fisheries management using a case study in Wisconsin, USA, where black bass (Micropterus spp.) populations are increasing, while Walleye (Sander vitreus) populations are decreasing. Managing for heterogeneity in functional groups (e.g., age classes and prey species of sport fishes), fishery objectives, and regulations can increase resilience, although heterogeneity must be balanced with replication to facilitate learning. Monitoring designed to evaluate management objectives and inform about critical uncertainties, when combined with heterogeneity, creates opportunities for adaptive management, another critical resilience strategy. Although barriers exist to implementing resilience strategies, management designed to accommodate uncertainty and illuminate its consequences is needed to maintain critical fisheries in a rapidly changing world.","parentId":"54987053e4b07df8de5489d3","contacts":[{"name":"Gretchen J.

Water quality, major contributing-stream inflow, storage, local precipitation, and basin-wide total water withdrawals were analyzed. Inflow and storage decreased and total phosphorus increased in most reservoirs. The overall, warmest-, or coldest-monthly temperatures increased in 7 reservoirs, decreased in 1 reservoir, and did not significantly change in 3 reservoirs. The most common monotonic trend in salinity-related variables (specific conductance, chloride, sulfate) was one of no change, and when significant change occurred, it was inconsistent among reservoirs. No significant change was detected in monthly sums of local precipitation. Annual water withdrawals increased in both basins, but the increase was significant (P &lt; 0.05) only in the Colorado River and marginally significant (P &lt; 0.1) in the Brazos River. Salinity-related variables dominated spatial variability in water quality data due to the presence of high- and low-salinity reservoirs in both basins. These observations present a landscape in the Brazos and Colorado river basins where, in the last \u223c40 years, reservoir inflow and storage generally decreased, eutrophication generally increased, and water temperature generally increased in at least 1 of 3 temperature indicators evaluated. Because local precipitation remained generally stable, observed reductions in reservoir inflow and storage during the study period may be attributable to other proximate factors, including increased water withdrawals (at least in the Colorado River basin) or decreased runoff from contributing watersheds.","parentId":"507480c2e4b090654e7b28f2","contacts":[{"name":"Dan Dawson","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Texas Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Matthew M.

Forest managers are seeking strategies to increase forest resistance (minimizing negative impacts during the drought) and resilience (maximizing recovery rates following drought). Limited experimental evidence suggests that forests with particular structural characteristics have greater capacity to resist change and or recover ecosystem function in the face of drought. However, the applicability of these results to practical forest conservation and management remains unclear. We propose to utilize an existing network of eight long-term, operational-scale, forest management experiments to identify how established forest management prescriptions that include thinning and regeneration harvests can increase resistance and resilience of forest habitats to drought. We have preliminary evidence that certain forest thinning strategies, if sustained over several decades, can enhance resistance and resilience by manipulating forest structural conditions. By expanding upon those results, this project will 1) evaluate how past manipulations of forest stand structure have conferred drought resistance and resilience, and 2) characterize the long-term benefits to sustaining forest habitats of manipulating forest structure for minimizing adverse drought effects in forest ecosystems over the next several decades. Results will provide forest managers with insight into strategies that can help sustain forested habitats in the context of climate change. We propose to utilize an existing network of eight long-term forest management experiments to identify how established forest treatment practices can increase resistance and resilience of forest habitats to drought events. We are compiling data from these long-term experiments at sites ranging from Maine to Arizona, representing a broad array of forest types and regional climates. From preliminary examinations of a limited number of long-term plots, we have evidence that certain forest thinning strategies, if sustained over several decades, can enhance adaptation capacity by manipulating forest structure. In addition, our preliminary results (from a pilot study) clearly indicate that drought is an important driver of growth declines even in humid areas like New England, where ecohydrological controls are not widely recognized. This network of long-term experiments will allow us to characterize of drought impacts and identify promising management strategies across a very wide range of climatic conditions and forest habitats.","parentId":"55130bdbe4b02e76d75c074f","contacts":[{"name":"John B Bradford","oldPartyId":24226,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jbradford@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"John","middleName":"B","lastName":"Bradford","cellPhone":"9283804671","organization":{"displayText":"Colorado Plateau Field Station, SBSC"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9285569111","officePhone":"9285237766","streetAddress":{"zip":"86011","city":"Flagstaff","state":"AZ","line1":"PO BOX 5614 BLDG 56"},"buildingCode":"WZI","name":"John B Bradford\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"86011-5614","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"9394","city":"Flagstaff","state":"AZ","line1":"P.O.

Further, future climatic changes will continue to affect human land-use,&nbsp;temperature, and water flows. Natural resource managers need to identify and prioritize habitats&nbsp;so that limited time and funding can be focused on habitats that are in most need of protection both now and in the future, based on projected climate changes. This project was comprised of a team of scientists from the US Geological Survey,&nbsp;Kansas State University, Michigan State University, Penn State University, the University of&nbsp;Minnesota-Duluth, the University of Washington, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, and the&nbsp;Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Researchers modeled anticipated changes in fish habitat using&nbsp;downscaled global climate change models to predict alterations of water temperature, hydrology,&nbsp;and land-use under different possible scenarios.&nbsp;This project worked&nbsp;closely with the existing partnership-driven National Fish Habitat Action&nbsp;Plan (NFHAP) to link global climate change models and predicted land-use changes to the&nbsp;Nation\u2019s aquatic habitats. The effects of climate change on fish and fish habitat was&nbsp;conducted at three spatial scales. First, a coarse-scale nationwide assessment of how habitat will&nbsp;change with climate was&nbsp;conducted. Second, we used data specific to selected U.S.&nbsp;regions to refine our predicted changes in fish habitat among varying climate and land-use&nbsp;patterns in the Desert Southwest, the Rocky Mountain West, the Northern Glacial Lakes, and the Northeast&nbsp;U.S., and different aquatic systems such as warmwater rivers, glacial lakes, and coldwater streams.&nbsp;Finally, we also determined how selected fish distributions may change with altered climate.&nbsp;For example, the coldwater habitat needed for cisco in lakes in the Upper Midwest is diminishing&nbsp;and may affect the distribution of this critical species. We provided state and federal&nbsp;agencies, non-government organizations, and other stakeholders with GIS-based maps at&nbsp;national and regional scales, showing how habitat will change with climate and land-use change,&nbsp;and information on how those changes affect fish populations. A final report synthesizing this&nbsp;large effort was produced and distributed to all interested stakeholders, in addition to&nbsp;peer-reviewed publications for the scientific community. Lastly, the project trained five PhD students and post doctoral researchers so that these students can continue in&nbsp;their professional careers, helping resource managers deal with the effects of climate change. The&nbsp;project leveraged over $1 million in current partnership-driven nationwide and regional fish&nbsp;habitat assessments through the 300-member NFHAP. The results from this study will allow&nbsp;agencies to assess risks and determine how they will manage fish habitat and fish communities in&nbsp;a changing climate.<\/p>","parentId":"5050cc14e4b0be20bb30eac8","contacts":[{"name":"Craig Paukert","oldPartyId":7910,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS

and Projecting the Influence of Climate Change on Texas Surface Waters and their Aquatic Biotic Communities","body":"<p>Water scarcity is a growing concern in Texas, where surface water is derived almost entirely from rainfall. Changes in air temperature and precipitation patterns associated with global climate change are anticipated to regionally affect the quality and quantity of inland surface waters and consequently their suitability as habitat for freshwater life. In addition to directly affecting resident organisms and populations, these changes in physicochemical traits of aquatic habitats may favor the establishment of harmful invasive species.&nbsp;As conflicts over the use of water resources grow in intensity, this information will become important for fish and wildlife managers to anticipate impacts of climate change on trust resources and to evaluate their management options. This&nbsp;project had four objectives: (1) to assemble an electronic database of observed historical water temperatures and other relevant water quality information for selected reservoirs in Texas with significant fisheries resource status; (2) to combine historical records of reservoir water quality, air temperature, and precipitation with projected climate changes to develop statistical models capable of projecting the potential impacts of future climate change on patterns of water temperature and quality in the selected reservoirs; (3) to assess the impact of the projected changes on the physical and chemical environment and on aquatic populations and communities; and (4) to conduct a retrospective analysis of relations that may exist between historical changes in water quality and the relatively recent spread of a harmful invasive species in Texas, golden alga.&nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"5050cc14e4b0be20bb30eac8","contacts":[{"name":"Reynaldo

in size and its existing wetland hydrology has been altered. The endangered snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis) has nearly abandoned the Everglades, and its prey, the apple snail (Pomacea paludosa), has declined.<\/p> \n<\/div> \n<div> \n <h3>Objective<\/h3> \n <p>We developed a population model (EverSnail) to understand apple snail response to inter- and intra-annual fluctuations in water depths over the Everglades landscape. EverSnail was developed as a tool to understand how apple snails respond to different hydrologic scenarios.&nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> <strong>Methods<\/strong><\/p> \n<\/div> \n<div> \n <p>EverSnail is an age- and size-structured, spatially-explicit landscape model of&nbsp;P. paludosa&nbsp;in the Everglades. Landscape-level inputs are water depth and air temperature. We conducted sensitivity analyses by running EverSnail with &plusmn;20&nbsp;% the baseline value of eight parameters.<\/p> \n<\/div> \n<div> \n <h3>Results<\/h3> \n <p>EverSnail was sensitive to changes in survival and water depth associated with reproduction. The EverSnail population varied with changes and\/or differences in depth generally consistent with empirical data; site-specific comparisons to field data proved less reliable. A simulated 3-year wet period resulted in a shift in apple snail distribution, but little change in total abundance over the landscape. In contrast, a simulated 3-year succession of relatively dry years resulted in overall lower snail abundances.<\/p> \n<\/div> \n<div> \n <h3>Conclusions<\/h3> \n <p>Comparisons of model output to empirical data indicate the need for more data to better understand, and eventually parameterize, several aspects of snail ecology in support of EverSnail. A primary value of EverSnail is its capacity to describe the relative response of snail abundance to alternative hydrologic scenarios considered for Everglades water management and restoration.<\/p> \n<\/div>","parentId":"507466bce4b090654e7b278d","contacts":[{"name":"Springer Netherlands","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Philip C.

Current research is being funded by USGS through the National Climate Change Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC) and the Science Support Partnership (SSP) Program that is held by the USGS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The national mission of the NCCWSC is to improve the capacity of fish and wildlife agencies to respond to climate change and to address high-priority climate change effects on fish and wildlife. Within the national context, the NCCWSC research on the Missouri River focuses on temporal and spatial downscaling and associated uncertainty in modeling climate change effects on sturgeon species in the Missouri River.

In addition, many mussel species are living in habitats that push the upper limits of their heat tolerance, which may become problematic as the climate and, as a result, water temperatures warm. As part of this project, we created a set of models to predict how freshwater mussels would respond to climate change effects. Our primary objective was to help federal and state natural resource managers forecast how mussel species will respond to climate change over the next 30 to&nbsp;50 years, so that managers can develop appropriate adaptation strategies to address these changes. Additionally, through this project, we aimed to generate new data to help refine and improve our models and predictions. We conducted laboratory and field studies investigating mussel sensitivity to temperature, sediment, streamflow, and habitat availability and quality. The results of these studies show, in part, that climate change has the potential to further imperil freshwater mussel species. For example, in warmer water temperatures, adult and juvenile mussels exhibit symptoms of stress, including slower heart rate and less burrowing activity, which leaves them exposed to predators.

In particular, the fate of the Arctic Ocean, which provides critical habitat to commercially important fish, is in question. This poses an intriguing problem for future research of Arctic environments - one that will require examination of long-term SST records. This publication describes and provides access to an easy-to-use Arctic SST dataset for ecologists, biogeographers, oceanographers, and other scientists conducting research on habitats and\/or processes in the Arctic Ocean. The data cover the Arctic ecoregions as defined by the \"Marine Ecoregions of the World\" (MEOW) biogeographic schema developed by The Nature Conservancy as well as the region to the north from approximately 46\u00b0N to about 88\u00b0N (constrained by the season and data coverage). The data span a 29-year period from September 1981 to December 2009. These SST data were derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument measurements that had been compiled into monthly means at 4-kilometer grid cell spatial resolution. The processed data files are available in ArcGIS geospatial datasets (raster and point shapefiles) and also are provided in text (.csv) format. All data except the raster files include attributes identifying latitude\/longitude coordinates, and realm, province, and ecoregion as defined by the MEOW classification schema. A seasonal analysis of these Arctic ecoregions reveals a wide range of SSTs experienced throughout the Arctic, both over the course of an annual cycle and within each month of that cycle. Sea ice distribution plays a major role in SST regulation in all Arctic ecoregions.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50748153e4b090654e7b291e"],"contacts":[{"name":"Meredith C.

Over a 50-yr period, we examined trends in the timing of the first arrival for 16 avian migrant species at the terminus of their northward migration along the central Arctic coast of Alaska and compared these trends to factors potentially influencing migration phenology.

Local climatic variables, particularly temperature, had a greater effect on a species first arrival date than did large-scale climatic predictors. First arrival date was 1.03 d earlier for every 1\u00b0C annual change in temperature, but there was nearly a 2-fold difference in the range of responses across species (0.69\u20131.33 d \u00b0C<\/span><sup>\u22121<\/sup><span>), implying that some species did better than others at timing their arrival with changing temperature. There was weak support for an influence of foraging strategy, migration distance, and flight path on timing of first arrival. Our findings, like others from temperate latitudes, indicate that avian migrants are responsive to changing environmental conditions, though some species appear to be more adaptive than others.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50747fb5e4b090654e7b28bb"],"contacts":[{"name":"David Ward","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"dward@usgs.gov"},{"name":"J.

The Great Lakes have experienced environmental stressors that may have changed population demographics and stock-recruitment relationships while causing the declines of several prey fish species, including rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). We investigated changes in the size and maturation of rainbow smelt in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron and recruitment dynamics of the Lake Michigan stock over the past four decades. Mean lengths and length-at-maturation of rainbow smelt generally declined over time in both lakes. To evaluate recruitment, we used both a Ricker model and a Kalman filter-random walk (KF-RW) model which incorporated nonstationarity in stock productivity by allowing the productivity term to vary over time. The KF-RW model explained nearly four times more variation in recruitment than the Ricker model, indicating the productivity of the Lake Michigan stock has increased. By accounting for this nonstationarity, we were able identify significant variations in stock productivity, evaluate its importance to rainbow smelt recruitment, and speculate on potential environmental causes for the shift. Our results suggest that investigating mechanisms driving nonstationary shifts in stock-recruit relationships can provide valuable insights into temporal variation in fish population dynamics.","parentId":"507468aee4b090654e7b27e6","contacts":[{"name":"Zachary S.

Despite accelerated climate change in the Arctic, few studies have examined nest phenology shifts in arctic breeding species. We investigated whether CIDs have advanced for the most abundant breeding shorebird and passerine species at a long-term monitoring site in arctic Alaska. We pooled data from three additional nearby sites to determine the explanatory power of snow melt and ecological variables (predator abundance, green-up) on changes in breeding phenology. As predicted, all species (semipalmated sandpiper,&nbsp; \n<em>Calidris pusilla<\/em>, pectoral sandpiper,&nbsp; \n<em>Calidris melanotos<\/em>, red-necked phalarope,&nbsp; \n<em>Phalaropus lobatus<\/em>, red phalarope,&nbsp; \n<em>Phalaropus fulicarius<\/em>, Lapland longspur,&nbsp; \n<em>Calcarius lapponicus<\/em>) exhibited advanced CIDs ranging from 0.40 to 0.80&nbsp;days\/year over 9&nbsp;years. Timing of snow melt was the most important variable in explaining clutch initiation advancement (\u201cclimate\/snow hypothesis\u201d) for four of the five species, while green-up was a much less important explanatory factor. We found no evidence that high predator abundances led to earlier laying dates (\u201cpredator\/re-nest hypothesis\u201d). Our results support previous arctic studies in that climate change in the cryosphere will have a strong impact on nesting phenology although factors explaining changes in nest phenology are not necessarily uniform across the entire Arctic. Our results suggest some arctic-breeding shorebird and passerine species are altering their breeding phenology to initiate nesting earlier enabling them to, at least temporarily, avoid the negative consequences of a trophic mismatch.","parentId":"50747fb5e4b090654e7b28bb","contacts":[{"name":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","organization":{"displayText":""},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"J.

Climate change is expected to alter the synchronized relationship between the timing of migratory bird arrival and nesting on breeding grounds, and the peak availability of key food sources such as insects. As temperatures rise, trees and plants generally flower earlier, and associated insects also peak earlier. Yet migratory birds may not be able to sufficiently advance their migration to maintain optimal food availability for their young. Using historical data on the timing of bird migration and tree flowering (an indicator of food availability), this project will calculate annual phenological synchrony and overlap (where synchrony is the temporal difference between peak bird presence and peak tree flowering, and overlap is the portion of co-occurring bird presence and tree flowering). In addition to evaluating the effect of climate change on changes in overlap and synchrony, this project will also analyze differences in trends between various groups of migratory birds (i.e., long- versus short-distance migrants), thereby shedding light on the ecological mechanisms driving phenological responses to climate change in migratory birds.","parentId":"55130bdbe4b02e76d75c074f","contacts":[{"name":"Madeleine A Rubenstein","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"mrubenstein@usgs.gov","active":true,"firstName":"Madeleine","middleName":"A","lastName":"Rubenstein","organization":{"displayText":"USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"7036484044","officePhone":"7036484072","streetAddress":{"zip":"20192","country":"US","city":"Reston","state":"VA","line1":"12201 Sunrise Valley Dr"},"buildingCode":"AAA","name":"CN=Madeleine A Rubenstein,OU=CLU,OU=Users,OU=OITS,OU=DI,DC=gs,DC=doi,DC=net -

Nevertheless, observing and quantifying how climate change affects behavior, distribution, and abundance of wildlife is difficult because of the long time scales over which the ecological consequences of climate are manifest. &nbsp;In response to seasonal changes in plant growth and phenology, and local climatic conditions, temperate ungulates commonly migrate between high-elevation summer ranges and low-elevation winter ranges.&nbsp; Long-distance ungulate migration has captured the attention of scientists and nonscientists alike. &nbsp;Despite the compelling nature of these arduous journeys, our understanding of migration is still limited. &nbsp;\n<br> \n<br> This work has the following objectives: \n<strong> <\/strong>(1)&nbsp; Evaluate how well mule deer track plant phenology (i.e., Green Wave Hypothesis), both during migration and while on summer range;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp; Connect fine-scale patterns of vegetation quality (i.e., protein content and digestibility) and real-time deer diets (from fecal microhistology) to remotely sensed plant phenology (NDVI) by tracking deer, forage plants, and diets at stopover sites used during migration;&nbsp;(3) &nbsp;Evaluate how landscape characteristics affect the landscape homogeneity of phenological patterns encountered by deer on stopovers and summer range and how drought may influence the ability of deer to track plant phenology;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp; Determine the relative benefit of phenological tracking - and how it is altered by drought - for individual mule deer by relating phenology tracking to summer fat gain, demographic performance, and population growth. &nbsp;","parentId":"53beaa25e4b0527d5d411803","contacts":[{"name":"Matthew J Kauffman","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"mkauffman@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Unit Leader","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Matthew","middleName":"J","lastName":"Kauffman","organization":{"displayText":"Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"3077665400","officePhone":"3077665415","streetAddress":{"zip":"82071","city":"Laramie","state":"WY","line1":"UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING  BOX 3166, 16th & Gibbon Streets"},"buildingCode":"KOB","name":"Matthew J Kauffman\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"82071-3166","country":"USA","city":"Laramie","state":"WY","line1":"Univ. of WY, Biological Sci Bldg, 1000 E.

Colonies Vulnerable to Sea\u2010Level Rise","body":"Abstract (from http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1523-1739.2012.01853.x\/abstract): Globally, seabirds are vulnerable to anthropogenic threats both at sea and on land. Seabirds typically nest colonially and show strong fidelity to natal colonies, and such colonies on low-lying islands may be threatened by sea-level rise. We used French Frigate Shoals, the largest atoll in the Hawaiian Archipelago, as a case study to explore the population dynamics of seabird colonies and the potential effects sea-level rise may have on these rookeries. We compiled historic observations, a 30-year time series of seabird population abundance, lidar-derived elevations, and aerial imagery of all the islands of French Frigate Shoals. To estimate the population dynamics of 8 species of breeding seabirds on Tern Island from 1980 to 2009, we used a Gompertz model with a Bayesian approach to infer population growth rates, density dependence, process variation, and observation error. All species increased in abundance, in a pattern that provided evidence of density dependence. Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor), Masked Boobies (Sula dactylatra), Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda), Spectacled Terns (Onychoprion lunatus), and White Terns (Gygis alba) are likely at carrying capacity. Density dependence may exacerbate the effects of sea-level rise on seabirds because populations near carrying capacity on an island will be more negatively affected than populations with room for growth. We projected 12% of French Frigate Shoals will be inundated if sea level rises 1 m and 28% if sea level rises 2 m. Spectacled Terns and shrub-nesting species are especially vulnerable to sea-level rise, but seawalls and habitat restoration may mitigate the effects of sea-level rise. Losses of seabird nesting habitat may be substantial in the Hawaiian Islands by 2100 if sea levels rise 2 m. Restoration of higher-elevation seabird colonies represent a more enduring conservation solution for Pacific seabirds.","parentId":"5074818fe4b090654e7b292e","contacts":[{"name":"Jeffrey S Hatfield","oldPartyId":4323,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"jhatfield@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Jeffrey","middleName":"S","lastName":"Hatfield","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"3014975666","officePhone":"3014975633","streetAddress":{"zip":"20708","country":"US","city":"Laurel","state":"MD","line1":"12100 Beech Forest Road"},"buildingCode":"ACE","name":"Jeffrey S Hatfield\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"20708","country":"USA","city":"Laurel","state":"MD","line1":"12100 Beech Forest Road"},"building":"Gabrielson Lab"}},{"name":"Michelle H Reynolds","oldPartyId":8560,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"mreynolds@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Wildlife Biologist","firstName":"Michelle","middleName":"H","lastName":"Reynolds","organization":{"displayText":"Kilauea Field Station, PIERC"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8089678568","officePhone":"8089856416","streetAddress":{"zip":"96718","country":"US","city":"Hawaii National Park","state":"HI","line1":"P.O Box 44\r\nCrater Rim drive\r\nBld 344"},"buildingCode":"WHF","name":"Michelle H Reynolds\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"96718","country":"USA","city":"Hawaii National Park","state":"HI","line1":"P.O.

We used the U.S. Geological Survey's Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) to model watershed hydrological processes under current and future climatic conditions. This model allowed us to explore possible shifts in coastal hydrologic regimes at a range of spatial scales. All modeled watersheds are located in rainfall-dominated coastal areas with relatively insignificant base flow inputs, and their areas vary from 74.3 to 2,747.6 square kilometers. The watersheds also vary in mean elevation, ranging from 147 meters in the Willapa to 1,179 meters in the Coquille. The latitudes of watershed centroids range from 43.037 degrees north latitude in the Coquille River estuary to 46.629 degrees north latitude in Willapa Bay. We calibrated model parameters using historical climate grid data downscaled to one-sixteenth of a degree by the Climate Impacts Group, and historical runoff from sub-watersheds or neighboring watersheds. Nash Sutcliffe efficiency values for daily flows in calibration sub-watersheds ranged from 0.71 to 0.89. After calibration, we forced the PRMS models with four North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program climate models: Canadian Regional Climate Model-(National Center for Atmospheric Research) Community Climate System Model version 3, Canadian Regional Climate Model-Canadian Global Climate Model version 3, Hadley Regional Model version 3-Hadley Centre Climate Model version 3, and Regional Climate Model-Canadian Global Climate Model version 3. These are global climate models (GCMs) downscaled with regional climate models that are embedded within the GCMs, and all use the A2 carbon emission scenario developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. With these climate-forcing outputs, we derived the mean change in flow from the period encompassing the 1980s (1971-1995) to the period encompassing the 2050s (2041-2065). Specifically, we calculated percent change in mean monthly flow rate, coefficient of variation, top 5 percent of flow, and 7-day low flow. The trends with the most agreement among climate models and among watersheds were increases in autumn mean monthly flows, especially in October and November, decreases in summer monthly mean flow, and increases in the top 5 percent of flow. We also estimated variance in PRMS outputs owing to parameter uncertainty and the selection of climate model using Latin hypercube sampling. This analysis showed that PRMS low-flow simulations are more uncertain than medium or high flow simulations, and that variation among climate models was a larger source of uncertainty than the hydrological model parameters. These results improve our understanding of how climate change may affect the saltwater-freshwater balance in Pacific Northwest estuaries, with implications for their sensitive ecosystems.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50748153e4b090654e7b291e"],"contacts":[{"name":"Madeline O.

For assessing potential changes in fish growth, we contrasted simulated fish growth in the projected future climate regime during the period 2043-2070 under different prey availability scenarios with the simulated growth during the baseline (historical reference) period 1964-1993. Results showed that effects of climate change on the growth of these two fishes are jointly controlled by behavioral thermoregulation and prey availability. With the ability of behavioral thermoregulation, temperatures experienced by yellow perch in the projected future climate regime increased more than those experienced by lake whitefish. Thus simulated future growth decreased more for yellow perch than for lake whitefish under scenarios where prey availability remains constant into the future. Under high prey availability scenarios, simulated future growth of these two fishes both increased but yellow perch could not maintain the baseline efficiency of converting prey consumption into body weight. We contended that thermal guild should not be the only factor used to predict effects of climate change on the growth of a fish, and that ecosystem responses to climate change should be also taken into account.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["507468aee4b090654e7b27e6"],"contacts":[{"name":"Yu-Chun Kao","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Charles P.

When surface water is unavailable, the only source of water for ungulates comes from the forage they consume, and they must make resourceful foraging decisions to meet their requirements. We compared two desert bighorn sheep ( \n<em>Ovis canadensis nelsoni<\/em>) populations in Arizona, USA: a treatment population with supplemental water removed during treatment, and a control population. We examined whether sheep altered their seasonal diets without supplemental water. We calculated water and nutrient intake and metabolic water production from dry matter intake and forage moisture and nitrogen content, to determine whether sheep could meet their seasonal daily water and nutrient requirements solely from forage. Diets of sheep were higher in protein (all seasons) and moisture (autumn and winter) during treatment compared to pretreatment. During treatment, sheep diet composition was similar between the treatment and control populations, which suggests, under the climatic conditions of this study, water removal did not influence sheep diets. We estimated that under drought conditions, without any surface water available (although small ephemeral potholes would contain water after rains), female and male sheep would be unable to meet their daily water requirements in all seasons, except winter, when reproductive females had a nitrogen deficit. We determined that sheep could achieve water and nutrient balances in all seasons by shifting their total diet proportions by 8\u201355% from lower to higher moisture and nitrogen forage species. We elucidate how seasonal forage quality and foraging decisions by desert ungulates allow them to cope with their xeric and uncertain environment, and suggest that, with the forage conditions observed in our study area during this study period, providing supplemental water during water-stressed periods may not be necessary for desert bighorn sheep.","parentId":"52742218e4b097f32ac3f3f6","contacts":[{"name":"Jay V.

Although previous research has suggested that projected climate warming may allow SMB to thrive beyond their current northern distribution, little research has been devoted to the population-level effects of climate change on warm-water fishes, including SMB. We modelled the impacts of projected climate change on growth of stream-dwelling SMB along a north\u2013south gradient in the central USA. Using downscaled regional projections from three global climate models, we generated scenarios for thermal habitat change for four populations (in Oklahoma, Missouri, Iowa and Minnesota) and used bioenergetics simulations to estimate prey consumption and growth under future projections. Bioenergetics simulations showed that prey consumption is expected to increase in all populations with moderate stream warming (2\u20133 &deg;C). Growth potential is predicted to increase by 3\u201317% if not limited by food availability with stream warming by 2060 and was most pronounced for southern populations. For each 1 &deg;C increase in stream temperature, SMB consumption would be expected to increase by about 27% and growth would increase by about 6%. Due to implications for species interactions, population performance and regulation of local fisheries, a better understanding of how SMB populations will respond to climate change is recommended for effective management and conservation.","parentId":"50a65543e4b0d446a665cad0","webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/eff.12084\/abstract","title":"Pease & Paukert, 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-07","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-07-29T11:54:56.937-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2014-07-17T12:01:36.081-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Ecology of Freshwater Fish","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Volume","value":"23"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Issue ","value":"3"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Pages","value":"336-346"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI Number","value":"10.1111\/eff.12084"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0"},"53ea3cffe4b008eaa4f4c453":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"53ea3cffe4b008eaa4f4c453","title":"Predicted Climate Change Effects on Fisheries Habitat and Production in the Great Lakes","body":"Great Lakes fishery managers and stakeholders have little information regarding how climate change could&nbsp;affect the management and conservation of fish populations, including those of high recreational and&nbsp;commercial value.

\n<em>Salvelinus fontinalis<\/em>&nbsp;is an important species of conservation concern in the eastern USA. We developed a model to predict Brook Trout population status within individual stream reaches throughout the species\u2019 native range in the eastern USA. We utilized hierarchical logistic regression with Bayesian estimation to predict Brook Trout occurrence probability, and we allowed slopes and intercepts to vary among ecological drainage units (EDUs). Model performance was similar for 7,327 training samples and 1,832 validation samples based on the area under the receiver operating curve (\u223c0.78) and Cohen's kappa statistic (0.44). Predicted water temperature had a strong negative effect on Brook Trout occurrence probability at the stream reach scale and was also negatively associated with the EDU average probability of Brook Trout occurrence (i.e., EDU-specific intercepts). The effect of soil permeability was positive but decreased as EDU mean soil permeability increased. Brook Trout were less likely to occur in stream reaches surrounded by agricultural or developed land cover, and an interaction suggested that agricultural land cover also resulted in an increased sensitivity to water temperature. Our model provides a further understanding of how Brook Trout are shaped by habitat characteristics in the region and yields maps of stream-reach-scale predictions, which together can be used to support ongoing conservation and management efforts. These decision support tools can be used to identify the extent of potentially suitable habitat, estimate historic habitat losses, and prioritize conservation efforts by selecting suitable stream reaches for a given action. Future work could extend the model to account for additional landscape or habitat characteristics, include biotic interactions, or estimate potential Brook Trout responses to climate and land use changes.","parentId":"50a653f7e4b0d446a665cabc","contacts":[{"name":"Tyrell Deweber","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Pennsylvania Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, Pennsylvania State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Tyler Wagner","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey, Pennsylvania Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"NCCWSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/00028487.2014.963256#abstract","title":"DeWeber and Wagner 2015","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Eastern Brook Trout"},{"name":"Occurrence Probability"},{"name":"Climate Change"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-12-01","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-03-26T07:24:43.471-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-26T07:33:43.752-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Transactions of the American Fisheries Society","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1080\/00028487.2014.963256"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Pages ","value":"11-24"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Volume","value":"144"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Issue","value":"1"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","people":["Tyrell Deweber","Tyler Wagner"],"orgs":["NCCWSC"]},"520e2b00e4b08494c3cb0648":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/4f833d90e4b0e84f608680d3","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Predicting Climate Change Threats to Estuaries in the Pacific Northwest","relatedTitle":"Predicting Climate Change Threats to Key Estuarine Habitats and Ecosystem Services in the Pacific Northwest","id":"520e2b00e4b08494c3cb0648","relatedId":"4f833d90e4b0e84f608680d3","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/520e2b00e4b08494c3cb0648","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Predicting Climate Change Threats to Key Estuarine Habitats and Ecosystem Services in the Pacific Northwest","relatedTitle":"Predicting Climate Change Threats to Estuaries in the Pacific Northwest","id":"4f833d90e4b0e84f608680d3","relatedId":"520e2b00e4b08494c3cb0648","annotation":null}]},"id":"520e2b00e4b08494c3cb0648","title":"Predicting Climate Change Threats to Estuaries in the Pacific Northwest","parentId":"50748153e4b090654e7b291e","webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/webinar\/116","title":"Project Webinar","hidden":false}],"dates":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-08-16T07:37:04.229-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2013-08-16T07:37:04.229-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0"},"4f833d90e4b0e84f608680d3":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"4f833d90e4b0e84f608680d3","title":"Predicting Climate Change Threats to Key Estuarine Habitats and Ecosystem Services in the Pacific Northwest","body":"<p>Global climate change and sea-level rise will have profound effects on estuarine fish,&nbsp;shellfish and wildlife populations and their habitats. Our ability to manage sustainable fish,&nbsp;shellfish and other wildlife populations in the future will be seriously compromised unless we&nbsp;have a basic understanding of the coming changes and use this to develop mitigation and&nbsp;adaptation measures. The overall objective of this multi-agency research is to develop the&nbsp;baseline climatic and biological data, models, and tools to predict the cumulative impact of&nbsp;climate change on habitats and ecosystem services in a series of coastal estuaries of the Pacific&nbsp;Northwest. In collaboration with other federal, state, and non-governmental organization partners, USGS scientists developed predictions of climate-related alterations of the distribution and abundance of oysters&nbsp;and seagrass, both of which provide critical habitats that serve as nurseries for estuarine fishes&nbsp;and crabs. In addition, the project looked at climate impacts to tidal marsh, including effects&nbsp;on wetland restoration and juvenile salmon habitat. The research provides insights into future&nbsp;changes that impact wildlife and economically important species, and helps land managers&nbsp;understand the ramifications of the changes that are coming and what those changes may mean&nbsp;for both wildlife and the ecosystem services provided by these estuaries.&nbsp;Partner and collaborator organizations included in this research were the Oregon Climate Change&nbsp;Research Institute, the US Environmental Protection Agency, the US Fish and Wildlife Agency, the US Department of&nbsp;Agriculture, the US Forest&nbsp;Service, The Nature

the Glacial Lakes Region under Changing Land Use and Climate Regimes (Local Assessment)","body":"<p>The goal of the glacial lakes regional study was to predict the impacts of climate&nbsp;and land use change on coldwater fish habitat in the glacial lakes region, which covers&nbsp;most of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The study includes both top-level, regional analyses and more detailed case studies of individual lakes. The goal of this project was to provide (1)&nbsp;projections of land use and climate change impacts on the trophic status of Midwestern coldwater glacial lakes, (2)&nbsp;projections of land use and climate change impacts on the regional distribution of coldwater lake oxythermal habitat, and (3)&nbsp;guidance on the types of coldwater lakes in which locations will be the most or&nbsp;least vulnerable to land use and climate change. To do so, methods were developed for conducting&nbsp;regional analyses of large numbers of coldwater lakes, including models for watershed nutrient loading and lake response models.&nbsp;Retrospective analyses were also conducted on trends in ice-out, water temperature, and fish assemblages in Minnesota\u2019s lakes, based on historic data. These models can then be used to help inform management decisions regarding the protection and restoration of lakes and their watersheds with respect to maintenance of cold water refugia under future climate and land use scenarios. The goal of this project was to produce a&nbsp;Watershed Nutrient Loading Model and a Lake Response Model.The former is comprised of regional models&nbsp;for nutrient loading to coldwater lakes that will enable prediction of the changes in lake nutrient loading and concentration in response to changes in land use and climate.&nbsp;Meanwhile, the latter is a&nbsp;deterministic lake model (MINLAKE)&nbsp;calibrated for current conditions for a set of coldwater Cisco lakes in Minnesota. The calibrated models can then be used to predict changes in habitat (temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles) in response to climate change for several global climate change scenarios. The final project objective was to develop&nbsp;an online web application to aid in visualization, inter-model comparison, and data dissemination of dynamically downscaled climate simulations based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&nbsp;emission scenarios.<\/p> \n<div>\n &nbsp;\n<\/div>","parentId":"5050cc14e4b0be20bb30eac8","contacts":[{"name":"Lucinda Johnson","type":"Principal

rise vulnerability of terrestrial habitat and wildlife of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands","body":"If current climate change trends continue, rising sea levels may inundate low-lying islands across the globe, placing island biodiversity at risk. Recent models predict a rise of approximately one meter (1 m) in global sea level by 2100, with larger increases possible in areas of the Pacific Ocean. Pacific Islands are unique ecosystems home to many endangered endemic plant and animal species. The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), which extend 1,930 kilometers (km) beyond the main Hawaiian Islands, are a World Heritage Site and part of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. These NWHI support the largest tropical seabird rookery in the world, providing breeding habitat for 21 species of seabirds, 4 endemic land bird species and essential foraging, breeding, or haul-out habitat for other resident and migratory wildlife. In recent years, concern has grown about the increasing vulnerability of the NWHI and their wildlife populations to changing climatic patterns, particularly the uncertainty associated with potential impacts from global sea-level rise (SLR) and storms. In response to the need by managers to adapt future resource protection strategies to climate change variability and dynamic island ecosystems, we have synthesized and down scaled analyses for this important region. This report describes a 2-year study of a remote northwestern Pacific atoll ecosystem and identifies wildlife and habitat vulnerable to rising sea levels and changing climate conditions. A lack of high-resolution topographic data for low-lying islands of the NWHI had previously precluded an extensive quantitative model of the potential impacts of SLR on wildlife habitat. The first chapter (chapter 1) describes the vegetation and topography of 20 islands of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, the distribution and status of wildlife populations, and the predicted impacts for a range of SLR scenarios. Furthermore, this chapter explores the potential effects of SLR on wildlife breeding habitats for each island. The subsequent chapter (chapter 2) details a study of the Laysan Island ecosystem, describing a quantitative model that incorporates SLR, storm wave, and rising groundwater inundation. Wildlife, storm, and oceanographic data allowed for an assessment of the phenological and spatial vulnerability of Laysan Island's breeding bird species to SLR and storms. Using remote sensing and geospatial techniques, we estimated topography, classified vegetation, modeled SLR, and evaluated a range of climate change scenarios. On the basis of high-resolution airborne data collected during 2010-11 (root-mean-squared error = 0.05-0.18 m), we estimated the maximum elevation of 20 individual islands extending from Kure Atoll to French Frigate Shoals (range: 1.8-39.7 m) and computed the mean elevation (1.7 m, standard deviation 1.1 m) across all low-lying islands. We also analyzed general climate models to describe rainfall and temperature scenarios expected to influence adaptation of some plants and animals for this region. Outcomes for the NWHI predicted an increase in temperature of 1.8-2.6 degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) and an annual decrease in precipitation of 24.7-76.3 millimeters (mm) across the NWHI by 2100. Our models of passive SLR (excluding wave-driven effects, erosion, and accretion) showed that approximately 4 percent of the total land area in the NWHI will be lost with scenarios of +1.0 m of SLR and 26 percent will be lost with +2.0 m of SLR. Some atolls are especially vulnerable to SLR. For example, at Pearl and Hermes Atoll our analysis indicated substantial habitat losses with 43 percent of the land area inundated at +1.0 m SLR and 92 percent inundated at +2.0 m SLR. Across the NWHI, seven islands will be completely submerged with +2.0 m SLR. The limited global ranges of some tropical nesting birds make them particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts in the NWHI. Climate change scenarios and potential SLR impacts presented here emphasize the need for early climate change adaptation and mitigation planning, especially for species with limited breeding distributions and\/or ranges restricted primarily to the low-lying NWHI: <i>Cyperus pennatiformis<\/i> var. <i>bryanii<\/i>, Black-footed Albatross (<i>Phoebastria nigripes<\/i>), Laysan Albatross (<i>P. immutabilis<\/i>), Bonin Petrel (<i>Pterodroma hypoleuca<\/i>), Gray-backed Tern (<i>Onychoprion lunatus<\/i>), Laysan Teal (<i>Anas laysanensis<\/i>), Laysan Finch (<i>Telespiza cantans<\/i>), and Hawaiian monk seal (<i>Monachus schauinslandi<\/i>). Furthermore, SLR scenarios that include the effects of wave dynamics and groundwater rise may indicate amplified vulnerability to climate change driven habitat loss on low-lying islands. In chapter 2, we incorporated the combined effects of SLR, dynamic wave-driven inundation, and rising groundwater in a quantitative study specifically for the Laysan Island ecosystem. This is the first hydrodynamic model to simulate the combined impacts of SLR and wave-driven inundation in the NWHI. We developed a high-resolution digital elevation model (mean vertical accuracy of 0.32 m) for the island. Then using recent satellite imagery, geospatial models, and historical oceanographic, storm, and biological data we estimated potential inundation extent, habitat loss, and wildlife population impacts for a range of potential SLR scenarios (0.00, +0.50, +1.00, +1.50, and +2.00 m) that may occur over the next century. Additionally, we estimated the carrying capacity of Laysan Island for five species based on the available population monitoring data and described how potential losses in nesting habitat could influence population dynamics for Black-footed Albatross, Laysan Albatross, Red-footed Booby (Sula sula), Laysan Teal, and Laysan Finch. For some other seabird populations (Masked Booby, <i>S. dactylatra<\/i>; Brown Booby, <i>S. leucogaster<\/i>; Great Frigatebird, <i>Fregata minor<\/i>; and Sooty Tern, <i>Onychoprion fuscata<\/i>), we used recent colony distribution data, land cover maps, and nesting behavior to estimate potential losses of nesting habitat from SLR and wave-driven inundation. We observed far greater potential impacts of SLR to wildlife with the dynamic wave-driven modeling approach than with the passive modeling approach. Depending on SLR scenario and coastal orientation, during storms under a +2.00 m SLR scenario, the wave-driven inundation model predicted three times more inundation than the passive model (17.2 percent of total terrestrial area versus 4.6 percent, respectively). Large-wave events generally added 1 m of water height to passive inundation surfaces, therefore our dynamic models (during storm events) forecasted comparable inundation extents earlier than passive models. Although wave-driven water levels were highest in the northwest quadrant of Laysan Island, the greatest extent of inundation occurred in the southeast where coastal dunes less than 3 m above mean sea level provide little protection from wave-driven inundation. When wave-driven inundation was included in the SLR model for Laysan Island greater nesting habitat loss and potential impacts on wildlife population dynamics were predicted. The consequences of habitat loss due to SLR may be worse for species with colonies in the wave-exposed coastal zones (for example, Black-footed Albatross) and for populations already near the island's carrying capacity (for example, Laysan Teal). Species whose peak incubation and chick-rearing periods coincide with seasonally high wave heights also will be increasingly vulnerable, especially those species nesting on the ground in areas vulnerable to inundation, such as Gray-backed Tern and Black-footed Albatross. Other species that have space for population growth, or are not restricted to a narrow range of habitat types on Laysan (for instance, Sooty Terns), may be less sensitive to habitat loss from SLR over the next century. Our assessments of inundation risk, habitat loss, and wildlife species vulnerability synthesize current knowledge about individual islands and contribute to a broader understanding of the impacts of inundation from SLR and storm-induced waves. Yet, most NWHI and their bird populations lack monitoring data to evaluate adaptations to and impacts of climate change. Exceptions include some data sets from long-term monitoring of wildlife populations, tides, or weather at French Frigate Shoals, Laysan Island, and Midway Atoll. These data sets are potentially valuable baselines, which could be informative for adaptive learning (integrating management and science) to predict, adapt, and mitigate the effects of climate change on NWHI wildlife in the future. This study provides the first quantitative vulnerability assessment for all of the low-lying NWHI, and results identify biological communities, locales, and resident endangered species of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument expected to be at risk from SLR. This report is also intended as a reference for managers and conservation planners, a tool to identify and potentially reduce uncertainty, and a starting place for developing climate change monitoring priorities and future scientific studies.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5074818fe4b090654e7b292e"],"contacts":[{"name":"Michelle H.

The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) is a group of islands of great conservation importance that is threatened by sea-level rise. Stretching 2,000 km beyond the main Hawaiian Islands, the NWHI are a World Heritage Site and part of the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument. The islands support the largest tropical seabird rookery in the world, providing breeding habitat for 21 species of seabirds, 4 land bird species, and essential habitat for other resident and migratory wildlife.

Researchers used high-resolution topographic and vegetation models to predict the impacts of a range of sea-level rise scenarios on 20 islands. Results showed that a sea-level rise of +1 m would result in the loss of 4% of the total land area in the NWHI, while a rise of +2 m would result in the loss of 26% of the total land area and could leave 7 islands completely submerged. Researchers then explored the potential implications of sea-level rise for wildlife breeding habitats on each island. A loss of 4% of land area could leave more than 200,000 seabirds without nesting habitat. Species with limited distributions are especially vulnerable, such as the Laysan Finch, Black-footed Albatross, Laysan Albatross, and Hawaiian monk seal.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nUnderstanding the vulnerability of these islands and their wildlife to sea-level rise will help managers determine the best course of action for helping these species persist in the face of climate change.<br>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n","purpose":"Scenarios of projected global climate change predict that sea level rise may inundate coastal and low elevation Pacific islands. The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands include 300,000 square kilometers of ocean waters and 10 sub-tropical islands and atolls of high conservation value. Designated as Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument, the islands provide habitat for the largest and most important assemblages of tropical seabirds in the world, with 14 million birds (22 species) and 11 endangered species of terrestrial birds and plants. Existing models of projected terrestrial habitat loss vary greatly between islands, but even small increases in sea level may result in loss of critical habitat and increase risk of extinctions of species restricted to low lying atolls. Thus, current conservation strategies to address climate change are based primarily on building interconnected systems of corridors and reserves. These strategies may be inadequate for many island species that are entirely blocked from shifting their geographic ranges by anthropogenic barriers to dispersal, such as loss of habitat, urbanization, introduced predators (absent from the remote low lying islands), or by behavioral and geographic constraints on dispersal. These island ecosystems require downsized spatial and temporal models to identify, assess, and manage risks to unique biological resources. By identifying areas and species most vulnerable, resource managers can plan for management scenarios such restorations or as the intentional transport of species to prevent species extinction (i.e. \u201cassisted migration\u201d or translocation). This project sought to elucidate uncertainty for land managers, using coastal topographic models of sea level change, and wildlife population carrying capacity and persistence estimates to provide the information needed to rank species vulnerability and better manage biological resources, given the modern pace of climate change and the need for multidimensional decision making. Integrated temporal and spatially explicit models are needed to assess vulnerability of select Hawaiian seabirds, endangered species, and their habitats of the low lying atolls.

Models were constructed using 2779 surveys collected from 541 Wisconsin lakes between 1989 and 2013 and predictor variables related to lake morphometry, thermal habitat, land use, and fishing pressure. We selected predictors to minimize collinearity while maximizing classification accuracy and data availability. The final model classified recruitment success based on lake surface area, water temperature degree-days, shoreline development factor, and conductivity. On average, recruitment was most likely in lakes larger than 225 ha. Low degree-days also increased the probability of successful recruitment, but primarily in lakes smaller than 150 ha. We forecasted the probability of walleye recruitment in 343 lakes considered for walleye stocking; lakes with high probability of natural reproduction but recent history of recruitment failure were prioritized for restoration stocking. Our results highlight the utility of models designed to predict recruitment for guiding management decisions, provided models are validated appropriately.","parentId":"54987053e4b07df8de5489d3","contacts":[{"name":"Gretchen J.A.

One promising approach to developing scientific information that can be easily and readily applied to management and policy decisions is to have scientists and decision makers work together to produce information.

We will then compare the outcomes and impacts of that project with other drought research that integrates decision-maker input in less intensive ways. We will compare and contrast the processes, outcomes, and decision-making impacts of each project to determine whether one approach holds more promise in producing actionable science than others.

However, we lack sufficient information about specific practices, strategies and actions that are most effective and efficient in promoting co-production of climate science knowledge and\/or producing actionable climate science knowledge.  We propose to conduct quasi-experimental research in which we compare the processes, outcomes, and impacts of a deliberately co-produced drought\/climate research project with other drought\/climate projects using varying approaches to stakeholder engagement.  We will use social science and evaluation research methods such as ethnographic document analysis, interviews, and participant observation to facilitate the co-production of one project and assess the process, outcomes, and impacts of comparable control projects.  Results from this project will be relevant to investigators and leaders within the CSC network and other organizations seeking to produce usable climate science.  Results will be shared via webinars, user-friendly summaries, and in small-group workshops to provide network members with a variety of choices for interacting with and exploring the findings.

At Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin, USA, data from a compulsory creel census (1965\u20132009) were combined with survey data on fish populations to test for empirical relationships between annual production and exploitation rates of walleye ( \n<em>Sander vitreus<\/em>). Empirical estimates of walleye production were relatively high and temporally variable in Escanaba Lake. Annual production, biomass, and&nbsp; \n<em>P<\/em>\/ \n<em>B<\/em>&nbsp;ratios ranges were 2.4\u201311.3 kg&middot;ha \n<sup>\u22121<\/sup>&middot;year \n<sup>\u22121<\/sup>, 9.1\u201349.4 kg&middot;ha \n<sup>\u22121<\/sup>, and 0.15\u20130.30 year \n<sup>\u22121<\/sup>, respectively. Walleye production rates were significantly and positively correlated with adult (i.e., age 3+) walleye density \u2014 the core metric used to manage walleye populations in the Ceded Territory of Wisconsin. However, adult walleye density correlated best with ages 4\u20136 production. Annual exploitation based on the percentage of individuals removed from the population was linearly related to annual exploitation based on the percentage of production removed. On average, 100% of annual production was harvested at \u223c20% annual exploitation of individuals; thus, higher sustained exploitation rates would deplete walleye biomass in Escanaba Lake over time. A sustainable annual exploitation rate of 20% annually is lower than the 35% limit reference point currently used for walleye management in the Ceded Territory of Wisconsin. Nevertheless, our estimate is strongly concordant with two recent and independent modeling efforts addressing this same topic. We suggest empirical estimates of fish production are a vastly underutilized tool for better understanding sustainable exploitation rates in walleye populations and, likely, fisheries in general.","parentId":"54987053e4b07df8de5489d3","contacts":[{"name":"Andrew L.

on Aquatic Habitats in the Midwestern United States (Regional Assessment)","body":"<p>The overall goal of the Midwestern regional-scale assessment was to identify river reaches in the Glacial Lakes Partnership regions (focusing on Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) that are most vulnerable to potential impacts of projected climate and land use changes. Because fish assemblages are strongly influenced by river water temperature and flow regimes, which are in turn affected by climate and land-use conditions, we will attempt to model fish habitat&nbsp;response to climate and land use changes through changes in temperature and flow. This project intended to: (1)&nbsp;develop three models that predict daily summer temperature for all river reaches in each state; (2)&nbsp;develop a single model to predict non-winter flow regimes for all river reaches in the region; (3)&nbsp;develop relational models among fish, water temperature regime, and flow regime; and (4)&nbsp;develop fish habitat scores that allow us to compare the fish assemblages, water temperature, and flow regimes under current and future climate and land-use conditions.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"5050cc14e4b0be20bb30eac8","contacts":[{"name":"Lizhu

on Aquatic Habitats of the Lower Colorado River Basin (Regional Assessment)","body":"<p>Previous climate change research for the Colorado River Basin has used down-scaled climate models to predict impacts to hydropower and the potential ability to meet mandated water releases. The Lower Colorado River Basin (LCRB) has one of the most imperiled fish faunas in the nation with about half of the native fish species listed as Threatened or Endangered under the Federal Endangered Species Act. Current water demands for agriculture and human consumption are only slightly less than long-term annual flows. Future projections based on climate change alone indicate decreased precipitation, increased temperatures, and lower annual runoff which will further stress this ecosystem that is experiencing among the highest human population growth rates in the nation. We refined the national fish habitat assessment using finer scale climate and land use change models combined with region-specific threats to predict impacts to aquatic habitats and the resulting responses of native and non-native fish communities in the LCRB. The goal of this project is to (1)&nbsp;project potential changes in the quality of aquatic habitat resulting from change in climate and land use, and (2)&nbsp;examine potential effects of projected climate and land use change on assemblage structure of fish communities.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"5050cc14e4b0be20bb30eac8","contacts":[{"name":"Joanna Whittier","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"whittierj@missouri.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Missouri"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Craig Paukert","oldPartyId":7910,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"cpaukert@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Unit Leader Research Fish Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Paukert","organization":{"displayText":"Missouri Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"5738845070","officePhone":"5738823524","streetAddress":{"zip":"65211","city":"Columbia","state":"MO","line1":"302 ANHEUSERBUSCH NATURAL RES BLDG, University of MO"},"buildingCode":"KRH","name":"Craig Paukert\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

From a management perspective, the SMB is important both as a popular sport fish and as a threat to native species where it is present outside of its natural range. Understanding the population-level responses of this species to environmental change is thus a priority for fisheries resource managers. This project aimed to explicitly model the impacts of projected climate and land use change on the growth, population dynamics, and distribution of stream-dwelling SMB in the U.S. Impacts on growth and demographic variables were modeled using data from multiple populations across the SMB native range in order to examine and account for intraspecific differences and local adaptation.&nbsp;The specific goals of this project were to (1) estimate&nbsp;changes in thermal habitat due to predicted climate change for four stream-dwelling SMB populations, and (2) project&nbsp;changes in somatic growth and prey consumption for the focal SMB populations based on bioenergetics simulations and predicted stream temperature changes.&nbsp;By examining mechanistically the population-level impacts of projected climate and land use change and incorporating them into models of potential changes in distribution, we built upon previous efforts and provide valuable information for the conservation and management of SMB in the U.S.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p><br> &nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"5050cc14e4b0be20bb30eac8","contacts":[{"name":"Craig Paukert","oldPartyId":7910,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"cpaukert@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Unit Leader Research Fish Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Paukert","organization":{"displayText":"Missouri Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"5738845070","officePhone":"5738823524","streetAddress":{"zip":"65211","city":"Columbia","state":"MO","line1":"302 ANHEUSERBUSCH NATURAL RES BLDG, University of MO"},"buildingCode":"KRH","name":"Craig Paukert\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

The effects of climate change may be particularly large in mountainous regions where climate can vary significantly with elevation. Understanding potential future vegetation changes in these regions requires methods that can resolve vegetation responses to climate change at fine spatial resolutions. We used LPJ, a dynamic global vegetation model, to assess potential future vegetation changes for a large topographically complex area of the northwest United States and southwest Canada (38.0\u201358.0&deg;N latitude by 136.6\u2013103.0&deg;W longitude). LPJ is a process-based vegetation model that mechanistically simulates the effect of changing climate and atmospheric CO2&nbsp;concentrations on vegetation. It was developed and has been mostly applied at spatial resolutions of 10-minutes or coarser. In this study, we used LPJ at a 30-second (~1-km) spatial resolution to simulate potential vegetation changes for 2070\u20132099. LPJ was run using downscaled future climate simulations from five coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (CCSM3, CGCM3.1(T47), GISS-ER, MIROC3.2(medres), UKMO-HadCM3) produced using the A2 greenhouse gases emissions scenario. Under projected future climate and atmospheric CO2&nbsp;concentrations, the simulated vegetation changes result in the contraction of alpine, shrub-steppe, and xeric shrub vegetation across the study area and the expansion of woodland and forest vegetation. Large areas of maritime cool forest and cold forest are simulated to persist under projected future conditions. The fine spatial-scale vegetation simulations resolve patterns of vegetation change that are not visible at coarser resolutions and these fine-scale patterns are particularly important for understanding potential future vegetation changes in topographically complex areas.","parentId":"50746746e4b090654e7b27a4","contacts":[{"name":"Sarah L Shafer","oldPartyId":56505,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.","firstName":"Sarah","middleName":"L","lastName":"Shafer","organization":{"displayText":"USGS"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Patrick J.

Recent declining walleye and increasing largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and management actions for these species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake-specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, US, under contemporary (1989\u20132014) and future (2040\u20132064 and 2065\u20132089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake-specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 33\u201375% of lakes where recruitment is currently supported and a 27\u201360% increase in the number of lakes suitable for high largemouth bass abundance. The percentage of lakes capable of supporting abundant largemouth bass but failed walleye recruitment was predicted to increase from 58% in contemporary conditions to 86% by mid-century and to 91% of lakes by late century, based on median projections across GCMs. Conversely, the percentage of lakes with successful walleye recruitment and low largemouth bass abundance was predicted to decline from 9% of lakes in contemporary conditions to only 1% of lakes in both future periods. Importantly, we identify up to 85 resilient lakes predicted to continue to support natural walleye recruitment. Management resources could target preserving these resilient walleye populations.","parentId":"5519b6b8e4b032384278331f","linkParentIds":["54987053e4b07df8de5489d3"],"contacts":[{"name":"Gretchen Hansen","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"gretchen.hansen@state.mn.us","organization":{"displayText":"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jordan S Read","oldPartyId":60525,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"jread@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Civil Engineer","firstName":"Jordan","middleName":"S","lastName":"Read","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey, Office of Water Information"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"6088213817","officePhone":"6088213922","streetAddress":{"zip":"53562","city":"Middleton","state":"WI","line1":"8505 Research Way"},"buildingCode":"ARM","name":"Jordan S Read\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"53562-3581","country":"USA","city":"Middleton","state":"WI","line1":"8505 Research Way"},"building":"8505 Research Way"}},{"name":"Jonathan F.

The purpose of this assessment was to determine the impacts that projected future land use and climate changes might have on the condition of stream habitat to support self-sustaining brook trout populations. The study region encompassed the historic native range of brook trout, which includes the northeastern states and follows the Appalachian Mountains south to Georgia, where the distribution is limited to higher elevation streams with suitable water temperatures. Relationships between recent observations of brook trout and predicted stream temperature, land use, and a number of potential habitat stressors were used to make predictions regarding the condition of the habitat in each stream reach for supporting self-sustaining brook trout populations now and under future climate and land use change scenarios. The objectives of this project were to (1) develop a stream temperature model and predict water temperature for all stream reaches in the Eastern Brook Trout Joint Venture (EBTJV) region under present conditions and future scenarios of climate and land use change; (2) predict&nbsp;the occurrence of brook trout in all stream reaches of the EBTJV region based on relationships with natural landscape predictors, predicted stream temperature, and land use under present conditions and future scenarios of climate and land use change; and (3) provide maps and characteristics of stream reaches where stream temperatures and suitability for brook trout are predicted to change under climate and land use change scenarios. Further, to help meet local and regional management needs, researchers aimed to (1) identify thresholds of land use that might preclude self-sustaining brook trout populations at a regional scale; (2) identify management practices that might help mitigate climate change impacts at a regional scale, and (3) use&nbsp;case studies to discuss properties associated with vulnerability in the region.<br>

Effects on Birds and Reptiles of the Southwestern United States","body":"<ul> \n <li>We modeled the current and future breeding ranges of seven bird and five reptile species in the Southwestern United States with sets of landscape, biotic (plant), and climatic global circulation model (GCM) variables.<\/li> \n <li>For modeling purposes, we used PRISM data to characterize the climate of the Western United States between 1980 and 2009 (baseline for birds) and between 1940 and 2009 (baseline for reptiles). In contrast, we used a pre-selected set of GCMs that are known to be good predictors of southwestern climate (five individual and one ensemble GCM), for the A1B emission scenario, to characterize future climatic conditions in three time periods (2010\u201339; 2040\u201369; and, 2070\u201399).<\/li> \n <li>Our modeling approach relied on conceptual models for each target species to inform selection of candidate explanatory variables and to interpret the ecological meaning of developed probabilistic distribution models. We employed logistic regression and maximum entropy modeling techniques to create a set of probabilistic models for each target species.<\/li> \n <li>We considered climatic, landscape, and plant variables when developing and testing our probabilistic models. Climatic variables included the maximum and minimum mean monthly and seasonal temperature and precipitation for three time periods. Landscape features included terrain ruggedness and insolation. We also considered plant species distributions as candidate explanatory variables where prior ecological knowledge implicated a strong association between a plant and animal species.<\/li> \n <li>Projected changes in range varied widely among species, from major losses to major gains.<\/li> \n <li>Breeding bird ranges exhibited greater expansions and contractions than did reptile species.<\/li> \n <li>We project range losses for Williamson\u2019s sapsucker and pygmy nuthatch of a magnitude that could move these two species close to extinction within the next century. Although both species currently have a relatively limited distribution, they can be locally common, and neither are presently considered candidates for prospective endangerment.<\/li> \n <li>We project range losses of over 40 percent, from its current extent of occurrence, for the plateau striped whiptail, Arizona black rattlesnake, and common lesser earless lizard. Currently, these reptile species are thought to be common or at least locally abundant throughout their ranges.<\/li> \n <li>The total contribution of plants in each distribution model was very small, but models that contained at least one plant always outperformed models with only physical variables (climatic or landscape). The magnitude of change in projected range increased further into the future, especially when a plant was in the model.<\/li> \n <li>Among bird species, those that had the strongest association with a landscape feature during the breeding season, such as terrain ruggedness and insolation, exhibited the smallest contractions in projected breeding range in the future. In contrast, bird species that had weak associations with landscape features, but strong climatic associations, suffered the greatest breeding range contractions. Thus, landscape effects appeared to buffer some of the negative effects of climate change for some species.<\/li> \n <li>Among bird species, magnitude of change in projected breeding range was positively related to the annual average temperature of their baseline distribution, thus species with the warmest breeding ranges exhibited the greatest changes in future breeding ranges. This pattern was not evident for reptiles, but might exist if additional species were included in the model.<\/li> \n <li>Our results provide managers with a series of projected range maps that will enable scientists, concerned citizens, and wildlife managers to identify what the potential effects of climate change will be on bird and reptile distributions in the Western United States. We hope that our results can be used in proactive ways to mitigate some of the potential effects of climate change on selected species.<\/li> \n<\/ul>","parentId":"50746872e4b090654e7b27db","contacts":[{"name":"Charles van Riper III","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Southwest Biological Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"James R.

Herein, we predict the effects of future climate and land use change on cold-water fish habitat in the glacial lakes of the upper midwestern US. Ecoregion-specific, regional regression models were developed to predict annual phosphorus loading rates to lakes based on land use and hydrology and coupled to a previously developed fish habitat model. Outputs from one land use change model and three global climate models were then used to project future cold-water habitat. Significant decreases in cold-water habitat quality were projected in all four ecoregions of the study region, with increases in air temperature generally having greater impacts on habitat than land use changes. Projected localized increases in urbanization and corn acreage were found to degrade cold-water habitat for a subset of lakes in all ecoregions. For cisco (Coregonus artedi), the most thermally tolerant of the four species considered, it was found that most of the highest quality (tier 1) refuge lakes will shift to lower quality (tier 2) lakes with adequate habitat, and about half of the tier 2 lakes will shift to tier 3 (non-refuge) lakes with marginal habitat.","materialRequestInstructions":"For access to this publication, please contact the publication authors.&nbsp;","parentId":"50a6559fe4b0d446a665cadd","contacts":[{"name":"William R.

Not least among those uncertainties are questions regarding future climate conditions. Technological advancements have enhanced our ability to understand and model climate, which has led to improved climate forecasting capabilities. However, climate projections are usually produced at a global scale, which makes them impractical for natural resource managers who are concerned with how climate will change in the specific location or region in which they operate. While there have been a growing number of techniques for increasing the resolution of these projections, resource managers are given little guidance on how to choose the best method or model to meet their needs.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThis project will provide managers with much needed guidance on how to navigate the range of available modeling methods, and to identify situations in which these climate models will be most useful. For example, managers could invest in improving modeling techniques to achieve a more specific understanding of future climate conditions, but this investment may not yield the desired results, and resources may be better spent elsewhere. This project will help natural resource managers understand the types of information that can plausibly be gained from climate projections, how to use climate models to inform management decisions, and how to best utilize available climate information to meet their needs while coping with uncertainty.<\/div>\n","purpose":"Natural resource managers face uncertainties of many kinds, with limited budgets and ever-evolving hierarchies of management priorities. Not least among those uncertainties are questions regarding future climate conditions. With the advent of high speed computers and a better understanding of the climate system, numerical modeling of atmospheric and oceanic circulations has allowed climate forecasting and climate change projections to become increasingly skillful. However, there remain limits to the information that can be provided and often decreasing returns to effort to increase that information. Natural resource managers at the USGS could elect to invest time and money in deeper study of climate dynamics in order to narrow the range of future climate conditions for which they are making plans, but the invested time and money may yield few useful insights. For natural resource managers, then, it would be very helpful to identify conditions under which continued climate science investigation may be fruitful, and where it may not represent the best use of effort. The objective of this effort is to provide clear guidance for natural resource decision making under climate uncertainty, including appropriate expectations for climate information and best practices for decision making.","parentId":"5703c926e4b0328dcb822b49","contacts":[{"name":"Casey Brown","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"casey@engin.umass.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"(413) 577-2337","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"01003","country":"USA","city":"Amerst","state":"Massachusetts","line1":"12B Marston Hall College of Engineering Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of Massachusetts Amherst 130 Natural Resources Road"}}},{"name":"Patrick Ray","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"paray@umass.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"4133455521","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"01003","country":"United States","city":"Amherst","state":"Massachusetts","line1":"18 Marston Hall"}}},{"name":"NCCWSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"NCCWSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2016"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"climate change"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"natural resource management"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"strategic planning"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"downscaling"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"decision scaling"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"decision tree"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2016","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-10-14T09:11:28.290-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-28T10:31:48.052-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Technical Summary","value":"The Earth\u2019s climate is a highly complex and nonlinear system, and it is difficult to fully understand and simulate how climate is changing in space and time.

of Quaking Aspen Woodlands and Associated Bird Communities to Global Climate Change in the Northern Great Basin","body":"<p>Quaking aspen populations are declining in much of the West due to altered fire regimes, competition&nbsp;with conifers, herbivory, drought, disease, and insect outbreaks. Aspen stands typically support higher bird&nbsp;biodiversity and abundance than surrounding habitat types, and maintaining current distribution and abundance&nbsp;of several bird species in the northern Great Basin is likely tied to the persistence of aspen in the landscape.&nbsp;This project examined the effects of climate change on aspen and associated bird communities by coupling&nbsp;empirical models of avian-habitat relationships with landscape simulations of vegetation community and&nbsp;disturbance dynamics under various climate change scenarios. Field data on avian abundance, stand age&nbsp;structure, and other vegetation characteristics will be combined with existing spatial data sets. Key questions&nbsp;that were examined include: (1) what is the current successional, structural, and spatial distribution of aspen&nbsp;on the landscape, and how do these factors affect abundance of bird species; (2) how have aspen stand condition&nbsp;and distribution, and avian abundance and distribution, been shaped by disturbance&nbsp;(e.g., grazing and fire); (3)&nbsp;how is global climate change likely to affect aspen condition and distribution, and what are the implications for&nbsp;avian species; and (4) how are today\u2019s management strategies, or adaptive adjustments to those strategies, likely&nbsp;to affect long-term risks and persistence of aspen and associated avian communities.<\/p>","parentId":"5050cc14e4b0be20bb30eac8","contacts":[{"name":"Susan L Earnst","oldPartyId":2809,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"susan_earnst@usgs.gov","jobTitle":"Research Wildlife Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Susan","middleName":"L","lastName":"Earnst","organization":{"displayText":"Snake River Field Station, FRESC"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"2084265210","officePhone":"2084265209","streetAddress":{"zip":"83706","city":"Boise","state":"ID","line1":"970 Lusk Street"},"buildingCode":"WID","name":"Susan L Earnst\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

\n <li> \n  <div> \n   <p>Lakes Michigan and Huron, which are undergoing oligotrophication after reduction of phosphorus loading, invasion by dreissenid mussels and variation in climate, provide an opportunity to conduct large-scale evaluation of the relative importance of these changes for lake productivity. We used remote sensing, field data and an information-theoretic approach to identify factors that showed statistical relationships with observed changes in chlorophyll a (chla) and primary production (PP).<\/p> \n  <\/div> <\/li> \n <li> \n  <div> \n   <p>Spring phosphorus (TP), annual mean chla and PP have all declined significantly in both lakes since the late 1990s. Additionally, monthly mean values of chla have decreased in many but not all months, indicating altered seasonal patterns. The most striking change has been the decrease in chla concentration during the spring bloom.<\/p> \n  <\/div> <\/li> \n <li> \n  <div> \n   <p>Mean chlorophyll a concentration was 17% higher in Lake Michigan than in Lake Huron, and total production for 2008 in Lake Michigan (9.5&nbsp;tg&nbsp;year\u22121) was 10% greater than in Lake Huron (7.8&nbsp;tg&nbsp;year\u22121), even though Lake Michigan is slightly smaller (by 3%) than Lake Huron. Differences between the lakes in the early 1970s evidently persisted to 2008.<\/p> \n  <\/div> <\/li> \n <li> \n  <div> \n   <p>Invasive mussels influenced temporal trends in spring chla and annual primary production. However, TP had a greater effect on chla and primary production than did the mussels, and TP varied independently from them. Two climatic variables (precipitation and air temperature in the basins) influenced annual chla and annual PP, while the extent of ice cover influenced TP but not chla or primary production.

In North America, they were first reported in Texas in the 1980s, and a marked range expansion occurred in 2001. Although there is concern about the influence of climate change on the future distribution of GA, factors responsible for past dispersals remain uncertain. To better understand the factors that influence toxic bloom dispersal in reservoirs, this study characterized reservoir water quality associated with toxic GA blooms since 2001, and examined trends in water quality during a 20-year period bracketing the 2001 expansion. Archived data were analyzed for six impacted and six nonimpacted reservoirs from two major Texas basins: Brazos River and Colorado River. Data were simplified for analysis by pooling spatially (across sampling stations) and temporally (winter, December\u2013February) within reservoirs and generating depth-corrected (1 m) monthly values. Classification tree analysis [period of record (POR), 2001\u20132010] using salinity-associated variables (specific conductance, chloride, sulfate), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, temperature, total hardness, potassium, nitrate+nitrite, and total phosphorus indicated that salinity best predicts the toxic bloom occurrence. Minimum estimated salinities for toxic bloom formation were 0.59 and 1.02 psu in Brazos and Colorado River reservoirs, respectively. Principal component analysis (POR, 2001\u20132010) indicated that GA habitat is best defined by higher salinity relative to nonimpacted reservoirs, with winter DO and pH also being slightly higher and winter temperature slightly lower in impacted reservoirs. Trend analysis, however, did not reveal monotonic changes in winter water quality of GA-impacted reservoirs during the 20-year period (1991\u20132010) bracketing the 2001 dispersal. Therefore, whereas minimum levels of salinity are required for GA establishment and toxic blooms in Texas reservoirs, the lack of trends in water quality suggests that conditions favorable for toxic blooms pre-date the 2001 expansion. These observations are consistent with a climate change-independent scenario of past GA dispersals in Texas reservoirs driven by novel introductions into pre-existing favorable habitat. Reports of latent GA populations in certain nonimpacted reservoirs, however, provide a plausible scenario of future dispersals characterized by prolonged periods between colonization and toxic bloom development and driven by changes in water quality, natural, or anthropogenic.","parentId":"507480c2e4b090654e7b28f2","webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1568988313001984","title":"Pati\u00f1o et al., 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"dates":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-01-17T13:02:22.285-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2014-01-17T13:02:22.285-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Harmful Algae","parts":[{"type":"DOI Number","value":"10.1016\/j.hal.2013.12.006"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0"},"551ad0f3e4b03238427837b1":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"551ad0f3e4b03238427837b1","title":"River\u2019s End: Mapping Patterns of Stream Drying in the Western United States","body":"<div>\n  Water in the western United States is disappearing, and several states are facing severe water shortages as drought conditions worsen.

As the effects of drought now and potentially into the future under climate warming are realized, concern has grown about the possibility that many streams will simply dry up.  Stream drying or desiccation is likely to increase as stream flows across the west decline (Luce and Holden 2009; Luce et al. 2013).  Loss of surface flows poses serious threats to aquatic species, potentially leading to irreversible extinctions, loss of connectivity, and decreased habitat availability.  The prospect of complete water loss through stream desiccation is clearly a transformational consequence of drought.  Our overarching objective in this work is to develop new methods for identifying and quantifying patterns of stream desiccation, and to apply broad-scale statistical models to predict patterns of stream desiccation across broad extents within the western United States.  Through this process we will be able to identify the most important factors (including those tied to droughts such as snowpack, wildfire, warm temperatures) that drive stream desiccation, which in turn will prove valuable for a multitude of management decisions that depend on anticipating future patterns of drought as climate change is realized.\r\nThe first step in this effort is to develop new methods to identify where and when streams are drying.  To do this, our project will build from existing efforts to model and map stream temperatures across the western United States, and ultimately across the Nation.  This massive effort to acquire temperature data has been successful in modeling and mapping temperatures across the west (www.fs.fed.us\/rm\/boise), but these thousands of temperature records may also allow us to identify patterns of stream desiccation.  Typically when a temperature record is interrupted by stream desiccation, the data are discarded or filtered out (e.g., Dunham et al. 2005), but if we can unlock the signature of stream desiccation from these data (i.e., identifying when recordings are actually of air temperature, not water), then we are able to unlock thousands of records that can be used for modeling and mapping spatial and temporal variability in water availability in response to drought and other influences.  Although the prospect of obtaining information on stream desiccation from time series of temperatures represents a major opportunity, it is critical to develop valid, reliable procedures for this purpose.  To this end, we will utilize networks of stream temperature loggers paired with resistors, which measure the presence of water in streams (Blasch et al. 2002, Jaeger and Olden 2012).  We are in the process of deploying these networks in streams within the Great Basin desert and in National Parks extending from southern Oregon to southern California (>200 deployments beginning in FY 2014, with more planned in future FYs).  These datasets will allow us to determine exactly when streams desiccate and how recorded temperatures change when this occurs.  We will explore how to diagnose these changes in thermal regimes using a host of descriptors (Arismendi et al. 2013) applied at hourly to weekly time scales.  We expect the thermal signature of stream desiccation may vary according to local climatic and hydrologic conditions, and that in some locations stream desiccation will be easy to diagnose, whereas in others a greater suite of indicators may be necessary, or when local factors (e.g., water diversion, groundwater extraction) complicate prediction from readily obtainable spatial data.  \r\nUltimately, with patterns of stream desiccation established at locations (e.g., timing, duration, frequencies), we can develop models to predict patterns based on covariates linked to temporally and spatially variable climatic conditions (including factors that are magnified under droughts), spatial variation in fixed hydro-geologic factors, patterns of land use, or other relevant covariates (e.g., Wigington et al. 2012).  The main products from this project would include 1) protocols for deployment of temperature and resistance loggers for use by field personnel; 2) methods for extracting information on stream desiccation from time series of temperature data in streams; 3) models to allow us to understand factors that influence stream desiccation and to predict patterns across broad extents and under different climatic (e.g., drought) or other scenarios, 4) fully documented database in compliance with the NCCWSC and USGS policies, 5) outreach through webinars, publications, and most importantly through direct engagement with practitioners who need products from this work.\r\n"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Type","value":"COA"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Number","value":"CM3870"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":146320,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":146320}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":3998,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":4277281,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-02-24T13:25:23.000Z","name":"NCCW-2015-9_UpperWhitehorseCreek_OR_JasonDunham1.JPG","pathOnDisk":"__disk__5a\/3f\/c8\/5a3fc8ce6b8413b1fb684ed320433a40a271f811","title":"Upper Whitehorse Creek, southeastern OR - Credit: Jason Dunham","contentType":"image\/jpeg","imageHeight":2998,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/551ad0f3e4b03238427837b1?f=__disk__5a%2F3f%2Fc8%2F5a3fc8ce6b8413b1fb684ed320433a40a271f811"},{"imageWidth":3998,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":5421694,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-02-24T13:25:25.000Z","name":"NCCW-2015-9_UpperWhitehorseCreek_OR_JasonDunham2.JPG","pathOnDisk":"__disk__38\/1a\/bf\/381abf216d03ba45c6000fedbe68bcc5661f58c6","title":"Upper Whitehorse Creek, southeastern OR - Credit: Jason Dunham","contentType":"image\/jpeg","imageHeight":2998,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/551ad0f3e4b03238427837b1?f=__disk__38%2F1a%2Fbf%2F381abf216d03ba45c6000fedbe68bcc5661f58c6"},{"imageWidth":3998,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":3589094,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2016-02-24T13:25:22.000Z","name":"NCCW-2015-9_UpperWhitehorseCreek_OR_JasonDunham3.JPG","pathOnDisk":"__disk__e8\/ed\/25\/e8ed257599bddcf28aa531e03d67703e874b409d","title":"Upper Whitehorse Creek, southeastern OR - Credit: Jason Dunham","contentType":"image\/jpeg","imageHeight":2998,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/551ad0f3e4b03238427837b1?f=__disk__e8%2Fed%2F25%2Fe8ed257599bddcf28aa531e03d67703e874b409d"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/551ad0f3e4b03238427837b1?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/551ad0f3e4b03238427837b1?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=551ad0f3e4b03238427837b1&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=551ad0f3e4b03238427837b1&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=551ad0f3e4b03238427837b1&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=551ad0f3e4b03238427837b1","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/551ad0f3e4b03238427837b1\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/551ad0f3e4b03238427837b1","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"River_sEnd_Mapp.zip","files":""}],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Jason Dunham","Daniel Isaak","Charlie Luce"],"orgs":["NCCWSC"],"funding_years":"2015","fy":"2015"},"573f4df1e4b04a3a6a24ae6b":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"573f4df1e4b04a3a6a24ae6b","title":"Safe Operating Space for Walleye: Managing Inland Recreational Fisheries for Climate Change","body":"<div>Walleye, a socially and economically important sportfish across much of North America, are experiencing population declines in many lakes throughout their range. Studies suggest that multiple factors \u2013 potentially linked to climate change \u2013 are contributing to the decline of walleye, including changes in lake temperatures, loss of habitat, increasing water clarity (perhaps due to drought), and interactions with other fish. This research seeks to identify the mechanisms that underlie declining walleye populations, particularly the low survival rate of young walleye. Data will be collected through a whole-lake experiment, an analysis of long-term data from lakes in northern Wisconsin, and simulation modeling. Members of the research team will work closely with fisheries managers. The goal of this project is to increase our understanding of the conditions that are needed to maintain self-sustaining walleye populations (their \u201csafe operating space\u201d) and to inform a new vision for recreational fisheries management in a changing climate.<\/div>\n","parentId":"5703c926e4b0328dcb822b49","contacts":[{"name":"Daniel Isermann","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"amusch@uwsp.edu","organization":{"displayText":"WI Cooperative Fishery Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"715-346-3221","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"54481","country":"USA","city":"Stevens Point","state":"WI","line1":"800 Reserve St"}}},{"name":"NCCWSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"walleye"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"wisconsin"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"NCCWSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2016"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2016-05-04","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2023-09-30","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-05-20T11:48:33.789-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-25T11:56:45.551-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Technical Summary","value":"Global change, including large scale changes in climate, land use, hydrology, and biogeochemistry, creates unprecedented pressure on inland recreational fisheries. Local fish managers have little influence on these large-scale changes, but they can manipulate factors such as harvest, food web structure, and some features of habitat. The Safe Operating Space (SOS) concept establishes a framework for analyzing a fishery in the context of both large-scale and local factors. Adaptation is the manipulation of local factors (such as harvest, food web structure, or habitat) to maintain the SOS of a fishery as the climate changes. At the scale of many lakes on a landscape, the SOS can be used to identify lakes that are inside, outside, or on the edge of the SOS. Appropriate management may differ among these three categories of lakes. A lake that lies on the edge of the SOS may be restored by management that moves it into the SOS. This project will develop the SOS concept using the Walleye fisheries of Northern Wisconsin as a test case. The research will use comparative studies, a whole-lake experiment, models, and synthesis of extant long-term data to quantify the Walleye SOS over a diverse landscape with thousands of lakes. We will develop tools for classifying lakes with respect to the Walleye SOS. For lakes on the edge of the SOS, we will use simulation models to explore options for tipping such lakes into the SOS. We will conduct a whole-lake experiment to test the feasibility of restoring the Walleye SOS by removal of centrarchids. Findings will be shared with the public, managers, and the scientific community through diverse media, publications, workshops and presentations. At the end of the project, we will synthesize the SOS concept for fisheries and evaluate its use as a framework for adapting fisheries to climate change."}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":250000,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2016","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":250000}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":1050,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-10-07T18:36:54.000Z","title":"Walleye -

Because of the ecological importance of SAV habitats, the US Environmental Protection Agency, US Geological Survey, and US Department of Agriculture partnered with Warren Pinnacle Consulting to enhance the SLAMM modeling software to include new functionality in order to predict changes in Zostera marina distribution within Pacific Northwest estuaries in response to sea level rise. The objective was to develop a SAV model that used generally available geographic information systems (GIS) data and parameters that were predictive and that could be customized for other estuaries that have GIS layers of existing SAV distribution. This report describes the procedure used to develop the SAV model for the Yaquina Bay Estuary, Oregon, appends a statistical script based on the open source R software to generate a similar SAV model for other estuaries that have data layers of existing SAV, and describes how to incorporate the model coefficients from the site\u2010specific SAV model into SLAMM to predict the effects of sea level rise on Zostera marina distributions. To demonstrate the applicability of the R tools, we utilize them to develop model coefficients for Willapa Bay, Washington using site\u2010specific SAV data. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;","parentId":"50748153e4b090654e7b291e","contacts":[{"name":"Henry Lee II","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Environmental Protection Agency"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Deborah A Reusser","oldPartyId":8542,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"dreusser@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Geographic Researcher","personalTitle":"Ms.","firstName":"Deborah","middleName":"A","lastName":"Reusser","organization":{"displayText":"Western Fisheries Research Center, U.S. Geological Survey"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"5418674049","officePhone":"5418674045","streetAddress":{"zip":"97365","country":"US","city":"Newport","state":"OR","line1":"2111 SE Marine Science Drive"},"buildingCode":"WOI","name":"Deborah A Reusser\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"97365","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"531","city":"Newport","state":"OR","line1":"2111 SE Marine Science Drive"}}},{"name":"Melanie R.

Seasonally important variables included measures of antecedent water input and storage in spring, switching to indicators of drought, input or use in summer, followed by antecedent moisture availability in autumn. In spite of similar climates, there was evidence the grazed grassland showed a response to drying conditions 1&nbsp;mo sooner than the ungrazed grassland. Lead times were generally short early in the growing season and antecedent window durations increased from 3&nbsp;mo early in the growing season to 1&nbsp;yr or more as the growing season progressed.

Regulations for many species and species complexes have been cyclical over time, illustrating the challenge of consistently managing fisheries. Our long-term retrospective analysis was effective at identifying new opportunities for improved fisheries management in Wisconsin (i.e., panfish management). We therefore encourage other big data retrospective approaches within and across regions to identify past successes and future opportunities in other fisheries management programs.","parentId":"54987053e4b07df8de5489d3","contacts":[{"name":"Andrew L.

Some species have apparently adapted to climate change but the ability of most species to adapt remains unknown. The life history strategies of migratory animals are dictated by seasonal factors, which makes these species particularly vulnerable to heterogeneous changes in climate and phenology. Here, we examine the phenology of migratory shorebirds, their habitats, and primary food resources, and we hypothesize how climate change may affect migrants through predicted changes in phenology. Daily abundance of shorebirds at stopover sites was correlated with local phenology and peaked immediately prior to peaks in invertebrate food resources. A close relationship between migrant and invertebrate phenology indicates that shorebirds may be vulnerable to changes in seasonality driven by climate change. It is possible that shifts in migrant and invertebrate phenology will be congruent in magnitude and direction, but because migration phenology is dependent on a suite of ecological factors, any response is likely to occur at a larger temporal scale and may lag behind the response of invertebrate food resources. The resulting lack of sufficient access to food at stopover habitats may cause migrants to extend migration and have cascading effects throughout their life cycle. If the heterogeneous nature of climate change results in uneven changes in phenology between migrants and their prey, it may threaten the long-term viability of migratory populations.","parentId":"50746778e4b090654e7b27af","contacts":[{"name":"Ryan J.

During spring 2013 and 2014, we assessed&nbsp;<em>Calidris&nbsp;<\/em>habitat use in the Rainwater Basin (RWB) and the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) at both local and landscape scales. Although anthropogenic change has altered the wetland landscape in both regions, the scope and scale of anthropogenic change is more pronounced in the RWB. Our results indicate that invertebrate abundance predicted occupancy, but not abundance, of&nbsp;<em>Calidris<\/em>&nbsp;shorebirds at wetlands in the RWB. Regionally, we find that habitat structure which predicts shorebird occupancy and abundance is similar in both regions, but wetlands in the PPR supported a higher abundance of&nbsp;<em>Calidris&nbsp;<\/em>shorebirds than wetlands in the RWB. Our results suggest that the overall availability of wetlands on the landscape limits shorebird abundance independent of individual wetland quality, thus management efforts should consider not only the structure and function of individual wetlands, but also entire networks of managed habitat across the landscape.<\/p> \n<p>We also tested for variance in abundance estimates within and among wetlands by employing both visual point and flush surveys. We find considerable variation in predicted relationships between shorebird abundance and habitat attributes depending on method, observer, and site; variance also increased with area and vegetative characteristics of wetlands. Our results draw attention to potential weaknesses associated with traditional shorebird sampling approaches, as it is unclear whether errors in detection or shifts in habitat use account for variation among surveys. We urge further examination of sources of error in shorebird surveys in order to establish meaningful patterns relevant for the management of wetland habitat and the conservation of migratory populations.<\/p>","parentId":"50746778e4b090654e7b27af","contacts":[{"name":"Caitlyn Gillespie","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"uri":"http:\/\/digitalcommons.unl.edu\/natresdiss\/109\/?utm_source=digitalcommons.unl.edu%2Fnatresdiss%2F109&utm_medium=PDF&utm_campaign=PDFCoverPages","title":"Gillespie 2015","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"migratory birds"},{"name":"shorebirds"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015-05","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-04-30T11:35:51.457-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-30T11:37:28.444-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"DigitalCommons@University of Nebraska - Lincoln","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Thesis Paper","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","people":["Caitlyn Gillespie"]},"54dd2c58e4b08de9379b373c":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/52b4603ee4b029a4958d603f","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Simulating 2,368 temperate lakes reveals weak coherence in stratification phenology","relatedTitle":"Climate Change and Resilience of Sport Fisheries in Lakes","id":"54dd2c58e4b08de9379b373c","relatedId":"52b4603ee4b029a4958d603f","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/54dd2c58e4b08de9379b373c","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Climate Change and Resilience of Sport Fisheries in Lakes","relatedTitle":"Simulating 2,368 temperate lakes reveals weak coherence in stratification phenology","id":"52b4603ee4b029a4958d603f","relatedId":"54dd2c58e4b08de9379b373c","annotation":null}]},"id":"54dd2c58e4b08de9379b373c","title":"Simulating 2,368 temperate lakes reveals weak coherence in stratification phenology","body":"<p>Changes in water temperatures resulting from climate warming can alter the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems. Lake-specific physical characteristics may play a role in mediating individual lake responses to climate. Past mechanistic studies of lake-climate interactions have simulated generic lake classes at large spatial scales or performed detailed analyses of small numbers of real lakes. Understanding the diversity of lake responses to climate change across landscapes requires a hybrid approach that couples site-specific lake characteristics with broad-scale environmental drivers. This study provides a substantial advancement in lake ecosystem modeling by combining open-source tools with freely available continental-scale data to mechanistically model daily temperatures for 2,368 Wisconsin lakes over three decades (1979-2011). The model accurately predicted observed surface layer temperatures (RMSE: 1.74\u00b0C) and the presence\/absence of stratification (81.1% agreement). Among-lake coherence was strong for surface temperatures and weak for the timing of stratification, suggesting individual lake characteristics mediate some - but not all - ecologically relevant lake responses to climate.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["54987053e4b07df8de5489d3"],"contacts":[{"name":"Jordan S.

Simulations of these effects were carried out using the Coupled Hydrosphere-Atmosphere Research Model (CHARM), driven by output from the Canadian General Circulation Model version 3 (CRCM3) for past and future time periods. This results in increased downward longwave radiation and near-surface air temperature. The air temperature increases during summer have strong spatial minima directly over the lakes that are limited to the lowest model layer and seem to be associated with frequent fog depicted by CHARM. Precipitation is also generally increased, with the most spatially coherent, and among the strongest, increases occurring in the near-shore lake effect zones during winter. Evapotranspiration is generally increased, although only weakly over land, but very strongly over the lakes during winter. Water temperatures are increased and the summer stratification pattern (warmer water overlying colder) is established earlier in the year. Ice cover is diminished and limited to shallow parts of the lakes.

The differing response of small versus large lakes is potentially a result of wind-sheltering reducing turbulent mixing magnitude in small lakes. These results demonstrate that small lakes respond differently to climate change than large lakes, suggesting that current predictions of impacts to lakes from climate change may require modification.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["54987053e4b07df8de5489d3"],"contacts":[{"name":"Luke A.

Recognizing the degree to which species respond to changing climates is therefore an area of increasing conservation concern as species that are unable to respond face increased risk of extinction. Here we examine spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the rate of climate change across western North America and discuss the potential for conditions to arise that may limit the ability of western migratory birds to adapt to changing climates. Based on 52&nbsp;years of climate data, we show that changes in temperature and precipitation differ significantly between spring migration habitats in the desert southwest and breeding habitats throughout western North America.

We assessed the relative influence of landscape spatial processes and local habitat characteristics on patterns in the distribution and abundance of spawning steelhead ( \n<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss<\/em>), a threatened salmonid fish, across ~15,000 stream km in the John Day River basin, Oregon, USA. We used hurdle regression and a multi-model information theoretic approach to identify the relative importance of covariates representing key aspects of the steelhead life cycle (e.g., site access, spawning habitat quality, juvenile survival) at two spatial scales: within 2-km long survey reaches (local sites) and ecological neighborhoods (5 km) surrounding the local sites. Based on Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion, models that included covariates describing ecological neighborhoods provided the best description of the distribution and abundance of steelhead spawning given the data. Among these covariates, our representation of offspring survival (growing-season-degree-days, &deg;C) had the strongest effect size (7x) relative to other predictors. Predictive performances of model-averaged composite and neighborhood-only models were better than a site-only model based on both occurrence (percentage of sites correctly classified = 0.80&plusmn;0.03 SD, 0.78&plusmn;0.02 vs. 0.62&plusmn;0.05, respectively) and counts (root mean square error = 3.37, 3.93 vs. 5.57, respectively). The importance of both temperature and stream flow for steelhead spawning suggest this species may be highly sensitive to impacts of land and water uses, and to projected climate impacts in the region and that landscape context, complementation, and connectivity will drive how this species responds to future environments.

Relevant ecological information is urgently needed to guide their management and conservation.<\/li>\n\t<li>We adopted a modelling approach, which is a novel application to freshwater mussels to enhance inference on rare species, by borrowing data among species in a hierarchical framework to conduct the most comprehensive occurrence analysis for freshwater mussels to date. We incorporated imperfect detection to more accurately examine effects of biotic and abiotic factors at multiple scales on the occurrence of 14 mussel species and the entire assemblage of the Tar River Basin of North Carolina, U.S.A.<\/li>\n\t<li>The single assemblage estimate of detection probability for all species was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.36\u20130.47) with no species- or site-specific detection effects identified. We empirically observed 15 mussel species in the basin but estimated total species richness at 21 (95% CI, 16\u201324) when accounting for imperfect detection.<\/li>\n\t<li>Mean occurrence probability among species ranged from 0.04 (95% CI, 0.01\u20130.16) for&nbsp;<em>Alasmidonta undulata,<\/em>&nbsp;an undescribed&nbsp;<em>Lampsilis<\/em>&nbsp;sp.<em>,<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Strophitus undulatus<\/em>&nbsp;to 0.67 (95% CI, 0.42\u20130.86) for&nbsp;<em>Elliptio icterina<\/em>. Median occurrence probability among sites was &lt;0.30 for all species with the exception of&nbsp;<em>E.&nbsp;icterina<\/em>. Site occurrence probability generally related to mussel conservation status, with reduced occurrence for endangered and threatened species.<\/li>\n\t<li>Catchment-scale abiotic variables (stream power, agricultural land use) and species traits (brood time, host specificity, tribe) influenced the occurrence of mussel assemblages more than reach- or microhabitat-scale features.<\/li>\n\t<li>Our findings reflect the complexity of mussel ecology and indicate that habitat restoration alone may not be adequate for mussel conservation. Catchment-scale management can benefit an entire assemblage, but species-specific strategies may be necessary for successful conservation. The hierarchical multispecies modelling approach revealed findings that could not be elucidated by other means, and the approach may be applied more broadly to other river basins and regions. Accurate measures of assemblage dynamics, such as occurrence and species richness, are required to create management plans for effective conservation.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","parentId":"50748105e4b090654e7b2905","contacts":[{"name":"Tamara J.

Habitat decisions have important implications to individual fitness as well as population dynamics and community structure. Resource limitation, predation, competition, and unfavorable abiotic conditions all have the potential to influence survival and future reproductive potential. Understanding how changes to ecosystem structure and function impact species and populations of conservation concern is essential for conservation delivery to be effective. Similar to many migratory species, shorebird populations are declining worldwide and declines may be related to the loss of important stopover habitat in the form of mid-continental wetlands.<\/p> \n<p>During 2010-2011, I examined how long-distance migratory shorebirds have responded to extensive, agriculturally-driven&nbsp;alterations to wetland habitats. I focused on a suite of ecological conditions that are expected to influence migrant fitness, including habitat preference, resource availability, and behavior. Additionally, because land use change is expected to act in conjunction with climate change to alter wetland habitats, I examined a number of phenologic variables and made predictions on how migrants might be affected in the future.<\/p> \n<p>Results showed that&nbsp;migrant shorebirds were more likely to use highly-altered, agricultural wetlands than wetlands embedded in native grasslands and did so in greater numbers. Preference for altered habitat was unexpected because these habitats had lower food availability, but preference may be explained by the role of mud flat as an influential cue, which would increase the attractiveness of agricultural wetlands. Such a scenario can be indicative of an ecological trap, where individuals prefer lower quality habitat. However, behavioral analysis indicates that migrants have adapted to using novel habitats through increased foraging efficiency. Despite their apparent adaptability to changing conditions, migrant shorebirds may be susceptible to further population decline as a result of changes in phenology brought about by climate change. Results showed that peak migration is correlated with the availability of food resources. Given that shorebirds already prefer habitat with lower resource availability, any changes to invertebrate or migration phenology that is not congruent in magnitude and direction to the other could affect migrant populations.<\/p>","parentId":"50746778e4b090654e7b27af","contacts":[{"name":"Ryan Stutzman","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Nebraska - Lincoln"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"NCCWSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/digitalcommons.unl.edu\/natresdiss\/61\/","title":"Stutzman 2012","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Bird Migration"},{"name":"Phenology"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2012-11-27","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-02-20T08:34:17.132-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-02-18T09:36:32.872-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Master's Thesis","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","people":["Ryan Stutzman"],"orgs":["NCCWSC"]},"4f4e4b32e4b07f02db6b423b":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/4f833a3fe4b0e84f608680b2","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Stopover ecology of a migratory ungulate","relatedTitle":"Quantifying the Influence of Climate Change on Rocky Mountain Ungulates","id":"4f4e4b32e4b07f02db6b423b","relatedId":"4f833a3fe4b0e84f608680b2","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/4f4e4b32e4b07f02db6b423b","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Quantifying the Influence of Climate Change on Rocky Mountain Ungulates","relatedTitle":"Stopover ecology of a migratory ungulate","id":"4f833a3fe4b0e84f608680b2","relatedId":"4f4e4b32e4b07f02db6b423b","annotation":null}]},"id":"4f4e4b32e4b07f02db6b423b","title":"Stopover ecology of a migratory ungulate","body":"<p><strong>1.<\/strong> Birds that migrate long distances use stopover sites to optimize fuel loads and complete migration as quickly as possible.

Forage quality of stopovers increased with elevation and distance from winter range. Mule deer use of stopovers corresponded with a narrow phenological range, such that deer occupied stopovers 44 days prior to peak green-up, when forage quality was presumed to be highest. Mule deer used one stopover for every 5\u22193 and 6\u22197 km travelled during spring and autumn migrations, respectively, and used the same stopovers in consecutive years. <strong>4.<\/strong> Study findings indicate that stopovers play a key role in the migration strategy of mule deer by allowing individuals to migrate in concert with plant phenology and maximize energy intake rather than speed.

One critical threat is thermal sensitivity, because global climate change and other anthropogenic activities contribute to increasing stream temperature and altered hydrologic flow that may be detrimental to freshwater mussels.<\/li> \n <li>We incorporated four benthic environmental components \u2013 temperature, sediment, water level (a surrogate for flow) and a vertical thermal gradient in the sediment column \u2013 in laboratory mesocosm experiments with juveniles of two species of freshwater mussels (<em>Lampsilis abrupta<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Lampsilis radiata<\/em>) and tested their effects on survival, burrowing behaviour and byssus production.<\/li> \n <li>Increasing temperature diminished burrowing behaviour significantly in both species (<em>P&nbsp;<\/em>&lt;<em>&nbsp;<\/em>0.01), and the dewatered treatment significantly reduced burrowing in&nbsp;<em>L.&nbsp;radiata<\/em>, compared with that in the watered treatment. Increasing temperature also significantly reduced byssus production in both species (<em>P&nbsp;<\/em>&lt;<em>&nbsp;<\/em>0.01). Median lethal temperatures (LT50) ranged from 29.9 to 35.6&nbsp;&deg;C. Mussels did not burrow beneath the top stratum of sediment (0\u20132.5&nbsp;cm) and thus did not use the available thermal refuge.<\/li> \n <li>Our findings suggest that rising stream water temperature and dewatering may directly impact freshwater mussel abundance by causing mortality and may have indirect impacts via sublethal effects. Reduced burrowing capacity may hamper ability to escape predation or unfavourably high or low flows, and decreased byssus production may inhibit attachment and dispersal capabilities in juveniles.<\/li> \n<\/ol>","parentId":"50748105e4b090654e7b2905","contacts":[{"name":"Jennifer M.

We updated biological inputs to account for recent changes in the food webs and used temperature inputs in response to regional climate observed in the baseline period (1964\u20131993) and projected in the future period (2043\u20132070).<\/span>Bioenergetics<span>&nbsp;simulations were run across multiple age-classes and across all four seasons in different scenarios of prey availability. Due to the increased capacity of prey consumption, future growth and consumption by these salmonines were projected to increase substantially when prey availability was not limited. When prey consumption remained constant, future growth of these salmonines was projected to decrease in most cases but increase in some cases where the increase in metabolic cost can be compensated by the decrease in waste (egestion and excretion) loss. Consumption by these salmonines was projected to increase the most during spring and fall when prey energy densities are relatively high. Such seasonality benefits their future growth through increasing annual gross energy intake. Our results indicated that lake trout and steelhead would be better adapted to the warming climate than Chinook salmon. To maintain baseline growth into the future, an increase of 10&nbsp;% in baseline prey consumption was required for Chinook salmon but considerably smaller increases, or no increases, in prey consumption were needed by lake trout and steelhead.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["507468aee4b090654e7b27e6"],"contacts":[{"name":"Yu-Chun Kao","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Charles P.

However, this does not mean the species is immune to the effects of drought. In fact, the fragmented and isolated distribution of the desert mountain ranges that they inhabit means that they can\u2019t follow distant rain storms without traversing broad valleys at significant risk to mortality.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> This study examines the effects of a 2002 drought on desert bighorn sheep in the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Arizona. Specifically, researchers are exploring how the drought may have affected habitat selection, behavior, and diet of the sheep. For example, when water is scarce, herbivores such as desert bighorn sheep will switch their diet to forage more on vegetation with greater water content\u2014the trade-off is that these plants often have a lower nutritional value.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> By identifying how desert bighorn sheep responded to a past drought, researchers hope to identify specific habitat conditions and vegetation that can be used by the species during future droughts, thus contributing to management plans that more effectively protect the long-term survival of the species. \n<\/div>","purpose":"Desert bighorn sheep are the epitome of the rugged desert mountain ranges in the southwestern U.S. While they are adapted to harsh, desert conditions, the fragmented and isolated distribution of the desert mountain ranges makes them particularly susceptible to climate change and drought. Unlike other desert ungulates (e.g., desert mule deer), they cannot simply adjust their distribution to take advantage of distant rain storms without crossing broad valleys at significant risk of mortality. In the long term, if the changing climate in the Southwest renders some currently occupied mountain ranges as uninhabitable, northward movements of desert bighorn populations tracking areas with suitable climatic conditions will likely require significant translocation efforts. \n\nProject researchers will assess the responses of desert bighorn sheep to the severe drought observed in 2002. The specific objectives are to investigate: 1) seasonal habitat selection patterns across widely differing climatic periods to determine if desert bighorn use certain habitat features and or behavioral mechanisms to cope with extreme drought; 2) changes in diet selection across climatic periods to determine which forage species are used a buffer resources to maintain populations during droughts; and 3) nutritional intake resulting from dietary shifts across climatic periods. These analyses provide a unique opportunity to assess multiple behavioral responses (e.g., forage selection, habitat selection) of desert bighorn sheep to severe drought through which we hope to identify habitat conditions and key forage species that might buffer desert bighorn populations during future droughts.

This subspecies appears to be more vulnerable to drought than more northern subspecies, because it occupies small and fragmented streams which are at greater risk of drying up during drought. Most notably, in 2002 drought in the Southwest resulted in the loss of 14 different Rio Grande cutthroat trout populations \u2013 about 10% of the total population.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nWhile it is known that drought is having an effect on Rio Grande cutthroat trout, the specific ways in which individuals and populations are affected by drought remains unclear. In light of worsening drought conditions in the Southwest, the need to identify the specific impacts of drought on the Rio Grande cutthroat trout is only increasing. This project is examining the effects of reduced stream flow and higher stream temperature on Rio Grande cutthroat trout to identify how factors such as the survival of individual fish and the growth rates of entire populations may be changing. Once these effects have been identified, researchers will model the long-term survival of the subspecies under predicted future drought conditions.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nAlthough the Rio Grande cutthroat trout is not at immediate risk of extinction according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, more than half of the remaining populations are considered to be in fair or poor condition. The results of this research will directly inform managers as to the vulnerability of this species to drought and which actions can be taken to increase the survival of Rio Grande cutthroat trout during drought. The results will also be valuable for managers working to protect other southwestern trout species under a changing climate, such as the Gila trout and the Apache trout.<\/div>\n","purpose":"Although Rio Grande cutthroat trout are not currently considered at immediate risk of extinction (recent 12-month finding by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined listing under the Endangered Species Act was not warranted; U.S. Federal Register 2014), climate perturbations such as increasing air temperatures and drought are expected to have significant impacts on the persistence of the subspecies. Increases in air temperature and decreases in precipitation will increase aridity across the subspecies\u2019 current range and increase the duration and severity of droughts.\n\nIn 2002, for example, drought conditions throughout the southwestern U.S. extirpated 14 Rio Grande cutthroat trout populations. Nearly ten years later (2011-2012), the southwest experienced the worst drought on record with \u2018exceptional\u2019 drought conditions lasting well over 350 days. These climate shifts will likely affect Rio Grande cutthroat trout differently than northern subspecies of cutthroat trout. This is primarily because this southern subspecies occupy small isolated habitat patches with low flow and frequent intermittency in comparison to northern subspecies (i.e., Yellowstone and westslope cutthroat trout) which occupy large river systems and lakes.\n\nOur research will characterize the effects that low flow conditions related to drought affect the health and long term persistence of a southwestern native cutthroat trout. Through this research, we will recommend management alternatives that might increase the likelihood of populations surviving drought conditions. These could include increasing connectivity of habitat to increase opportunity for fish to move away from areas that go intermittent.","parentId":"55130bdbe4b02e76d75c074f","contacts":[{"name":"Colleen Caldwell","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"ccaldwel@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"5756468126","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"88003","country":"USA","city":"Las Cruces","state":"NM","line1":"P.O.

Loss of habitat due to competition and hybridization with introduced trout and habitat alteration has restricted the remaining 122 populations to small (5.8 km median length) isolated habitat patches.  A recent stream temperature and discharge monitoring program also identified that the majority of occupied habitat patches, while currently thermally suitable for the subspecies, have very low summer baseflows (< 1.0 cfs).  Low baseflows during the summer restrict movement of fish in these small populations and increases the risk of population extirpation due to stochastic disturbances (i.e. drought).   The primary goal of this study is to assess the likelihood of and projected impacts of drought on selected Rio Grande cutthroat trout populations through decreases in stream flow and increases in stream temperature.  Specific study objectives will be to: 1) empirically assess the effects of seasonal stream temperature and discharge on the population vital rates for select Rio Grande cutthroat trout populations considered at risk during drought conditions; and 2) model drought effects on the persistence of Rio Grande cutthroat trout populations.  The second objective includes two sub-objectives: a) model stream discharge, intermittency, and temperature in occupied Rio Grande cutthroat trout streams under drought conditions and b) evaluate how drought conditions will alter population vital rates and persistence of these populations."}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Type","value":"COA"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Number","value":"CM4117"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":84321,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":84321}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":522,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":110238,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2016-08-01T15:49:30.000Z","name":"RioGrandeCutthroatTrout_CraigYoung_MPD.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__5f\/5d\/8a\/5f5d8a1e67b349d57ca05a48b26ab673c8845307","title":"Rio Grande cutthroat trout - Credit: Craig Young","contentType":"image\/jpeg","imageHeight":392,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55366d88e4b0b22a15807cb6?f=__disk__5f%2F5d%2F8a%2F5f5d8a1e67b349d57ca05a48b26ab673c8845307"},{"imageWidth":3264,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-10-20T17:17:58.000Z","title":"Measuring a Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout (photo: A.

This southernmost subspecies of cutthroat trout, found only in New Mexico and Colorado, has already been restricted to an estimated 12% of its former range. Now climate change, in the form of lower winter snowpack and reduced precipitation, challenges its long-term persistence. This trout tends to occupy small and fragmented streams, which are at higher risk of drying up during drought events. Yet, the full extent of drought impacts to Rio Grande cutthroat trout is unknown.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> To address this knowledge gap, researchers are examining the effects of drought - in particular stream intermittency - on the growth and survival of Rio Grande cutthroat trout. Researchers are also exploring how drought is changing the availability of fish habitat. The results of this study will inform managers of suitable Rio Grande cutthroat trout habitat now and under future drought conditions.\n <br> &nbsp;\n<\/div>","purpose":"Rio Grande cutthroat trout (RGCT) is endemic to the Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos River basins of Colorado and New Mexico. Reduced summer stream flow and drought are listed as major threats to its future persistence because most populations of RGCT occupy streams that are small and highly fragmented. Low winter snowpack and reduced seasonal precipitation across the subspecies range since 2010 has resulted in baseflows well below 1.0 cubic foot per second with extended reaches becoming dry. The full extent of how drought will impact RGCT is unknown because only a portion of the populations are monitored annually by management agencies and generally on a single day.  \n\nAnnual monitoring of thermal limits of RGCT populations is ongoing by the project researchers. Thus, additional work on habitat availability and population assessment would occur during annual monitoring surveys (September-October). Researchers plan to model the relationship between habitat availability with landscape data (size of watershed, slope, aspect, land-use) to predict the relationship between stream flow and habitat availability. This data will then be used to inform managers how and where habitat provides sufficient refuge for RGCT during summer base flow and future drought. From this data, the team can recommend how to restore stream reaches.

In the arid Southwest, pronghorn populations have been declining since the 1980s\u2014and it\u2019s thought that drought is partially to blame.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> Average temperatures in the Southwest have increased 1.6\u00b0C since 1950, and the area affected by drought from 2001-2010 was the second largest observed since 1901. Drought conditions have reduced the availability of vegetation, impacting the survival of pronghorns and putting the long-term viability of the species in question, as climate change models predict warmer and drier conditions for the region in the future.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> This project seeks to understand the impacts of drought on pronghorn populations in the Southwest. Specific objectives of the study are to (1) determine the extent of pronghorn population decline; (2) identify the climatic factors that best explain these declines; and (3) use current climate change models to project how a changing climate may effect pronghorn populations in the future. So far, researchers have found that precipitation is strongly linked to pronghorn population growth, and that under future climate scenarios, 9 of 18 studied populations are projected to disappear by the end of the century.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> The results of this project will assist wildlife managers in developing the most appropriate management strategy for pronghorns in the face of climate change and future drought conditions, thus contributing to the long-term conservation of this species in the Southwest. \n<\/div>","purpose":"Many pronghorn populations across the Southwest appear to be declining. In response, managers are applying various techniques in attempts to increase pronghorn numbers often without a clear understanding of the causes of these declines. Some population declines have been associated with drought conditions resulting in reduced forage quality and quantity impacting survival of adults and fawns. Various climate change models predict warmer and drier conditions, which is likely to exacerbate future drought-related population declines, forcing managers to make some difficult decisions regarding the long-term viability of their management practices and the persistence of some pronghorn populations in the Southwest. \n\nIn collaboration with the USFWS, the research team will undertake a meta-analysis of pronghorn population trends in the Southwest in relation to climatic conditions, specifically drought. The specific objectives are to: 1) determine how widespread the decline in American pronghorn is in the Southwest; 2) identify causal, climatic factors which best explain these declines; 3) forecast the trend and geographical extent of these causal, climatic factors over the next century based on current climate change models for the region, including downscaled climate models in development at the SW CSC; and 4) relate these climatic forecasts to pronghorn population trends over future decades. \nQualifying the relationship between climatic conditions and pronghorn population trajectories is central to developing appropriate management actions for pronghorn in the face of climate change. This project will contribute the development of conservation and management plans for American pronghorn populations across the southwestern U.S. Wildlife managers responsible for managing these pronghorn populations will then be more informed and better able to determine where and when particular management strategies can be applied.

Known as phenology, these events are very sensitive to changes in climate. Changes in plant phenology can have cascading effects that impact the herbivore species that depend on the affected plants for food, such as elk, moose, and deer. Therefore, characterizing long term vegetation cycles can provide critical insight into how the behavior and health of a number of species may be altered due to climate change.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> This project seeks to identify how drought conditions influence vegetation phenology, in order to better understand the potential effects on herbivores. Specifically, researchers will examine (1) if drought causes spring&nbsp; green-up to occur earlier in the year; (2) if drought causes a shorter spring green-up period, thus reducing the window during which high-quality vegetation is available for herbivores; and (3) how the spatial patterns of plant productivity vary during drought years.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> Identifying the effects of drought on vegetation will help wildlife managers better understand and predict changes in the behavior and health of herbivores during periods of drought. This information will be particularly important for wildlife managers in regions that are expected to experience increases in the frequency and severity of droughts due to climate change, such as the Southwest and North Central U.S\u2014regions that are home to a number of large herbivore species.\n <br> \n <br> &nbsp; \n<\/div>","purpose":"Herbivore species such as elk, moose, and deer depend on the availability of herbaceous plants and deciduous shrubs for forage.

Project researchers will test three hypotheses with historical NDVI data for the period 2001-2013 for an area of Wyoming that complements prior research on the interactions between vegetation phenology and large herbivore migration behavior and health:\nH1: Drought (and warm) years advance green-up\nH2: Drought years shorten the phenological window for the best quality forage during spring green-up\nH3: Spatial patterns of primary productivity in years with early season drought vary from patterns in other years.

These vegetation types are most nutritious for herbivores from early season to peak green-up, so characterizing vegetation cycles, or phenology, over the long term can provide crucial information towards understanding how shifts in climate could affect the behavior and health of the herbivores.","purpose":"Use satellite data to track changes in vegetation responses during the growing season and document specific events such as start and end of season and growing-season duration. These indicators can reveal phenological trends that are difficult to detect over large areas with ground-based methods.

Recent research suggests that many species may be living close to their upper thermal limits and that some rivers have seen a shift in species composition to more thermally tolerant mussel species. We tested the hypothesis that elevated water temperatures (20, 25, 30, and 35&deg;C) adversely affected the survival and physiology of juvenile mussels and physiology of adult mussels. In juveniles, the 28-d LT50s ranged from 25.3 to 30.3&deg;C. H eart rate was significantly affected by temperature and generally decreased with increasing temperature. Growth rates generally did not vary. In adults, ammonia excretion and oxygen consumption rates after 21-d varied significantly with temperature and generally decreased with increasing temperatures. The O:N ratio varied significantly with temperature in 1 species, as did the tissue condition index. Collectively, these data suggest that juvenile and adult life stages in freshwater mussels can be significantly affected by elevated water temperatures. Estimates of upper thermal tolerances in native mussels are urgently needed because elevated water temperatures caused by global climate change could further challenge already imperiled mussel communities.","parentId":"50748105e4b090654e7b2905","contacts":[{"name":"Alissa M Ganser","oldPartyId":22747,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"aganser@usgs.gov","jobTitle":"UWL Student","firstName":"Alissa","middleName":"M","lastName":"Ganser","organization":{"displayText":"Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"6087816293","streetAddress":{"zip":"54603","country":"USA","city":"La Crosse","state":"WI","line1":"2630 Fanta Reed Road"},"buildingCode":"ARF","name":"Alissa M Ganser\/BRD\/CONT\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"54603","country":"USA","city":"La Crosse","state":"WI","line1":"2630 Fanta Reed Road"},"building":"UMESC"}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/minds.wisconsin.edu\/handle\/1793\/62249","title":"Ganser 2012, UW Master's Thesis","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Freshwater Mussels"},{"name":"thermal tolerance"},{"name":"climate change"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2012-05","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-04-10T09:24:06.969-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-10T09:25:33.976-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Master's Thesis","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","people":["Alissa M Ganser"]},"5274200be4b097f32ac3f2a5":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"5274200be4b097f32ac3f2a5","title":"The Impacts of Drought on Fish and Wildlife in the Southwestern U.S.","body":"<div>\n Species that inhabit the arid Southwest are adapted to living in hot, dry environments. Yet the increasing frequency and severity of drought in the region may create conditions that even these hardy species can\u2019t survive. This project examines the impacts of drought in the southwestern U.S. on four of the region\u2019s iconic species: desert bighorn sheep, American pronghorn, scaled quail, and Rio Grande cutthroat trout. Grasping the impacts of drought on fish and wildlife will be critical for management planning in the Southwest, as climate models project warmer, drier conditions for the region in the future.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> Species are known to respond to environmental changes such as drought in different ways.&nbsp;Often, before changes are observed at the larger population level, they are first noticed at the level of the individual, through changes in an animal\u2019s behavior. For example, when vegetation becomes harder to find during a drought, individuals may increase the amount of time and energy they spend searching for food. If changes in behavior such as these are not sufficient to compensate for the lack of vegetation, the population as a whole could eventually experience decreased survival and reproductive rates.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> Through four sub-projects, researchers are working to improve our knowledge of individual behavioral changes (in the case of desert bighorn sheep) and overall population changes (for pronghorn, trout, and quail) that occur in response to drought.&nbsp;\n<\/div>","purpose":"The responses of individual species to environmental changes can be manifested at multiple levels that range from individual-level (i.e., behavioral responses) to population-level (i.e., demographic) impacts. Major environmental changes that ultimately result in population level impacts are often first detected as individual-level responses. For example, herbivores respond to limited forage availability during drought periods by increasing the duration of foraging periods and expanding home range areas to compensate for the reduction in forage. However, if the individual-level responses are not sufficient to compensate for reduced forage availability, reduced survival and reproductive rates may result. Project researchers will study the impacts of drought on desert bighorn sheep, American pronghorn, Rio Grande cutthroat trout, and scaled quail, including assessments of individual- (e.g., desert bighorn sheep) and population-level (e.g., pronghorn, cutthroat trout, scaled quail) responses to drought.","parentId":"51a4bf80e4b064a995b7a0dd","contacts":[{"name":"James W Cain","oldPartyId":19480,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jwcain@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Assistant Unit Leader, Research Wildlife Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"James","middleName":"W","lastName":"Cain","organization":{"displayText":"New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"5756461281","officePhone":"5756463382","streetAddress":{"zip":"99003","city":"Las Cruces","state":"NM","line1":"2980 Espina St, NM State Univ Knox Hall"},"buildingCode":"KGL","name":"James W Cain\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"88003","country":"USA","city":"Las Cruces","state":"NM","line1":"P.O.

The 23 year climatology (1979\u20132001) of the multidecadal dynamically downscaled simulations forced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction\u2013Department of Energy (NCEP-DOE) Reanalysis II at the lateral boundaries verify quite well with the observed climatology. The variations at diurnal and interannual time scales are also well simulated with respect to the observations. We show from composite analyses made from these downscaled simulations that sea breezes in northwestern Florida are associated with changes in the size of the Atlantic Warm Pool (AWP) on interannual time scales. In large AWP years when the North Atlantic Subtropical High becomes weaker and moves further eastward relative to the small AWP years, a large part of the southeast U.S. including Florida comes under the influence of relatively strong anomalous low-level northerly flow and large-scale subsidence consistent with the theory of the Sverdrup balance. This tends to suppress the diurnal convection over the Florida panhandle coast in large AWP years. This study is also an illustration of the benefit of dynamic downscaling in understanding the low-frequency variations of the sea breeze.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["507466bce4b090654e7b278d"],"contacts":[{"name":"Vasubandhu Misra","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Lauren Moeller","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Lydia Stefanova","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Steven Chan","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"James J.

Through five case histories across the region, we explore how a changing climate has been affecting streams and the potential consequences for trout. Monitoring records show trends in temperature and hydrographs consistent with a warming climate in recent decades. Biological implications include upstream shifts in thermal habitats, risk of egg scour, increased wildfire disturbances, and declining summer habitat volumes. The importance of these factors depends on the context, but temperature increases are most relevant where population boundaries are mediated by thermal constraints. Summer flow declines and wildfires will be important where trout populations are fragmented and constrained to small refugia. A critical information gap is evidence documenting how populations are adjusting to long-term habitat trends, so biological monitoring is a priority. Biological, temperature, and discharge data from monitoring networks could be used to develop accurate vulnerability assessments that provide information regarding where conservation actions would best improve population resilience. Even with better information, future uncertainties will remain large due to unknowns regarding Earth's ultimate warming trajectory and how effects translate across scales. Maintaining or increasing the size of habitats could provide a buffer against these uncertainties.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["506dd262e4b002b5ec71a9a3"],"contacts":[{"name":"Daniel J.

USGS scientists, in partnership with the US Forest Service and Trout Unlimited, completed a database including all existing species distributions and habitat information, and air and water temperature data for the interior West. Maps defining existing and projected future distributions of native salmonids, factoring in anticipated temperature, hydrology, and non-native impacts, alone and in combination, were developed.

persistence of salmonids of the inland west","body":"<p>The Earth's climate warmed steadily during the 20th century, and mean annual air temperatures are estimated to have increased by 0.6\u00b0C (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007). Although many cycles of warming and cooling have occurred in the past, the most recent warming period is unique in its rate and magnitude of change (Siegenthaler and others, 2005) and in its association with anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , 2007). The climate in the western United States warmed in concert with the global trend but at an accelerated rate (+0.8\u00b0C during the 20th century; Saunders and others, 2008). The region could also prove especially sensitive to future changes because the relatively small human population is growing rapidly, as are demands on limited water supplies. <\/p><p>Regional hydrological patterns are dominated by seasonal snow accumulation at upper elevations. Most of the region is relatively dry, and both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are strongly constrained b y water availability (Barnett and others, 2008; Brown and others, 2008). Stream environments are dynamic and climatically extreme, and salmonid fishes are the dominant elements of the native biodiversity (McPhail and Lindsey, 1986; Waples and others, 2008). Salmonids have broad economic and ecologic importance, but a century of intensive water resource development, nonnative fish stocking, and land use has significantly reduced many populations and several taxa are now protected under the Endangered Species Act (Thurow and others, 1997; Trotter, 2008). Because salmonids require relatively pristine, cold water environments and are often isolated in headwater habitats, members of this group may be especially vulnerable to the effects of a warming climate (Keleher and Rahel, 1996; Rieman and others, 2007; Williams and others, 2009).&nbsp;<\/p><p>Warming during the 20th century drove a series of environmental trends that have profound implications for many aspects of salmonid habitat, including disturbance regimes such as wildfire, and unfavorable changes to thermal and hydrologic properties of aquatic systems. Warmer air temperatures have been associated with decreased winter snow accumulations, have accelerated snowmelt, and have&nbsp;advanced the timing of peak runoff by several days to weeks across most of western North America (Stewart and others, 2005; Barnett and others, 2008). Less snow and earlier runoff decrease aquifer recharge, make less water available for groundwater inputs to streams, and are contributing to widespread decreases in summer low flows (Stewart and others, 2005; Rood and others, 2008; Luce and Holden 2009). Interannual variability in stream flow is increasing, as is the persistence of multi-year extreme conditions (McCabe and others, 2004; Pagano and Garen 2005). In many areas of western North America, flood risks have increased in association with warmer temperatures during the 20th century (Hamlet and Lettenmaier, 2005). Streams where midwinter temperatures are near freezing have proven especially sensitive to increased flooding because of associated transitional hydrological patterns (mixtures of rainfall and snowmelt) and propensity for occasional rain-on-snow events to rapidly melt winter snowpack and generate large floods (Hamlet and Lettenmaier, 2005).&nbsp;<\/p><p>Stream temperatures in many areas are increasing (Peterson and Kitchell, 2001; Morrison and others, 2002; Bartholow, 2005; Kaushal and others, 2010), due to both air temperature increases and reduced summer flows that make streams more sensitive to warmer air temperatures (Isaak and others, 2010). In recent decades, wildfires have become more common across much of the western United States during periods of more frequent droughts (Westerling and others, 2006; Hoerling and Eischeid, 2007), and local stream temperature can increase in postfire environments (Gresswell, 1999; Dunham and others, 2007). Fire-related temperature increase within streams is commonly a transient phenomenon, lasting only until riparian vegetation has recovered (Gresswell, 1999); however, ongoing climate change could preclude recovery to higher stature, prefire vegetation types in some areas (McKenzie and others, 2004; van Mantgem and Stephenson, 2007), resulting in a loss of critical riparian shading. Additionally, when wildfires occur in steep mountain topographies, the vegetation that stabilize s soils on hillslopes is often killed and landslides become more prevalent (Gresswell, 1999). Landslides int o stream channels form debris flows composed of sediment slurries and dead trees that can scour channels to bedrock and further exacerbate stream heating, delay recovery of riparian areas, or extirpate fish populations (Gresswell, 1999; May and Gresswell, 2003; Dunham and others, 2007).&nbsp;<\/p><p>Changes in stream environments will shift habitat distributions, sometimes unpredictably, in both time and space for many salmonid fishes. Water temperature fundamentally influences aquatic ecosystem health because distribution, reproduction, fitness, and survival of ectothermic organisms are inextricably linked to the thermal regime of the environment. Historically, research has focused on defining lethal thermal limits of salmonids (Eaton and others, 1995; Selong and others, 2001; Todd and others, 2008); however, water temperature is known to be important in biological processes at a variety of spatial scales and levels of biological organization (Rahel and Olden, 2008; McCullough and others, 2009). For instance, trout are affected directly by water temperature through feeding, metabolism, and growth rates, and indirectly by factors such as prey availability and species interactions (Wehrly and others, 2007; Rahel and Olden, 2008). Where cold water temperatures currently limit habitat suitability and distributions of some species (for example, at the highest and most northerly distributional extents; Nakano and others, 1996; Coleman and Fausch, 2007), a warming climate may gradually increase the quality and extent of suitable habitat. Over time, previously constrained populations are expected to expand into these new habitats and increase in number. Some evidence suggests this may already be happening in Alaska, where streams in recently deglaciated areas are being colonized by emigrants from nearby salmon and char populations (Milner and others, 2000).&nbsp;<\/p><p>Unfortunately, many of the sensitive salmonid species that are often the focus of western managers are unlikely to benefit from future water temperature increases. Warmer stream temperatures will facilitate invasion by nonnative species that are broadly established in downstream areas into upstream areas where they will compete with native species (Rieman and others, 2006; Rahel and&nbsp;Olden, 2008; Fausch and others, 2009). In other cases, warmer stream temperatures will render thermally suitable habitats unsuitable in downstream areas and effect net losses of habitat because upstream distributions are often constrained by streams that are too small or steep (Hari and others, 2006; Isaak and others, 2010). Both scenarios are realistic for fish species like bull trout (<i>Salvelinus confluentus<\/i>) (Rieman and others, 2006; Rieman and others, 2007), the various subspecies of cutthroat trout (<i>Oncorhynchus clarkii<\/i>) (Williams and others, 2009), Gila trout (<i>Oncorhynchus gilae gilae<\/i>) (Kennedy and others, 2008), and Apache trout (<i>Oncorhynchus gilae apache<\/i>) (Rinne and Minckley, 1985; Carmichael and others, 1993). As native species are increasingly confined to smaller and more isolated habitats by a gradually warming climate, the effects of wildfires (whether related to lethal changes in water quality during a fire, channel debris flows, or chronic postfire warming ) could have greater proportional effects on remaining habitats (for example, Brown and others, 2001; Rieman and others, 2007). If these changes were accompanied by additional hydrologic alterations associated with changes to the magnitude, frequency, duration, timing, and rate of change of discharge patterns (Jager and others, 1999; Henderson and others, 2000), populations may begin to lose some of their historic resilience and become ever more susceptible to local extirpations.&nbsp;<\/p><p>As dramatic and extensive as climatic and environmental trends are for salmonid habitats, global climate models (GCMs) project that many of these trends will continue and even accelerate until at least the middle of the 21st century (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007). Current projections suggest mean annual air temperatures will increase by an additional 1\u20133\u00b0C, and early indications are that climate trajectory is at the higher end of this range (Pittock, 2006; Raupach and others, 2007). Although predicted changes vary considerably, even the most conservative estimates suggest a warming rate that will be twice that observed during the 20th century. Projections for the midcentury are most certainly due to the effects of greenhouse gases already emitted or predicted in the short term, uncertainties of the effects of longer-term greenhouse gas emissions, short-term climate cycles, and process errors associated with climate models (Cox and Stephenson, 2007). Projections of changes in total precipitation are less certain than those for air temperatures, but most GCMs project relatively small changes in the Northwest, with the exception of slightly drier summer periods (Mote and others, 2008; Karl and others, 2009). In the Southwest, however, significant decreases (such as 15\u201330 percent ) are projected during most periods of the year, and this area is one of the few for which Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) precipitation projections have a high level of certainty (Hoerling and Eischeid, 2007; Karl and others, 2009). Clearly, managers of native salmonids in the wester n United States should consider adjusting management strategies to accommodate a warmer and possibly drier future (Williams and others, 2009). Tools are needed to forecast where important changes may occur and how conservation efforts should be prioritized. In this Open-File Report, we document our initial efforts in this regard for 10 species and subspecies of inland trout and Montana Arctic grayling (<i>Thymallus arcticus<\/i>) across the western United States.&nbsp;<\/p><p><br><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["4f4e6ccde4b07f02db6b597f","5016fae3e4b06fb5ce8b7404","506dd262e4b002b5ec71a9a3"],"contacts":[{"name":"A.L.

The surge amplitude decreases at a rate of 40\u201350 cm\/km across the mangrove forest and at a rate of 20 cm\/km across the areas with a mixture of mangrove islands with open water. In contrast, the amplitudes of storm surges at the front of the mangrove zone increase by about 10\u201330% because of the \u201cblockage\u201d of mangroves to surge water, which can cause greater impacts on structures at the front of mangroves than the case without mangroves. The mangrove forest can also protect the wetlands behind the mangrove zone against surge inundation from a Category 5 hurricane with a fast forward speed of 11.2 m\/s (25 mph). However, the forest cannot fully attenuate storm surges from a Category 5 hurricane with a slow forward speed of 2.2 m\/s (5 mph) and reduced surges can still affect the wetlands behind the mangrove zone. The effects of widths of mangrove zones on reducing surge amplitudes are nonlinear with large reduction rates (15\u201330%) for initial width increments and small rates (&lt;5%) for subsequent width increments.","parentId":"507466bce4b090654e7b278d","contacts":[{"name":"Keqi Zhang","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Florida International University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Huiqing Liu","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Florida International University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Yuepeng Li","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Florida International University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Hongzhou Xu","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Florida International University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jian Shen","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"College of William & Mary"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jamie Rhome","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"National Hurricane Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Thomas J.

In freshwater systems, these changes may result in degradation or loss of habitat due to dry stream beds or low flows, and increased water temperatures, pollution, and erosion. Freshwater mussels (Order Unionida) are especially vulnerable to disturbance because they are incapable of escaping detrimental changes at any practical temporal scale. Quantitative information on lethal temperatures (LT) to native freshwater mussels is currently limited to fewer than 10 species, and these few studies have been restricted to the water-only standard method for toxicity testing. The results of these prior studies indicate that some species may be living near their upper thermal tolerances; however, evaluation of the thermal sensitivity of these benthic organisms has never been conducted in sediment. Thus, I sought to increase the complexity and ecological realism of laboratory exposures of freshwater mussels to acute thermal stress by including factors that affect mussels in natural systems, including sediment, flow regime, and a vertical thermal gradient. I developed a method for assessing thermal sensitivity of freshwater mussels in sediment, and, using these testing protocols, I evaluated the relative sensitivities of juveniles of four species (Amblema plicata, Lampsilis abrupta, Lampsilis cariosa, and Lampsilis siliquoidea) and adults of one species (Lampsilis fasciola) to a range of temperatures common during summer in streams with low flow and drought conditions, using two temperature acclimation (22 and 27&deg;C) and surrogate flow regimes (low water and dewatered treatments). I then added a vertical sediment temperature gradient and evaluated the thermal sensitivities of two species (Lampsilis abrupta and Lampsilis radiata). Endpoints were survival, burrowing behavior, byssus production (in juveniles), and biomarkers of thermal stress (in adults). Acute (96-h) median lethal temperatures (LT50s) ranged from 29.9 to 37.2&deg;C, with a grand mean of 34.8&deg;C, indicating a narrow range of upper thermal sensitivity, regardless of test type, species, life stage, or conservation status. LT50s from sediment tests generally did not differ from water-only tests, suggesting that any stream thermal refuge would emanate from other ecological or physical habitat interactions. Increasing temperature significantly reduced burrowing and byssus production in the species tested. Elevated concentrations of stress biomarkers were detected in some experiments. My findings suggest that rising stream temperatures and altered hydrologic flows from climate change and other anthropogenic factors may directly impact freshwater mussel diversity by causing mortality, and may have indirect sublethal effects.","parentId":"50748105e4b090654e7b2905","contacts":[{"name":"Jennifer Michele Archambault","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"North Carolina State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/repository.lib.ncsu.edu\/ir\/handle\/1840.16\/8144","title":"Archambault 2012, NCSU Master's Thesis","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"freshwater mussels"},{"name":"climate change"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2012","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-04-10T09:14:16.462-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-10T09:22:10.105-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Master's Thesis","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","people":["Jennifer Michele Archambault"]},"5527e581e4b026915857c8b3":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/4f833d7be4b0e84f608680d1","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Thermal tolerances of freshwater mussels and their host fishes: species interactions in a changing climate","relatedTitle":"Modeling the Response of Freshwater Mussels to Changes in Water Temperature, Habitat, and Streamflow","id":"5527e581e4b026915857c8b3","relatedId":"4f833d7be4b0e84f608680d1","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5527e581e4b026915857c8b3","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Modeling the Response of Freshwater Mussels to Changes in Water Temperature, Habitat, and Streamflow","relatedTitle":"Thermal tolerances of freshwater mussels and their host fishes: species interactions in a changing climate","id":"4f833d7be4b0e84f608680d1","relatedId":"5527e581e4b026915857c8b3","annotation":null}]},"id":"5527e581e4b026915857c8b3","title":"Thermal tolerances of freshwater mussels and their host fishes: species interactions in a changing climate","body":"Abstract:&nbsp;Rising environmental temperatures result from changes in land use and global climate and can cause significant shifts in the composition and distribution of species within communities. In freshwater systems, the larval life stage, glochidia, of Unionida mussels develops as an obligate parasite on host fish gills or fins before transforming into the juvenile stage and dropping to the sediment to complete the life cycle. Because of the relationship between freshwater mussels and their often specific host fish species, mussels are not only limited by their own variable thermal tolerances, but also by those of their host fish. Our intent was to compile data from available literature regarding thermal sensitivities of eight species of freshwater mussels and their host fishes, to determine if the community structure of these systems is at risk from rising environmental temperatures. Mussels were both more and less thermally sensitive than specific host fish species (2.9 &ordm;C mean absolute difference between mussel and host; range = 0 \u2013 6.8 &ordm;C). In 62% of mussel-host fish comparisons, freshwater mussels were more thermally tolerant than their hosts (3.4 &ordm;C mean difference; range = 0.2 \u2013 6.8 &ordm;C), suggesting that some mussels are effectively more stenothermic than tolerance criteria indicate, which may pose additional environmental risk. Further analysis revealed that variation in mussel thermal tolerance could not be attributed to mussel acclimation temperature, species, life stage, or mean host fish thermal tolerance, suggesting that mussel thermal tolerance is controlled by multiple interacting and complex factors. Our findings in this meta-analysis suggest that thermal effects of anthropogenic landscape alteration and climate change may be compounded for freshwater mussels via their obligate life cycle interaction with fish and highlight the importance of considering global change effects in a community context.","parentId":"50748105e4b090654e7b2905","contacts":[{"name":"Tamara J.

Few studies on the Pacific coast of North America have modeled sea-level rise marsh susceptibility at a scale relevant to local wildlife populations and plant communities. Here, we use a novel approach in developing an empirical sea-level rise ecological response model that can be applied to key management questions. Calculated elevation change over 13 y for a 324-ha portion of San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge, California, USA, was used to represent local accretion and subsidence processes. Next, we coupled detailed plant community and elevation surveys with measured rates of inundation frequency to model marsh state changes to 2100. By grouping plant communities into low, mid, and high marsh habitats, we were able to assess wildlife species vulnerability and to better understand outcomes for habitat resiliency. Starting study-site conditions were comprised of 78% (253-ha) high marsh, 7% (30-ha) mid marsh, and 4% (18-ha) low marsh habitats, dominated by pickleweed <i>Sarcocornia pacifica<\/i> and cordgrass <i>Spartina<\/i> spp. Only under the low sea-level rise scenario (44 cm by 2100) did our models show persistence of some marsh habitats to 2100, with the area dominated by low marsh habitats. Under mid (93 cm by 2100) and high sea-level rise scenarios (166 cm by 2100), most mid and high marsh habitat was lost by 2070, with only 15% (65 ha) remaining, and a complete loss of these habitats by 2080. Low marsh habitat increased temporarily under all three sea-level rise scenarios, with the peak (286 ha) in 2070, adding habitat for the endemic endangered California Ridgway\u2019s rail <i>Rallus obsoletus obsoletus<\/i>. Under mid and high sea-level rise scenarios, an almost complete conversion to mudflat occurred, with most of the area below mean sea level. Our modeling assumed no marsh migration upslope due to human levee and infrastructure preventing these types of processes. Other modeling efforts done for this area have projected marsh persistence to 2100, but our modeling effort with site-specific datasets allowed us to model at a finer resolution with much higher local confidence, resulting in different results for management. Our results suggest that projected sea-level rise will have significant impacts on marsh plant communities and obligate wildlife, including those already under federal and state protection. Comprehensive modeling as done here improves the potential to implement adaptive management strategies and prevent marsh habitat and wildlife loss in the future.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50782a12e4b0df5513bf60f9"],"contacts":[{"name":"Karen M.

The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) include 300,000 km2&nbsp;of ocean waters and 10 groups of&nbsp;sub-tropical islands and atolls of high conservation value. Designated as Papahanaumokuakea&nbsp;Marine National Monument, the islands provide habitat for four endangered species of terrestrial&nbsp;birds. Despite their protected status, many of these species are faced with the ongoing threat of&nbsp;extinction due to stochastic catastrophes such as disease, invasive mammal introductions,&nbsp;tsunamis, and hurricanes.&nbsp;A longer term threat to NWHI species is sea level rise associated with global climate change. On a 50-year time scale, many low-lying NWHI may be partially inundated or totally submerged by rising sea levels.&nbsp;The Laysan Duck (LADU; Anas laysanensis) is one of the terrestrial species in the NWHI faced with these ecological threats.&nbsp;The purpose of this project is to identify the optimal sequence of decisions that will protect the LADU in perpetuity in the face of sea level rise and other identified threats. As part of a larger U.S. Geological Survey-funded research project, \u201cPredicting risks of island extinctions due to sea level rise: Model based tools to mitigate terrestrial habitat losses in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands,\u201d we are interested in developing decision-support tools to help Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and recovery managers decide how to best manage endemic birds vulnerable to extinction from sea level rise. Managers will need to work together with state and other federal wildlife agencies to develop and implement a sea level rise management plan. Developing such a plan for the LADU will provide a prototype management tool useful for the three other endangered terrestrial birds in the NWHI (the Laysan Finch, the Nihoa Finch, and the Nihoa Millerbird), as well as seabirds and endangered terrestrial plants.&nbsp;","parentId":"5074818fe4b090654e7b292e","contacts":[{"name":"Michelle H Reynolds","oldPartyId":8560,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"mreynolds@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Wildlife Biologist","firstName":"Michelle","middleName":"H","lastName":"Reynolds","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8089678568","officePhone":"8089856416","streetAddress":{"zip":"96718","country":"US","city":"Hawaii National Park","state":"HI","line1":"P.O Box 44\r\nCrater Rim drive\r\nBld 344"},"buildingCode":"WHF","name":"Michelle H Reynolds\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"96718","country":"USA","city":"Hawaii National Park","state":"HI","line1":"P.O.

Although anglers and other resource users could be greatly affected by changes in species distributions, predicted changes are rarely reported in ways that can be easily understood by the general public. In contrast, climate science that more directly affects human welfare or livelihoods is often more readily communicated to the general public because it is of greater concern or closely related to everyday life.

Understanding historical streamflow characteristics provides relevant guidance to adaptive management of these water resources. Streamflow records in the Missouri River watershed were examined for trends in time series of annual, seasonal, and monthly streamflow. A total of 227 streamgages having continuous observational records for water years 1960\u20132011 were examined. Kendall\u2019s tau nonparametric test was used to determine statistical significance of trends in annual, seasonal, and monthly streamflow. A trend was considered statistically significant for a probability value less than or equal to 0.10 that the Kendall\u2019s tau value equals zero. Significant trends in annual streamflow were indicated for 101 out of a total of 227 streamgages. The Missouri River watershed was divided into six watershed regions and trends within regions were examined. The western and the southern parts of the Missouri River watershed had downward trends in annual streamflow (56 streamgages), whereas the eastern part of the watershed had upward trends in streamflow (45 streamgages). Seasonal and monthly streamflow trends reflected prevailing annual streamflow trends within each watershed region.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50746778e4b090654e7b27af"],"contacts":[{"name":"Parker A.

The uncertain and relatively rapid changes to precipitation patterns pose a significant challenge to managers and decision-makers. In addition to having negative social and economic implications, long periods without rainfall can alter ecosystems, thereby threatening fish and wildlife species.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> The term \u201cecological drought\u201d emphasizes the environmental consequences of future droughts. While it is known that ecological drought places multiple stresses on the environment, many of the specific impacts are not fully understood. To address this need, researchers are working to synthesize knowledge on the impacts of ecological drought across the country and to develop tools and products that are useful for decision making.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> A series of eight workshops aimed at synthesizing our existing knowledge of the ecological impacts of drought are planned for each of the eight Department of Interior Climate Science Centers. These workshops will culminate in a national synthesis describing the state of our knowledge of ecological drought. Additionally, a group of scientists from the University of Maryland\u2019s Integration and Application Network (IAN) \u2013 a group specializing in science communication \u2013 will develop related communication products that effectively deliver the results to stakeholders.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> These regional drought syntheses represent a significant step towards addressing the challenges mangers face in coping with the impacts of drought. Contributing to better informed drought management plans that protect ecosystems and the critical services that they provide is essential for conserving&nbsp;resources vulnerable to climate change impacts.\n<\/div>","purpose":"Prolonged drought has the potential to negatively affect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems by limiting soil moisture and other water supplies that are important for biological function. Because of increasing concerns about the effects of \u201cecological drought\u201d on natural resources and how those effects may vary in different regions of the country, the USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC) and DOI Climate Science Centers (CSCs) have undertaken an effort to synthesize knowledge related to the regional impacts of ecological drought and develop tools and products that are relevant for decision making. However, providing management-relevant science can be difficult without the effective delivery of information. The Integration and Application Network (IAN), an initiative of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, is a collection of scientists who specialize in effective science integration, synthesis, and communication, and has been tasked with assisting NCCWSC in synthesizing and communicating information developed and collected throughout its CSC network. A series of 8 workshops will be held in each of the 8 CSC regions. These workshops are aimed at collating our existing knowledge of the ecological impacts, resistance, and adaptation from drought across the U.S. The regional workshops will culminate in a national synthesis project where representatives from each CSC will join together to write and publish several papers describing the state of our knowledge on ecological drought. This work will enhance NCCWSC\u2019s ability to prepare the information and tools generated from its CSCs for management uptake.","parentId":"55130bdbe4b02e76d75c074f","contacts":[{"name":"NCCWSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","organizationsPerson":"Shawn L.

Hierarchical modeling of urban growth across the conterminous USA: developing meso-scale quantity drivers for the Land Transformation Model. Journal of Land Use Science, 2012<\/span><\/p> \n<p> <span>The Land Transformation Model (LTM) is hierarchically coupled with meso-scale drivers to project urban growth across the conterminous USA. Quantity of urban growth 10 at county and place (i.e., city) scales is simulated using population, urban density and nearest neighbor dependent attributes. We compared three meso-scale LTMs to three null models that lack meso-scale drivers. Models were developed using circa 1990\u20132000 data and validated using change in the 2001 and 2006 National Land Cover Databases (NLCD). LTM and null models were assessed using the mean difference 15 in quantity between simulated and actual growth measured at multiple spatial scales. We found that LTM models performed relatively well at spatial scales as small as 450 m, and that the mean difference between the NLCD and LTM with meso-scale drivers at 900 m was 2\u20133%, whereas null models produced a mean difference of \u223c5%. Thus, introducing meso-scale modules into large-scale LTM simulations significantly 20 increases model accuracy.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"50748007e4b090654e7b28d1","linkParentIds":["5447fa44e4b0f888a81b868f"],"contacts":[{"name":"Jarrod Doucette","type":"Point of Contact","organizationsPerson":"Jarrod

Hierarchical modeling of urban growth across the conterminous USA: developing meso-scale quantity drivers for the Land Transformation Model. Journal of Land Use Science, 2012<\/p> \n<p> The Land Transformation Model (LTM) is hierarchically coupled with meso-scale drivers to project urban growth across the conterminous USA. Quantity of urban growth 10 at county and place (i.e., city) scales is simulated using population, urban density and nearest neighbor dependent attributes. We compared three meso-scale LTMs to three null models that lack meso-scale drivers. Models were developed using circa 1990\u20132000 data and validated using change in the 2001 and 2006 National Land Cover Databases (NLCD). LTM and null models were assessed using the mean difference 15 in quantity between simulated and actual growth measured at multiple spatial scales. We found that LTM models performed relatively well at spatial scales as small as 450 m, and that the mean difference between the NLCD and LTM with meso-scale drivers at 900 m was 2\u20133%, whereas null models produced a mean difference of \u223c5%. Thus, introducing meso-scale modules into large-scale LTM simulations significantly 20 increases model accuracy.<\/p>","parentId":"50748007e4b090654e7b28d1","linkParentIds":["5447fa44e4b0f888a81b868f"],"contacts":[{"name":"Bryan Pijanowski","type":"Principal

Hierarchical modeling of urban growth across the conterminous USA: developing meso-scale quantity drivers for the Land Transformation Model. Journal of Land Use Science, 2012<\/p> \n<p> The Land Transformation Model (LTM) is hierarchically coupled with meso-scale drivers to project urban growth across the conterminous USA. Quantity of urban growth 10 at county and place (i.e., city) scales is simulated using population, urban density and nearest neighbor dependent attributes. We compared three meso-scale LTMs to three null models that lack meso-scale drivers. Models were developed using circa 1990\u20132000 data and validated using change in the 2001 and 2006 National Land Cover Databases (NLCD). LTM and null models were assessed using the mean difference 15 in quantity between simulated and actual growth measured at multiple spatial scales. We found that LTM models performed relatively well at spatial scales as small as 450 m, and that the mean difference between the NLCD and LTM with meso-scale drivers at 900 m was 2\u20133%, whereas null models produced a mean difference of \u223c5%. Thus, introducing meso-scale modules into large-scale LTM simulations significantly 20 increases model accuracy.<\/p>","parentId":"50748007e4b090654e7b28d1","linkParentIds":["5447fa44e4b0f888a81b868f"],"contacts":[{"name":"Jarrod Doucette","type":"Point of Contact","hours":"9:00 AM - 5:00 PM

Hierarchical modeling of urban growth across the conterminous USA: developing meso-scale quantity drivers for the Land Transformation Model. Journal of Land Use Science, 2012<\/p> \n<p> The Land Transformation Model (LTM) is hierarchically coupled with meso-scale drivers to project urban growth across the conterminous USA. Quantity of urban growth 10 at county and place (i.e., city) scales is simulated using population, urban density and nearest neighbor dependent attributes. We compared three meso-scale LTMs to three null models that lack meso-scale drivers. Models were developed using circa 1990\u20132000 data and validated using change in the 2001 and 2006 National Land Cover Databases (NLCD). LTM and null models were assessed using the mean difference 15 in quantity between simulated and actual growth measured at multiple spatial scales. We found that LTM models performed relatively well at spatial scales as small as 450 m, and that the mean difference between the NLCD and LTM with meso-scale drivers at 900 m was 2\u20133%, whereas null models produced a mean difference of \u223c5%. Thus, introducing meso-scale modules into large-scale LTM simulations significantly 20 increases model accuracy.<\/p> \n<p>

Hierarchical modeling of urban growth across the conterminous USA: developing meso-scale quantity drivers for the Land Transformation Model. Journal of Land Use Science, 2012<\/p> \n<p> The Land Transformation Model (LTM) is hierarchically coupled with meso-scale drivers to project urban growth across the conterminous USA. Quantity of urban growth 10 at county and place (i.e., city) scales is simulated using population, urban density and nearest neighbor dependent attributes. We compared three meso-scale LTMs to three null models that lack meso-scale drivers. Models were developed using circa 1990\u20132000 data and validated using change in the 2001 and 2006 National Land Cover Databases (NLCD). LTM and null models were assessed using the mean difference 15 in quantity between simulated and actual growth measured at multiple spatial scales. We found that LTM models performed relatively well at spatial scales as small as 450 m, and that the mean difference between the NLCD and LTM with meso-scale drivers at 900 m was 2\u20133%, whereas null models produced a mean difference of \u223c5%. Thus, introducing meso-scale modules into large-scale LTM simulations significantly 20 increases model accuracy.<\/p>","parentId":"50748007e4b090654e7b28d1","linkParentIds":["5447fa44e4b0f888a81b868f"],"contacts":[{"name":"Jarrod Doucette","type":"Point of Contact","hours":"9:00 AM - 5:00 PM

Climate Change Project","body":"<p>The Southeastern U.S. spans broad ranges of physiographic settings and contains a wide variety of aquatic systems that provide habitat for hundreds of endemic aquatic species that pose interesting challenges and opportunities for managers of aquatic resources, particularly in the face of climate change. For example, the Southeast contains the southernmost populations of the eastern brook trout and other cold-water dependent species. Climate change is predicted to increase temperatures in the South and is likely to have a substantial effect on extant populations of cold-water biota. Thus, aquatic managers are tasked with developing strategies for preserving cold-water dependent biota, such as eastern brook trout, and for providing new conservation opportunities in ecosystems that will be transitioning from cold-&nbsp;or cool-water ecosystems to warm-water ecosystems.&nbsp;This joint-project with the US Forest Service developed integrated tools that allow natural resource managers to develop and evaluate strategies for minimizing the effect of climate change on aquatic ecosystems and related ecosystem services. This is one of two concurrent studies. The second study is located&nbsp;in the Pacific Northwest and addressess the effects of potential temperature and flow fluctuations due to climate change on salmon, trout, and chars.&nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"52273b87e4b01904cf5a8187","contacts":[{"name":"William B Hughes","oldPartyId":4831,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"wbhughes@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Supervisory Hydrologist","firstName":"William","middleName":"B","lastName":"Hughes","cellPhone":"4042776934","organization":{"displayText":"Georgia Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"6789246710","officePhone":"6789246657","streetAddress":{"zip":"30093","city":"Norcross","state":"GA","line1":"1770 Corporate Drive Suite 500"},"buildingCode":"AYE","name":"William B Hughes\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"30360-2824","country":"USA","city":"Atlanta","state":"GA","line1":"3039 Amwiler Road, Suite 130"},"building":"GA WSC & SE Rex Offices"}},{"name":"C.

The development of future scenarios (of climate change, socioeconomic conditions, land use changes, and ecological responses) can help state and federal managers understand plausible ecological futures, vulnerabilities, and opportunities as a result of climate change and related stressors. While scenario planning is increasingly being proposed as a useful method for addressing climate change uncertainties in land and wildlife management, there is a need for additional models that show proof of concept of how management plans and decisions can be informed by scenario planning. We therefore propose to conduct a pilot scenario-planning project aimed at informing land and wildlife management, with a specific focus on moose in the north woods of the United States. Outputs from the project will be designed to inform State Wildlife Action Plans and\/or other relevant wildlife and land management plans in the region, while also providing a model for how scenario planning might be useful for other systems and geographies. The goal of the proposed project is to design and implement a pilot scenario planning effort over the next 18 months that provides (a) information on climate change impacts and adaptation options that can be incorporated into State Wildlife Action Plans and\/or other relevant management plans affecting moose and their habitats in the Northeast; and (b) proof of concept and a learning opportunity on how scenario planning can be used to bring existing research and analyses to bear on timely management decision-making and planning by state agencies.","parentId":"53beaa25e4b0527d5d411803","contacts":[{"name":"Molly Cross","oldPartyId":64729,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"mcross@wcs.org","active":true,"firstName":"Molly","lastName":"Cross","organization":{"displayText":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"NCCWSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Erika Rowland","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"NCCWSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"},{"name":"Scenario Planning"},{"name":"boreal forest"},{"name":"hardwoods"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-09-17","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2016-09-16","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-11-12T14:49:43.082-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-27T02:42:30.644-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":105308,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2014","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":105308}]}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":569659,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-12-14T18:07:43.000Z","name":"Moose photo permission.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__c0\/d2\/ce\/c0d2cec8bb563b5f9219cc5d294d5770c16787d1","title":"Photo Permission David Wattles","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5463d5f7e4b0ba83040c76fa?f=__disk__c0%2Fd2%2Fce%2Fc0d2cec8bb563b5f9219cc5d294d5770c16787d1"},{"imageWidth":2816,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":2794978,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2015-12-14T18:08:22.000Z","name":"Moose (David Wattles).JPG","pathOnDisk":"__disk__c3\/f5\/a0\/c3f5a0da8c712f293bc2d8dc792e89cf2c7bbe29","title":"Moose -

The response of salmonids to climate change will vary through space and time and manifest in both known and currently unknown ways. A potentially rich source of understanding of how salmonids interact with climate lies in a unified retrospective analysis of observed climate and population data in diverse habitats across the United States. Through research and management partners, tens of thousands of sampling events have occurred and continue to occur across the ranges of native salmonid species. We propose to capitalize on existing fish population and climate data from the recent past (1950-current) to: 1) test species-climate hypotheses, 2) identify mechanisms linking species to climate drivers, 3) validate current forecasting models, and 4) improve monitoring programs, vulnerability assessments, and risk assessment tools. An inherent benefit of this approach is the use of empirical climate and species population data, thus minimizing the uncertainty associated with extrapolations and climate projections.","parentId":"53beaa25e4b0527d5d411803","contacts":[{"name":"Jeffrey L Kershner","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jkershner@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Center Director","firstName":"Jeffrey","middleName":"L","lastName":"Kershner","cellPhone":"4065995001","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"4069946556","officePhone":"4069945304","streetAddress":{"zip":"59715","city":"Bozeman","state":"MT","line1":"2327 UNIVERSITY WAY"},"buildingCode":"KKO","name":"Jeffrey L Kershner\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"59715","country":"USA","city":"Bozeman","state":"MT","line1":"2327 University Way, Suite 2"},"building":"THE TRANSPORTATION AND SYSTEMS"}},{"name":"Robert Al-Chockhacy","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Clint C Muhlfeld","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"cmuhlfeld@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Clint","middleName":"C","lastName":"Muhlfeld","cellPhone":"4066009686","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"4068887923","officePhone":"4068887926","streetAddress":{"zip":"59936","city":"West Glacier","state":"MT","line1":"295 MATHER DR, Park Headquarters"},"buildingCode":"KKF","name":"Clint C Muhlfeld\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"59936-0128","country":"USA","city":"West Glacier","state":"MT","line1":"USGS Building, Park Headquarters"},"building":"OA - NPS"}},{"name":"Colleen A Caldwell","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"ccaldwel@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Unit Leader Research Fish Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Colleen","middleName":"A","lastName":"Caldwell","organization":{"displayText":"New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"5756461281","officePhone":"5756468126","streetAddress":{"zip":"99003","city":"Las Cruces","state":"NM","line1":"2980 Espina St, NM State Univ Knox Hall, Knox Hall"},"buildingCode":"KGL","name":"Colleen A Caldwell\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"88003","country":"USA","city":"Las Cruces","state":"NM","line1":"P.O.

Due to their small size and the relatively dry climate of the region, these wetlands are considered at high risk for negative climate change effects as temperatures increase. To estimate the potential impacts of climate change on breeding waterbirds, we predicted current and future distributions of species common in the PPR using species distribution models (SDMs). We created regional-scale SDMs for the U.S. PPR using Breeding Bird Survey occurrence records for 1971\u20132011 and wetland, upland, and climate variables. For each species, we predicted current distribution based on climate records for 1981\u20132000 and projected future distributions to climate scenarios for 2040\u20132049. Species were projected to, on average, lose almost half their current habitat (-46%). However, individual species projections varied widely, from +8% (Upland Sandpiper) to -100% (Wilson's Snipe). Variable importance ranks indicated that land cover (wetland and upland) variables were generally more important than climate variables in predicting species distributions. However, climate variables were relatively more important during a drought period. Projected distributions of species responses to climate change contracted within current areas of distribution rather than shifting. Given the large variation in species-level impacts, we suggest that climate change mitigation efforts focus on species projected to be the most vulnerable by enacting targeted wetland management, easement acquisition, and restoration efforts.","parentId":"50746778e4b090654e7b27af","contacts":[{"name":"Valerie Steen","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":""},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Susan K.

The majority of these streams had no previous record of continual temperature records. When compared to Colorado water temperature criteria (Cold Tier 1), a portion of these populations appeared to be at risk from elevated stream temperatures, as indicated by exceedance of both acute and chronic water quality metrics. Summer water temperature profiles recorded at sites within current Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout habitat indicated that although the majority of currently occupied conservation streams have temperatures that fall well below these biologically based acute and chronic thermal thresholds, several sites may be at or approaching water temperatures considered stressful to Cutthroat Trout.","purpose":"The purpose of this data release is to provide general access to these stream temperature data sets. The dataset facilitates the comparison of stream temperature with the acute and chronic temperature threshold of Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout in order to identify at risk populations. This comparison can be used by managers for decisions regarding the current and future thermal suitability of existing Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout populations as well as potential restoration sites.","parentId":"5274215be4b097f32ac3f3d5","linkParentIds":["56670dcfe4b06a3ea36c8be0","5474ec49e4b04d7459a7eab2","52742195e4b097f32ac3f3e0"],"contacts":[{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey - ScienceBase","type":"Distributor","email":"sciencebase@usgs.gov","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"U.S. Geological Survey - ScienceBase - Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80225","country":"United States","mailStopCode":"302","city":"Denver","state":"CO","line2":"Building 810","line1":"Denver Federal Center"}}},{"name":"Andrew Todd","oldPartyId":10434,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"atodd@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Todd","organization":{"displayText":"Crustal Imaging and Characterization Team"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"3032361426","streetAddress":{"zip":"80225","city":"Lakewood","state":"CO","line1":"W 6th Ave Kipling St"},"buildingCode":"KAC","name":"Andrew Todd\/GD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80225-0046","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"964D","city":"Denver","state":"CO","line1":"Box 25046, Denver Federal Center, Mail Stop 964D"},"building":"DFC Bldg 20"}},{"name":"Ben N Mcgee","oldPartyId":69223,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"bmcgee@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Physical Science Technician","firstName":"Ben","middleName":"N","lastName":"Mcgee","organization":{"displayText":"Crustal Imaging and Characterization Team"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"3032361403","streetAddress":{"zip":"80225","country":"US","city":"Lakewood","state":"CO","line1":"W 6th Ave Kipling St"},"buildingCode":"KAC","name":"CN=Ben N Mcgee,OU=Non USGS,OU=CIC,OU=Users,OU=DenverCO-G MRT-CIC,OU=DenverCO-M,OU=CR,DC=gs,DC=doi,DC=net - Primary Location","mailAddress":[],"building":"DFC Bldg 20"}},{"name":"Mathew Zeigler","oldPartyId":68855,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"zeiglerm@nmsu.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Mathew","lastName":"Zeigler","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Colleen A Caldwell","oldPartyId":1481,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"ccaldwel@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Unit Leader Research Fish Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Colleen","middleName":"A","lastName":"Caldwell","organization":{"displayText":"New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"5756461281","officePhone":"5756468126","streetAddress":{"zip":"88003","city":"Las Cruces","state":"NM","line1":"2980 Espina St, NM State Univ Knox Hall"},"buildingCode":"KGL","name":"Colleen A Caldwell\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"88003","country":"USA","city":"Las Cruces","state":"NM","line1":"P.O.

Declines in the abundance and diversity of North American mussels have been attributed to human activities that cause pollution, waterquality degradation, and habitat destruction. Recent studies suggest that effects of climate change may also endanger native mussel assemblages, as many mussel species are living close to their upper thermal tolerances. Adult and juvenile mussels spend a large fraction of their lives burrowed into sediments of rivers and lakes. Our objective was to measure surface water and sediment temperatures at known mussel beds in the Upper Mississippi (UMR) and St. Croix (SCR) rivers to estimate the potential for sediments to serve as thermal refugia. Across four mussel beds in the UMR and SCR, surface waters were generally warmer than sediments in summer, and were cooler than sediments in winter. This suggests that sediments may act as a thermal buffer for mussels in these large rivers. Although the magnitude of this effect was usually &lt;3.0&deg;C, sediments were up to 7.5&deg;C cooler at one site in May, suggesting site-specific variation in the ability of sediments to act as thermal buffers. Sediment temperatures in the UMR exceeded those shown to cause mortality in laboratory studies. These data suggest that elevated water temperatures resulting from global warming, thermal discharges, water extraction, and\/or droughts have the potential to adversely affect native mussel assemblages.","parentId":"50748105e4b090654e7b2905","contacts":[{"name":"Teresa Newton","oldPartyId":7464,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"tnewton@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"RESEARCH FISHERY BIOLOGIST","firstName":"Teresa","lastName":"Newton","organization":{"displayText":"Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"6087836066","officePhone":"6087816217","streetAddress":{"zip":"54603","city":"La Crosse","state":"WI","line1":"2630 Fanta Reed Road"},"buildingCode":"ARF","name":"Teresa Newton\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"54603","country":"USA","city":"La Crosse","state":"WI","line1":"2630 Fanta Reed Road"},"building":"UMESC - LABORATORY\/OFFICE - #1"}},{"name":"Jennifer S Sauer","oldPartyId":9037,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"jsauer@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"BIOLOGIST","personalTitle":"Ms.","firstName":"Jennifer","middleName":"S","lastName":"Sauer","organization":{"displayText":"Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"6087836066","officePhone":"6087816376","streetAddress":{"zip":"54603","country":"US","city":"La Crosse","state":"WI","line1":"2630 Fanta Reed Road"},"buildingCode":"ARF","name":"Jennifer S Sauer\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"54603","country":"USA","city":"La Crosse","state":"WI","line1":"2630 Fanta Reed Road"},"building":"UMESC"}},{"name":"Byron Karns","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"National Park Service"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"freshwater mussels"},{"name":"Climate change"},{"name":"Mississippi River"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-04-10T09:05:17.371-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-10T09:08:33.339-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Walkerana","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Volume","value":"16"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Number ","value":"2"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Pages","value":"53-62"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":636383,"dateUploaded":"2015-04-10T15:05:52.000Z","name":"Newton_et_al_2013.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__1a\/81\/c2\/1a81c25350671666e57831e2ced0fe1bb7121235","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5527e6ade4b026915857c8bc?f=__disk__1a%2F81%2Fc2%2F1a81c25350671666e57831e2ced0fe1bb7121235"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5527e6ade4b026915857c8bc","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"WaterandSedimen.zip","files":""}],"csc":"NCCWSC","parent_id":"5050cb0ee4b0be20bb30eac0","people":["Teresa Newton","Jennifer S Sauer","Byron Karns"]},"542c29bbe4b0abfb4c8099a1":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/4f833c44e4b0e84f608680c6","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Water Temperature Profiles from CHARM for Lake Huron","relatedTitle":"Forecasting Climate Change Induced Effects on Recreational and Commercial Fish Populations in the Great Lakes","id":"542c29bbe4b0abfb4c8099a1","relatedId":"4f833c44e4b0e84f608680c6","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/542c29bbe4b0abfb4c8099a1","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Forecasting Climate Change Induced Effects on Recreational and Commercial Fish Populations in the Great Lakes","relatedTitle":"Water Temperature Profiles from CHARM for Lake Huron","id":"4f833c44e4b0e84f608680c6","relatedId":"542c29bbe4b0abfb4c8099a1","annotation":null}]},"id":"542c29bbe4b0abfb4c8099a1","title":"Water Temperature Profiles from CHARM for Lake Huron","body":"A Coupled Hydrosphere Atmosphere Research Model was developed that predicted vertical water temperature profiles, ice cover, and precipitation within 40-km grids and lake levels for Lakes Huron between 2058 and 2066.

As sea level rises, changes in relative elevation of the marsh plain will have differing impacts on the availability of habitat for marsh obligate species. The Wetland Accretion Rate Model for Ecosystem Resilience (WARMER) is a 1-D model of elevation that incorporates both biological and physical processes of vertical marsh accretion. Here, we use WARMER to evaluate changes in marsh surface elevation and the impact of these elevation changes on marsh habitat for specific species of concern. Model results were compared to elevation-based habitat criteria developed for marsh vegetation, the endangered California clapper rail ( \n<em>Rallus longirostris obsoletus<\/em>), and the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse ( \n<em>Reithrodontomys raviventris<\/em>) to determine the response of marsh habitat for each species to predicted &gt;1-m sea-level rise by 2100. Feedback between vertical accretion mechanisms and elevation reduced the effect of initial elevation in the modeled scenarios. Elevation decreased nonlinearly with larger changes in elevation during the latter half of the century when the rate of sea-level rise increased. Model scenarios indicated that changes in elevation will degrade habitat quality within salt marshes in the San Francisco Estuary, and degradation will accelerate in the latter half of the century as the rate of sea-level rise accelerates. A sensitivity analysis of the model results showed that inorganic sediment accumulation and the rate of sea-level rise had the greatest influence over salt marsh sustainability.","parentId":"50782a12e4b0df5513bf60f9","contacts":[{"name":"Springer US","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Kathleen M.

However, most of these seabird colonies are on low-elevation islands and sea-level rise (SLR) and accompanying high-water perturbations are predicted to escalate with climate change. To understand how SLR may impact protected islands and insular biodiversity, we modeled inundation and wave-driven flooding of a globally important seabird rookery in the subtropical Pacific. We acquired new high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and used the Delft3D wave model and ArcGIS to model wave heights and inundation for a range of SLR scenarios (+0.5, +1.0, +1.5, and +2.0 m) at Midway Atoll. Next, we classified vegetation to delineate habitat exposure to inundation and identified how breeding phenology, colony synchrony, and life history traits affect species-specific sensitivity. We identified 3 of 13 species as highly vulnerable to SLR in the Hawaiian Islands and quantified their atoll-wide distribution (Laysan albatross,&nbsp;<\/span><i>Phoebastria immutabilis<\/i><span>; black-footed albatross,&nbsp;<\/span><i>P<\/i><span>.&nbsp;<\/span><i>nigripes<\/i><span>; and Bonin petrel,&nbsp;<\/span><i>Pterodroma hypoleuca<\/i><span>). Our models of wave-driven flooding forecast nest losses up to 10% greater than passive inundation models at +1.0 m SLR. At projections of + 2.0 m SLR, approximately 60% of albatross and 44% of Bonin petrel nests were overwashed displacing more than 616,400 breeding albatrosses and petrels. Habitat loss due to passive SLR may decrease the carrying capacity of some islands to support seabird colonies, while sudden high-water events directly reduce survival and reproduction. This is the first study to simulate wave-driven flooding and the combined impacts of SLR, groundwater rise, and storm waves on seabird colonies. Our results highlight the need for early climate change planning and restoration of higher elevation seabird refugia to prevent low-lying protected islands from becoming ecological traps in the face of rising sea levels.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5074818fe4b090654e7b292e"],"contacts":[{"name":"Michelle H.

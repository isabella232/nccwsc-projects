Climate change effects such as sea-level rise and increased storms are altering these habitats, but we don\u2019t know how they are being affected or will change in the future. Our study will examine the links among these habitats and expected future changes at several sites along the California coast. We will look at the current weather patterns, bottom elevations, tidal range, and sediment of these connected habitats to see how they affect plants and animals, as well as to project how climate change may alter that balance.

Nonetheless humidity is not available in some widely-used archives of statistically downscaled climate projections for the western U.S. In this work the Localized Constructed Analogs (LOCA) statistical downscaling method is used to downscale specific humidity to a 1\u00b0\/16\u00b0 grid over the conterminous U.S. and the results compared to observations. LOCA reproduces observed monthly climatological values with a mean error of ~0.5&nbsp;% and RMS error of ~2&nbsp;%. Extreme (1-day in 1- and 20-years) maximum values (relevant to human health and energy demand) are within ~5&nbsp;% of observed, while extreme minimum values (relevant to agriculture and wildfire) are within ~15&nbsp;%. The asymmetry between extreme maximum and minimum errors is largely due to residual errors in the bias correction of extreme minimum...","type":["Publication"],"parent_id":"4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e"},"122":{"id":"57a5aaa0e4b0ebae89b6db09","fy":"Unknown","title":"Effects of climate change on tidal marshes along a latitudinal gradient in California","authors":["Karen M.

Tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays within coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats, and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise (SLR) are altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50\u2013100 years. Our study examined the projected effects of three recent SLR scenarios produced for the West Coast of North America on tidal marshes in California. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, plant composition, and sediment accretion to project how SLR may alter these ecosystems in the future. The goal of our research was to provide results that support coastal management and conservation efforts across California.

In the face of a changing climate, it is important that resource managers understand how factors such as changing temperatures and precipitation will affect this vital water source.\n\nTo address this need, researchers are examining records of streamflow, temperature, soil moisture, and precipitation in the upper Colorado River basin going back more than 100 years, to see how these variables have changed during periods of low flow and drought.

To address this immediate need, researchers are examining whether a common forest management tool, prescribed fire, can be implemented to help forests better survive drought.\n&nbsp;\nPrescribed fire is commonly used in the western U.S. to remove potential wildfire fuel, such as small trees and shrubs.

While rising temperatures can create drought conditions that favor severe fires, it is also possible that drought limits the ability of trees to survive a fire. During a drought, there is less water available for trees and more outbreaks of harmful insects and pathogens can occur, both of which can weaken trees. Tree mortality is one means of measuring the severity of a fire, and evidence shows that trees exposed to drought conditions for periods of 5-10 years are already more sensitive to the effects of fire \u2013 suggesting that drought could indeed increase fire severity.\n&nbsp;\nThis project will examine the poorly understood relationship between drought, fire, and tree mortality in the Southwest.

This project will examine how hydrologic systems in the Southwestern U.S. respond to climate changes and how this response depends both on the frequency of the changes and the properties of the system. Existing hydrologic models of the Upper San Pedro Basin and the Upper and Middle Verde watersheds will be used with global climate models to simulate and project causes and impacts of climate change. An improved understanding of the vulnerability of hydrologic and riparian areas to future climate will inform managers about which systems may be most sensitive to trends and periodic variations in climate.","type":["Data","Project"],"parent_id":"4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e"},"161":{"id":"54aed301e4b0d12d40fd53c3","fy":"Unknown","title":"Multiple sources of uncertainty affect metrics for ranking conservation risk under climate change","authors":["Amber Wright","Robert Hijmans","Mark Schwartz","H.

In the western United States, vast areas of public land, including those administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), present substantial conservation opportunities. For 11 contiguous western states, we used a novel multiple-criteria analysis to model and map contiguous areas of roadless BLM land that possessed important ecological indicators of high biodiversity, resilience to climate change, and landscape connectivity. Specifically, we leveraged available spatial datasets to implement a systematic and statistically robust analysis of seven key indicators at three different spatial scales, and to identify the locations of potential conservation priority areas (CPAs) across 294,274&nbsp;km2 &nbsp;of roadless BLM land.

The salt marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of this boundary region are connected habitats critical to sustaining wildlife and other resources. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise and increased storms are altering these habitats, but we don\u2019t know how they are being affected or will change in the future. Our study will examine the links among these habitats and expected future changes at several sites along the California coast. We will look at the current weather patterns, bottom elevations, tidal range, and sediment of these connected habitats to see how they affect plants and animals, as well as to project how climate change may alter that balance. The goal of our project is to provide scientific information to support future planning and conservation of nearshore natural resources as our climate changes. <\/div>","parentId":"531dd8c3e4b04cb293ee78ee","linkParentIds":["560046e7e4b05d6c4e50459f"],"contacts":[{"name":"Glen MacDonald","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"macdonal@geog.ucla.edu","organization":{"displayText":"UCLA"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"310-825-5008","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"90095","country":"USA","city":"Los Angeles","state":"CA","line1":"UCLA 405 Hilgard Ave."}}},{"name":"Southwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Karen M Thorne","oldPartyId":13502,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"kthorne@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Ecologist (Landscape)","firstName":"Karen","middleName":"M","lastName":"Thorne","organization":{"displayText":"Western Ecological Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"7075622005","officePhone":"7075623003","streetAddress":{"zip":"94592","country":"US","city":"Vallejo","state":"CA","line1":"505 Azuar Drive"},"buildingCode":"WBW","name":"Karen M Thorne\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"95819","country":"USA","city":"Sacramento","state":"CA","line1":"Modoc Hall, USGS, 3020 State University Drive East"},"building":"SF BAY FLD STATION IN KIND - BLDG 505 MAIN OFC TRLR"}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Southwest CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"},{"name":"Nearshore Ecosystems"},{"name":"Sea level rise"},{"name":"extreme storm events"},{"name":"California"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-09-01","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2017-08-31","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-01-02T12:21:47.158-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-23T09:16:02.182-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Technical Summary","value":"Over the past two years, the U. S. Geological Survey, University of California at Los Angeles, and Oregon State University have developed a multidisciplinary team with support from the Southwest CSC to develop a program entitled \u201cCoastal Ecosystem Response to Climate Change (CERCC).\u201d  The focus of CERCC is to engage natural resource managers at coastal sites and provide them with the scientific foundation for developing \u201cbottom-up\u201d climate change understanding and adaptation at local and regional scales.  Our initial work developed baseline datasets (1-cm-accuracy digital elevation models, tidal range loggers, coordinated plant surveys, and sediment studies) for a network of 18 sites along a latitudinal gradient along the Pacific coast in the continental U. S.  The project was developed in consultation with the California and North Pacific LCCs, and recently, both LCCs included us in their initiatives and provided funding to undertake climate \u201croadshows\u201d to conduct local coastal workshops and increase outreach efforts with local partners.  In this Statement of Intent, we propose to continue baseline studies across a coastal site network and integrate process-based, experimental studies at selected sites.\r\n\r\nChanging ocean and atmospheric conditions leading to sea-level rise and increased extreme storm events are reshaping nearshore coastal ecosystems and their local food webs.  The sustainability of mud flats and tidal marshes relies on allochthonous suspended sediment availability from the nearshore and runoff from snowmelt and precipitation as well as autochthonous organic matter production from plants.  Efforts to anticipate coastal ecosystem change have largely relied on global or regional scale data which may not be representative of local sites.  In taking a local site network approach (www.werc.usgs.gov\/SFBaySLR), we integrate data from multiple disciplines into empirical models describing current and future conditions and projected response of nearshore habitats.  In addition, our network allows us to capture habitat responses to storm events such as atmospheric rivers that affect the California coast.  We propose to leverage ongoing efforts including downscaled projections and storm modeling (Hall, Barnard, Holmquist, Brown), habitat characterization and risks (Thorne, Buffington, Dugger, De La Cruz), sediment studies (Ganju, Ambrose, Brown, Holmquist), and accretion processes (Guntenspergen, Thorne).  \r\n\r\nOur objectives include extensive studies across all California network sites and intensive studies at two selected sites.  Extensive studies include: 1) work with CERCC network site managers to continue quarterly tidal meter (water level, salinity, temp) and Surface Elevation Tables (SETs) readings to capture storm events such as atmospheric rivers; 2) augment the Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) at fine resolution (10s of meters) developing a coastal change module including flooding and erosion; and 3) integrate findings for an agent-based, decision simulation model (Envision) developed with LCC support.  At intensive studies (Seal Beach, s. CA, Mediterranean climate; Humboldt Bay, n. CA, Oceanic climate), we will examine: 4) site-specific community response to inundation by growing plants at different elevations in marsh organs, belowground production with in-growth bags, decomposition rates, and soil salinity; 5) sediment flux measurements augmented by an array of water samplers to determine spatial patterns of suspended sediment concentrations over the marsh on 4 high tides to apply to a spatially-explicit accretion model; and 6) sedimentational, palynological, plant macrofossil, and malacological records from sediment cores (14C, 210Pb, or Cs chronologies) related to past hydrological disturbances and storms (compared with Obj. 4), long-term resilience of marsh vegetation, a surface sampling grid to reconstruct 3-D changes in marsh sedimentation including storms and channel evulsions to assess marsh topographic stability (linked to Obj. 5) where records from retrospective core studies will be correlated with intermediate climate variability (ENSO, PDO, Little Ice-Age, Medieval Climate Anomaly), storms, and tectonic changes.  \r\n\r\n"},{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"FY 14 Grant ($117,925)","value":"G14AP00178"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":197575,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2014","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":117925},{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":79650}]}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=52c5bc4be4b05415ea491452&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=52c5bc4be4b05415ea491452&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=52c5bc4be4b05415ea491452&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=52c5bc4be4b05415ea491452","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/52c5bc4be4b05415ea491452\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""}],"realParentId":"4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e","csc":"Southwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Glen MacDonald","Karen M Thorne"],"orgs":["Southwest CSC"],"funding_years":"2014","fy":"2014"},"55957468e4b03ae2f4dbebea":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5012a629e4b05140039e02cd","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"A Hybrid Dynamical\u2013Statistical Downscaling Technique.

This technique combines the ability of dynamical downscaling to capture finescale dynamics with the computational savings of a statistical model to downscale multiple GCMs. First, dynamical downscaling is applied to five GCMs. Guided by an understanding of the underlying local dynamics, a simple statistical model is built relating the GCM input and the dynamically downscaled output. This statistical model is used to approximate the warming patterns of the remaining GCMs, as if they had been dynamically downscaled. The full 32-member ensemble allows for robust estimates of the most likely warming and uncertainty resulting from intermodel differences. The warming averaged over the region has an ensemble mean of 2.3&deg;C, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 1.0&deg; to 3.6&deg;C. Inland and high elevation areas warm more than coastal areas year round, and by as much as 60% in the summer months. A comparison to other common statistical downscaling techniques shows that the hybrid method produces similar regional-mean warming outcomes but demonstrates considerable improvement in capturing the spatial details. Additionally, this hybrid technique incorporates an understanding of the physical mechanisms shaping the region\u2019s warming patterns, enhancing the credibility of the final results.","parentId":"50475a83e4b067bd38f7f487","contacts":[{"name":"Daniel B.

Two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are considered, corresponding to greenhouse gas emission reductions over coming decades (RCP2.6) and to continued twenty-first-century emissions increases (RCP8.5). All available global climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are downscaled to provide likelihood and uncertainty estimates. By the end of century under RCP8.5, a distinctly new regional climate state emerges: average temperatures will almost certainly be outside the interannual variability range seen in the baseline. Except for the highest elevations and a narrow swath very near the coast, land locations will likely see 60\u201390 additional extremely hot days per year, effectively adding a new season of extreme heat. In mountainous areas, a majority of the many baseline days with freezing nighttime temperatures will most likely not occur. According to a similarity metric that measures daily temperature variability and the climate change signal, the RCP8.5 end-of-century climate will most likely be only about 50% similar to the baseline. For midcentury under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 and end of century under RCP2.6, these same measures also indicate a detectable though less significant climatic shift. Therefore, while measures reducing global emissions would not prevent climate change at this regional scale in the coming decades, their impact would be dramatic by the end of the twenty-first century.","parentId":"50475a83e4b067bd38f7f487","contacts":[{"name":"Fengpeng Sun","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of California"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Daniel B.

The screening method is based on an analytical solution for the damping of sinusoidal infiltration variations in homogeneous soils in the vadose zone. The damping depth is defined as the depth at which the flux variation damps to 5% of the variation at the land surface. Groundwater recharge may be considered steady where the damping depth is above the depth of the water table. The analytical solution approximates the vadose zone diffusivity as constant, and we evaluated when this approximation is reasonable. We evaluated the analytical solution through comparison of the damping depth computed by the analytic solution with the damping depth simulated by a numerical model that allows variable diffusivity. This comparison showed that the screening method conservatively identifies areas of steady recharge and is more accurate when water content and diffusivity are nearly constant. Nomograms of the damping factor (the ratio of the flux amplitude at any depth to the amplitude at the land surface) and the damping depth were constructed for clay and sand for periodic variations between 1 and 365 d and flux means and amplitudes from nearly 0 to 1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123<\/sup> m d<sup>\u22121<\/sup>.

We used ecological niche models to compare predicted climatic habitat suitability for 132 species of reptiles and amphibians in California, USA under the previous and current generations of climate simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5). We used data from seven global climate models for future (2014\u20132060) predictions under the following greenhouse gas emissions scenarios: SRES A2 for CMIP3 and RCP 8.5 for CMIP5. Ensembles of these climate models predicted a warmer and slightly wetter future California on average: CMIP3&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;\u00b0C mean annual temperature, +15&nbsp;mm annual precipitation, CMIP5&nbsp;+&nbsp;2.5&nbsp;\u00b0C mean annual temperature, +24&nbsp;mm annual precipitation. CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles differed in where precipitation changes were predicted to be largest, with CMIP3 predicting greatest increased precipitation in the northern deserts and CMIP5 predicting greatest increased precipitation in the northern mountains. Under both sets of climate models (CMIP3 and CMIP5), mean habitat suitability within species ranges was predicted to decrease in the future. The degree of predicted decline was similar on average for CMIP3 and CMIP5, \u221215&nbsp;% and \u221213&nbsp;% respectively, suggesting that conclusions drawn from previous studies using ensembles of CMIP3 models are robust, at least for California. However, the effect of CMIP3 vs. CMIP5 on future mean habitat suitability depended strongly on which GCM was used: three GCMs predicted little change in future habitat suitability between CMIP3 and CMIP5 (MIROC, CNRM, GFDL), three predicted greater reductions in habitat suitability under CMIP3 (MPI, GISS, IPSL), and one predicted greater reductions in habitat suitability under CMIP5 (MRI). We conclude that habitat suitability assessments under CMIP3 made using more than 3 GCMs are likely to remain broadly applicable, while those made using 3 or fewer may be conservation priorities for re-evaluation under CMIP5.","parentId":"502bdd9be4b098307cc38b6f","contacts":[{"name":"Springer Netherlands","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Amber N.

Those studying or planning to adapt to future climate impacts demand downscaled climate model output for local or regional use. The archive we describe attempts to fulfill this need by providing data in several formats, selectable to meet user needs. Our archive has served as a resource for climate impacts modelers, water managers, educators, and others. Over 1,400 individuals have transferred more than 50 TB of data from the archive. In response to user demands, the archive has expanded from monthly downscaled data to include daily data to facilitate investigations of phenomena sensitive to daily to monthly temperature and precipitation, including extremes in these quantities. New developments include downscaled output from the new Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model simulations at both the monthly and daily time scales, as well as simulations of surface hydrologi- cal variables. The web interface allows the extraction of individual projections or ensemble statistics for user-defined regions, promoting the rapid assessment of model consensus and uncertainty for future projections of precipitation, temperature, and hydrology.","parentId":"50475a83e4b067bd38f7f487","contacts":[{"name":"E.

A primary question among stakeholders is whether low precipitation in certain months is a harbinger of annual drought in California. Historical precipitation data from 1895 to 2013 are investigated to identify leading monthly indicators of annual drought in each of the seven climate divisions (CDs) as well as statewide. For this study, drought conditions are defined as monthly\/annual (October\u2013September) precipitation below the 20th\/30th percentile, and a leading indicator is defined as a monthly drought preceding or during an annual drought that has the strongest association (i.e., joint probability of occurrence) with a statewide annual drought. Monthly precipitation variability and contributions to annual precipitation, along with joint probabilities of drought among the winter months, are first analyzed. Then the probabilities of annual drought and the variability in leading indicators are analyzed according to different climate phases and CDs. This study identified December within a water year as being the leading indicator that is most frequently associated with annual drought statewide (56%) and in most of the CDs (the highest was CD2 at 65%). Associated with its leading-indicator status, December drought was most frequently associated with drought in other winter months (joint probability &gt; 30%). Results from this study can help stakeholders to understand and assess the likelihood of annual drought events given monthly precipitation preceding or early in the water year.","parentId":"544e94bee4b0240906891311","contacts":[{"name":"Shraddhanand Shukla","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of California"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Anne Steinemann","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Melbourne","directoryId":"64383"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Sam F.

In this case study, we demonstrate a novel approach to examining extreme winter storm and flood risks. We incorporated high-resolution atmospheric\u2013hydrologic modeling of the ARkStorm extreme winter storm scenario with multiple modes of engagement with practitioners, including a series of facilitated discussions and a tabletop emergency management exercise, to develop a regional assessment of extreme storm vulnerabilities, mitigation options, and science needs in the greater Lake Tahoe region of Northern Nevada and California, USA. Through this process, practitioners discussed issues of concern across all phases of the emergency management life cycle, including preparation, response, recovery, and mitigation. Interruption of transportation, communications, and interagency coordination were among the most pressing concerns, and specific approaches for addressing these issues were identified, including prepositioning resources, diversifying communications systems, and improving coordination among state, tribal, and public utility practitioners. Science needs included expanding real-time monitoring capabilities to improve the precision of meteorological models and enhance situational awareness, assessing vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure, and conducting cost\u2013benefit analyses to assess opportunities to improve both natural and human-made infrastructure to better withstand extreme storms. Our approach and results can be used to support both land use and emergency planning activities aimed toward increasing community resilience to extreme winter storm hazards in mountainous regions.","parentId":"544e953be4b0240906891329","contacts":[{"name":"Springer Netherlands","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Christine M.

Many Mediterranean-climate salt marshes along southern California, USA coast import sediment during El Ni\u00f1o storm events, but sediment fluxes and mechanisms during dry weather are potentially important for marsh stability. We calculated tidal creek sediment fluxes within a highly modified, sediment-starved, 1.5-km<sup>2<\/sup> salt marsh (Seal Beach) and a less modified 1-km<sup>2<\/sup>marsh (Mugu) with fluvial sediment supply. We measured salt marsh plain suspended sediment concentration and vertical accretion using single stage samplers and marker horizons. At Seal Beach, a 2014 storm yielded 39 and 28&nbsp;g\/s mean sediment fluxes and imported 12,000 and 8800&nbsp;kg in a western and eastern channel. Western channel storm imports offset 8700&nbsp;kg exported during 2&nbsp;months of dry weather, while eastern channel storm imports augmented 9200&nbsp;kg imported during dry weather. During the storm at Mugu, suspended sediment concentrations on the marsh plain increased by a factor of four; accretion was 1\u20132&nbsp;mm near creek levees. An exceptionally high tide sequence yielded 4.4&nbsp;g\/s mean sediment flux, importing 1700&nbsp;kg: 20&nbsp;% of Mugu\u2019s dry weather fluxes. Overall, low sediment fluxes were observed, suggesting that these salt marshes are geomorphically stable during dry weather conditions. Results suggest storms and high lunar tides may play large roles, importing sediment and maintaining dry weather sediment flux balances for southern California salt marshes. However, under future climate change and sea level rise scenarios, results suggest that balanced sediment fluxes lead to marsh elevational instability based on estimated mineral sediment deficits.<\/p><div><br><\/div>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50475751e4b067bd38f7f460"],"contacts":[{"name":"Jordan A.

This relationship with both land and water ecosystems makes indigenous people and cultures particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

These investments leverage funding provided by the Southwest Climate Science Center, the Agnese Nelms Haury Program in Environment and Social Justice, the Desert Landscape Conservation Cooperative and the UA Institute of the Environment. We are also starting to engage with another important UA partner, the Native Nations Institute for Leadership, Management and Policy (NNI) at the Udall Center for Studies in Public Policy, which promises an opportunity to leverage these efforts through tribal governance, outreach, training, and capacity-building.\n \nThis new phase of our partnership will expand our capacity to work directly with tribes and scale-up our efforts to meet the needs of additional tribal partners.  We focus in particular on expansion of our technical capacity to support on the ground adaptation efforts that will help with tribal engagement, grant writing, access to relevant climate information, and overcoming a range of existing governance barriers and building trust to design and implement on-the-ground climate adaptation strategies.

Native Americans have a deep connection to the natural environment within which their livelihoods, cultural identity, and spiritual practices are rooted. Changes to hydrologic regimes, landscapes, and ecosystems, in combination with socio-economic and political factors, amplify tribal vulnerabilities to climate change. In the Southwest, tribes are already experiencing a range of impacts that are at least partially related to climate change. They include serious water supply and water quality issues in the context of prolonged drought; loss of ecosystem services and reduced ability to grow or collect important traditional crops and raw materials; increased impacts to forest resources from large and landscape-transforming wildfires due to drought, aridity, and insect infestations; health impacts from heat waves, dust storms, and smoke from wildfires; and the potential spread of infectious diseases from geographic shifts in disease vectors. The remoteness of many villages also compounds difficulties in aiding tribal members during extreme weather events such as floods and heat waves, leading to over-stressed emergency management systems. The aim of this project is to help develop a partnership that leverages previously existing and newly developing tribal engagement capacity within the Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions (CCASS) and identifies emergent opportunities now possible with enhanced investment. Ultimately, a SW CSC-LCC-CCASS partnership will support achieving a suite of shared objectives in the near and longer-term. CCASS will expand the current work of the SW CSC and build on prior investments of the University of Arizona-based and NOAA-funded Climate Assessment for the Southwest (CLIMAS), while building the programs and services of the CCASS\/Haury Native Nations Climate Adaptation Program.","parentId":"55130c96e4b02e76d75c075e","contacts":[{"name":"Katharine Jacobs","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Arizona"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Southwest CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2015"},{"name":"Tribal"},{"name":"Capacity Building"},{"name":"Adaptation"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2015-09-15","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2016-09-14","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-10-15T07:18:49.093-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-30T14:19:49.823-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Number","value":"G15AP00172"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Type","value":"Grant"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":100445,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":100445}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":912,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-09-13T21:57:39.000Z","title":"Great Basin Sunflower Flats -

Land managers, as they work to develop robust climate change adaptation strategies, are keen to buy time by enhancing forest resistance (sensu Walker et al. 2004) to such abrupt, severe, and widespread changes. Reductions in tree density following thinning (from mechanical treatments, prescribed fire, or both) have been widely presumed to increase resistance to drought. Yet this proposition has remained largely untested, meaning land managers do not have the basic information they need for critical cost-benefit analyses. \r\nProcedures\/Methods: Capitalizing on existing long-term forest monitoring datasets, detailed physiological measurements, experimental plots and a variety of remotely sensed imagery, we will assess stand conditions created by recent forest management with conditions in untreated areas to assess whether and to what extent thinning promotes resistance to the current severe drought. Specifically, we will relate field-based forest metrics including demographic structure, abundance, size and species of trees, level of dieback, and potentially physiological measurements to remotely sensed indices of drought, including aerial mapping of forest dieback, MODIS NDII, Landsat time series, and hyperspectral data. We will use GIS to integrate the various data types through a stratification of the landscape that identifies what forest applications have been done where, and what remote sensing datasets are available at which locations. The results from such a framework can also be used to make predictive estimates of future forest conditions by leveraging rasterized projections of future landscape hydrological conditions, which can be assessed for the future times at which the San Joaquin will experience droughts similar to the current one.\r\nExpected Products and Information\/Technology Transfer: We will engage managers at all phases of project development and execution. Currently we have enlisted the support of key land managers in the region, and received commitments for data sharing and assistance with project scoping and technology translation. \r\nPersonnel\/Cooperators\/Partners: Our research team has extensive publication records in top journals in the fields of climate change impacts, fire science, forest ecology and remote sensing. Much of our work has focused on understanding climate change impacts on forest ecosystems and possible management responses. \r\n"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"}],"files":[{"imageWidth":2046,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-10-31T18:54:11.000Z","title":"Fire in the Sierra National Forest, CA - Credit: USFS","imageHeight":1534,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/561ff941e4b03ee62faa90f8?f=__disk__4b%2F83%2F74%2F4b8374419a0451d1239b2fe654a406c295be032d","processed":false,"size":395068,"useForPreview":true,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"cc2186eeb34cd62199cdd1117ff26f42"},"name":"Fire_SierraNationalForest_CA_USFS.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__4b\/83\/74\/4b8374419a0451d1239b2fe654a406c295be032d","contentType":"image\/jpeg"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=561ff941e4b03ee62faa90f8&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=561ff941e4b03ee62faa90f8&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=561ff941e4b03ee62faa90f8&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=561ff941e4b03ee62faa90f8","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/561ff941e4b03ee62faa90f8\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/561ff941e4b03ee62faa90f8","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"CanPrescribedFi.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Southwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["James Thorne","Phillip van Mantgem","Carlos Ramirez","Susan Ustin","Mark Schwartz","Hugh Safford","Adrian Das","Anthony Ambrose"],"orgs":["Southwest CSC"],"funding_years":"2015","fy":"2015"},"5745b07be4b07e28b662c595":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5012a99be4b05140039e02e5","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Chief - Final Report - SW Project Climate Change Vulnerability of Native Americans in the Southwest","relatedTitle":"Climate Change Vulnerability of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe in the Southwest","id":"5745b07be4b07e28b662c595","relatedId":"5012a99be4b05140039e02e5","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5745b07be4b07e28b662c595","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Climate Change Vulnerability of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe in the Southwest","relatedTitle":"Chief - Final Report - SW Project Climate Change Vulnerability of Native Americans in the Southwest","id":"5012a99be4b05140039e02e5","relatedId":"5745b07be4b07e28b662c595","annotation":null}]},"id":"5745b07be4b07e28b662c595","title":"Chief - Final Report - SW Project Climate Change Vulnerability of Native Americans in the Southwest","body":"Native Americans in the Southwest United States are thought to be particularly vulnerable to climate change.

Recent studies have shown that more than 60% of heavy cool season precipitation events (Nov-Mar) in the Verde River basin in northeastern Arizona, are related to the occurrence of Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) (Rivera, 2014). ARs are narrow corridors of concentrated water vapor that bring copious amount of rainfall along the U.S. west coast (Dettinger et al., 2011; Neiman et al., 2008; Ralph et al., 2013; Ralph and Dettinger, 2012; Ralph et al., 2006; Rutz et al., 2014) and penetrate inland where they interact with the topography to produce heavy precipitation and flooding (Neiman et al., 2013; Rivera, 2014). Additionally, the arrival of ARs can contribute to the end of persistent droughts in the west coast (Dettinger, 2013). The Salt and Verde basins provide most of the water supply for the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, the 12th largest in the USA, and for two tribal reservations: the White Mountain Apache tribe and the San Carlos Apache tribe which jointly own 59.4% of the land. While current drier-than-normal atmospheric conditions have increased forest fire risk and have put more pressure on the available water for human and ecosystem consumption; near and mid-term (months to decades) precipitation projections are of great concern to natural-resource managers who depend on the basins\u2019 resources for water supply, ecosystem health, and economic activities such as timber, carbon credit projects, wildlife and recreational enterprises. Intense precipitation events can cause flooding which results in turbid water that is untreatable and damages the recharge facilities, this creates difficulties for water managers in the region (Doug Toy, pers. comm.).\r\n \r\nThe objectives of the proposed research, responding to Science Priorities 1 and 2, are: 1) Analyze the predictability of ARs at intermediate timescales (10 years) using decadal climate model simulations by identifying the large scale-atmospheric circulation patterns associated to ARs. Are ARs modulated by ENSO events? Are ARs likely to become more frequent and intense under warmer climates? 2) Develop and apply hydrological models to simulate streamflows in the basins for water management (e.g., reservoir levels and releases) and for flood control purposes. How is the frequency and intensity of ARs linked to drought periods in the basin? \r\n\r\nWe plan to use an automated AR detection algorithm (Rivera and Dominguez, in preparation) to identify ARs affecting the Salt-Verde basin in the decadal climate simulations from the CMIP5 experiment. These simulations are initialized with observed sea surface temperatures every 5 years (1960, 1965,\u2026,2005) and run 10 years into the future and could potentially yield a better representation of ocean-atmosphere procesess (Meehl et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2012). We will evaluate the predictability of ARs based on changes in the location of Pacific jet stream linked to ENSO events which results in wetter than normal winters (Canon et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2006). It is important to keep in mind that the intensity and spatial extent of precipitation linked to ARs is due to the interaction of the atmospheric moisture with the local topography, however, the CMIP5 GCMs are still too coarse to realistically represent these fine-scale processes. We will obtain a detailed representation of the projected precipitation in the basin, by dynamically downscaling individual AR events using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Regional Climate Model for both the historical and projected future climates.\r\nWhile understanding the precipitation response to AR events is important, this information is not particularly useful to stakeholders who are primarily concerned with the impact of precipitation events on runoff in the reservoirs. Consequently, most of our efforts will be focused on analyzing the hydrologic response of the Salt and Verde basins to AR events. We will use both observed and simulated historical and future precipitation to drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model. The model will provide information on streamflow in the Salt and Verde, as well as soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and other hydrologic variables through the basin. We will simulate event-driven daily streamflows along the main channels placing particular attention to the role of antecedent moisture conditions in the basin on flooding. Since extreme wet events cause flooding that results in untreatable turbid waters, we will analyze how often water quality issues are associated to an AR occurrence. Flooding along the main channels will also be simulated with the Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System model (HEC-RAS) for maximum daily simulated flows.

tribal water resources and the subsequent cascading effects on the livelihoods and cultures of American Indians and Alaska Natives living on tribal lands in the U.S. A hazards and vulnerability framework for understanding these impacts is first presented followed by context on the framework components, including climate, hydrologic, and ecosystem changes (i.e. hazards) and tribe-specific vulnerability factors (socioeconomic, political, infrastructural, environmental, spiritual and cultural), which when combined with hazards lead to impacts. Next regional summaries of impacts around the U.S. are discussed. Although each tribal community experiences unique sets of impacts because of their individual history, culture, and geographic setting, many of the observed impacts are common among different groups and can be categorized as impacts on\u20141) water supply and management (including water sources and infrastructure), 2) aquatic species important for culture and subsistence, 3) ranching and agriculture particularly from climate extremes (e.g., droughts, floods), 4) tribal sovereignty and rights associated with water resources, fishing, hunting, and gathering, and 5) soil quality (e.g., from coastal and riverine erosion prompting tribal relocation or from drought-related land degradation). The paper finishes by highlighting potentially relevant research questions based on the five impact categories.","parentId":"504763d9e4b067bd38f7f4be","contacts":[{"name":"Springer Netherlands","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"K.

Reduced water supplies as a consequence of climate change would result in a compounded reduction of inflows to Pyramid Lake, thus potentially impacting the spawning and sustenance of a cultural livelihood, the endangered cui-ui fish ( \n<em>Chasmistes cujus<\/em> ). Meanwhile, limited economic opportunities and dwindling federal support constrain tribal adaptive capacity.

In the Southwest, where the temperature and precipitation changes from climate change are expected to be particularly severe, tribal communities may be especially vulnerable. Through this project, researchers sought to better understand the climate change threats facing the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of northwestern Nevada. Researchers found that the Tribe\u2019s vulnerability to climate change stems from its dependence on Pyramid Lake, which may experience reduced water supply in the future. This will potentially have negative consequences for the endangered cui-ui fish, which is an important food and income source for the Tribe. At the same time, the Tribe is limited in its current ability to respond to climate impacts because of few economic opportunities and dwindling federal support. Researchers worked collaboratively with the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe to develop adaptation and water management strategies that will help the Tribe prepare for and respond to climate change impacts.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","purpose":"Native Americans in the Southwest United States are thought to be particularly vulnerable to climate change. Tribal resiliency to climate change can be affected by multiple climate-related threats and by tribal communities\u2019 close reliance on natural resources for sustenance, economic development, and maintenance of cultural traditions.  A scientifically rigorous assessment of such threats to Native Americans is a pressing need across southwestern landscapes.  This project examined factors affecting Native American tribes, including water rights for fish and wildlife, protection of wetlands, and enhancement and recovery of the Pyramid Lake, Nevada fishery, and protection of important fish species. This project aimed to help manage potential conflicts among stakeholders by providing a better understanding of system dynamics and climate projections in the region.

The proposed project contains both regional climate and hydrologic modeling components designed to retrospectively diagnose and project streamflow in the Colorado River sub-basins, accounting for both natural variability and anthropogenic climate change. Particularly, whether there will be a synergistic relationship between the occurrence of extreme wet or dry conditions and the natural variability of El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Variability (ENSO-PDV) is of high interest. The main objective of this project is to characterize how the changing climate of the Southwest is affecting cool and warm season precipitation in the Colorado River basin and the corresponding response of streamflow in individual sub-basins. The final project deliverable is a streamflow projection product, that better accounts for physical mechanisms of weather and climate on a regional and local scale, which can be directly used by water resource providers.&nbsp; <\/div>","parentId":"526ab86ae4b0be4db9fbf270","contacts":[{"name":"Hsin-I Chang","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"hchang@atmo.arizona.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Arizona"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"520-626-0358","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"85721","country":"USA","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","line1":"1118 E 4th st, Rm 542"}}},{"name":"Christopher Castro","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"castro@atmo.arizona.edu","cellPhone":"520- 626-5617","organization":{"displayText":"University of Arizona"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"520- 626-5617","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Peter Troch","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Arizona"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"James Prairie","oldPartyId":56333,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.","firstName":"James","lastName":"Prairie","organization":{"displayText":"Bureau of Reclamation"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jon A.

effects on meadows in Yosemite National Park, California","body":"<p>To assess how montane meadow vegetation recovered after a wildfire that occurred in Yosemite National Park, CA in 1996, Google Earth Engine image processing was applied to leverage the entire Landsat Thematic Mapper archive from 1985 to 2012. Vegetation greenness (normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) was summarized every 16 days across the 28-year Landsat time series for 26 meadows. Disturbance event detection was hindered by the subtle influence of low-severity fire on meadow vegetation. A hard break (August 1996) was identified corresponding to the Ackerson Fire, and monthly composites were used to compare NDVI values and NDVI trends within burned and unburned meadows before, immediately after, and continuously for more than a decade following the fire date. Results indicate that NDVI values were significantly lower at 95% confidence level for burned meadows following the fire date, yet not significantly lower at 95% confidence level in the unburned meadows. Burned meadows continued to exhibit lower monthly NDVI in the dormant season through 2012. Over the entire monitoring period, the negative-trending, dormant season NDVI slopes in the burned meadows were also significantly lower than unburned meadows at 90% confidence level. Lower than average NDVI values and slopes in the dormant season compared to unburned meadows, coupled with photographic evidence, strongly suggest that evergreen vegetation was removed from the periphery of some meadows after the fire.

Constructed Analogs (LOCA) over the conterminous United States","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00382-015-2845-1):&nbsp;Humidity is important to climate impacts in hydrology, agriculture, ecology, energy demand, and human health and comfort. Nonetheless humidity is not available in some widely-used archives of statistically downscaled climate projections for the western U.S. In this work the Localized Constructed Analogs (LOCA) statistical downscaling method is used to downscale specific humidity to a 1\u00b0\/16\u00b0 grid over the conterminous U.S. and the results compared to observations. LOCA reproduces observed monthly climatological values with a mean error of ~0.5&nbsp;% and RMS error of ~2&nbsp;%. Extreme (1-day in 1- and 20-years) maximum values (relevant to human health and energy demand) are within ~5&nbsp;% of observed, while extreme minimum values (relevant to agriculture and wildfire) are within ~15&nbsp;%. The asymmetry between extreme maximum and minimum errors is largely due to residual errors in the bias correction of extreme minimum values. The temporal standard deviations of downscaled daily specific humidity values have a mean error of ~1&nbsp;% and RMS error of ~3&nbsp;%. LOCA increases spatial coherence in the final downscaled field by ~13&nbsp;%, but the downscaled coherence depends on the spatial coherence in the data being downscaled, which is not addressed by bias correction. Temporal correlations between daily, monthly, and annual time series of the original and downscaled data typically yield values &gt;0.98. LOCA captures the observed correlations between temperature and specific humidity even when the two are downscaled independently.","parentId":"50475a83e4b067bd38f7f487","contacts":[{"name":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"David Pierce","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Scripps Institution of Oceanography"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Daniel R Cayan","oldPartyId":1669,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"drcayan@usgs.gov","jobTitle":"Oceanographer","firstName":"Daniel","middleName":"R","lastName":"Cayan","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Branch of Regional Research, Western Region"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8585348561","officePhone":"8585344507","streetAddress":{"zip":"92093","country":"US","city":"La Jolla","state":"CA","line1":"Scripps Inst.

Tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays within coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats, and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise (SLR) are altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50\u2013100 years. Our study examined the projected effects of three recent SLR scenarios produced for the West Coast of North America on tidal marshes in California. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, plant composition, and sediment accretion to project how SLR may alter these ecosystems in the future. The goal of our research was to provide results that support coastal management and conservation efforts across California. Under a low SLR scenario, all study sites remained vegetated tidal wetlands, with most sites showing little elevation and vegetation change relative to sea level. At most sites, mid SLR projections led to increases in low marsh habitat at the expense of middle and high marsh habitat. Marshes at Morro Bay and Tijuana River Estuary were the most vulnerable to mid SLR with many areas becoming intertidal mudflat. Under a high SLR scenario, most sites were projected to lose vegetated habitat, eventually converting to intertidal mudflats. Our results suggest that California marshes are vulnerable to major habitat shifts under mid or high rates of SLR, especially in the latter part of the century. Loss of vegetated tidal marshes in California due to SLR is expected to impact ecosystem services that are dependent on coastal wetlands such as wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration, improved water quality, and coastal protection from storms.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["544e9418e4b02409068912fc"],"contacts":[{"name":"Karen M.

Precipitation on Colorado River Water Resources: Reconstructing the Past to Understand the Future","body":"<div>Streamflow in the Colorado River is heavily influenced by high-elevation snowpack. Warming temperatures in spring can reduce snow-fed flows, with serious implications for the water supplies that support communities and wildlife. While it is already well-known that precipitation has a significant influence on river flow, recent observations suggest that temperature and the amount of water in soil may also influence streamflow. In the face of a changing climate, it is important that resource managers understand how factors such as changing temperatures and precipitation will affect this vital water source.<br>\n<br>\nTo address this need, researchers are examining records of streamflow, temperature, soil moisture, and precipitation in the upper Colorado River basin going back more than 100 years, to see how these variables have changed during periods of low flow and drought. Next, researchers will analyze tree rings to reconstruct climatic conditions over the past 1,000 years to see if more recent droughts differ from historical climate patterns. This information will help researchers determine if droughts are lasting longer or are more severe than historical droughts, improving our understanding of the impacts of climate change in the region.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nSo far, researchers have found that warming temperatures have played an increasingly important role over the past decades, both exacerbating droughts and dampening the effects of wet winters on high flows.&nbsp;The results of this study will help water managers assess the range of possible conditions that may be expected to occur in the future in the Colorado River basin, and help determine how warming temperatures may influence the river\u2019s flow and the region\u2019s water supply.<\/div>\n","purpose":"Snow-fed rivers of the western US are becoming especially vulnerable to warm springs which hasten the melting of snow. Research indicates that spring temperatures are increasingly contributing to low flows, along with dry winters, as temperatures have warmed over the past few decades. While winter precipitation (rain and snow) is very important to the water supplies that result from melting snow, we now know that temperatures in spring can also have an important impact on river flow and water supplies. Our records of river flow, temperatures, and winter precipitation are only about 100 years in length - too short to assess the range of temperature and moisture conditions that can impact river flow - so we turn to tree rings which can be used to reconstruct past climate conditions. Reconstructions of past climate allow us to assess the range of climate events, such as drought, that have occurred in the past, and that could occur in the future. These extended records also enable us to compare recent climate and projections of future climate in the context of the past to determine when conditions exceed the range of natural climate variability. In this study, we will use existing Colorado River streamflow and winter precipitation reconstructions for the past 1000 years, along with a new spring temperature record, developed under this study, to evaluate past droughts, many of which have far exceed the length and severity of droughts recorded in the gage record. These long records allow us to investigate the different combinations of temperatures and winter precipitation that have contributed to past droughts. Were major droughts just devastatingly dry or did warmer spring temperatures play a role? How do warm conditions that influenced past drought compare to the warming that is projected in the future? We will collaborate with water managers to help them determine how warming temperatures may influence river flow in the future.","parentId":"531dd8c3e4b04cb293ee78ee","contacts":[{"name":"Connie Woodhouse","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"conniew1@email.arizona.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Arizona"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"520-626-0235","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"85721","country":"USA","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","line1":"412 Harvill Building, Box #2\r\nUniversity of Arizona"}}},{"name":"Gregory Pederson","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"gpederson@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"4069947390","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"59715","country":"USA","city":"Bozeman","state":"MT","line1":"2327 University Way, Suite 2"}}},{"name":"Adam Csank","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"adamc@nipissingu.ca","organization":{"displayText":"Nipissing University"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"+1 (705) 474-3450 ext: 4023","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"P1B 8L7","country":"Canada","city":"North Bay","state":"Ontario","line1":"100 College Drive"}}},{"name":"Southwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Label","name":"Colorado River"},{"type":"Label","name":"Paleoclimate"},{"type":"Label","name":"drought"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Southwest CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-09-01","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2017-02-28","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-12-16T21:03:17.441-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-12-21T13:27:34.322-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Technical Summary","value":"Understanding and anticipating the joint impacts of cool-season precipitation and increasing spring temperatures on snowpack and runoff is critical for water resource management and planning in the 21st century. Recent research indicates that spring temperatures are becoming an increasingly important driver of post-1980s snowpack declines in the Southern Rockies. This research shows the combined influence of cool-season temperature and precipitation anomalies of the 20th century served to ameliorate or exacerbate decadal-scale drought\/pluvial events in a way that presents substantial, and different, water management challenges. Until now, disentangling the relative roles of temperature and precipitation in driving major decadal-scale departures in upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) water resources over past centuries has not been possible due a lack of a cool season temperature proxy. New results from NSF-funded work by the PIs shows it is now possible to obtain a record of winter\/spring temperatures in the UCRB using d18O derived from tree-ring cellulose in cool-season, moisture-sensitive trees. Independent precipitation reconstructions are also available. This project will build on these research results to develop a winter\/spring temperature record for the UCRB to assess periods of extreme, decadal-scale drought and pluvial events over the past 1000 years). The main goals of the study are as follows: 1) Examine the relative importance of spring temperatures and cool season precipitation on past drought and pluvial periods documented in the existing Colorado River reconstruction. 2) Evaluate how the magnitude of projected cool-season warming in CMIP-5 models compares to reconstructed spring warming during the most notable UCRB droughts.  3) Collaborate with water managers to determine key research questions concerning winter\/spring temperatures and Colorado River flow, and the best ways to incorporate this information into planning for a future. This proposal directly addresses the Southwest CSC scientific priority #3 Hydrological effects of climate change in the Southwest; and produces baseline data for priority#2, Linking climatic, hydrological and ecological changes at intermediate timescales.  It also addresses cross-cutting CSC program priorities including climate impacts on natural resources and engagement with decision makers. Though this project is designed for the UCRB, a similar approach could be used to develop temperature reconstructions where water supplies are dependent on snowpack (e.g. Rio Grande, Sacramento River).\r\n"},{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"FY 14 Grant ($118,024)","value":"G14AP00152"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":167774,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2014","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":118024},{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":49750}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":536,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":173802,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-03-14T13:56:03.000Z","name":"Colorado_River_at_Navajo_Bridge_nr_Lees_Ferry__AZ_06-27-2009_3-USGS.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__8f\/dc\/89\/8fdc897f2d247eb2681700b4e9af3c0ccde387ec","title":"Colorado River in Marble Canyon.

Hydrologic and ecological processes, such as groundwater fluctuations and riparian evapotranspiration, can be tightly coupled. Ideally, managers would have tools and models that include all processes to better understand how each management action would propagate through the environment. Because resources are limited, management tools that include only the most important processes may be more realistic. However, in some cases, omitting some interactions can lead to significant errors in predictions of hydrologic outcomes and ecological function, severely limiting a manager\u2019s ability to identify how restoration and conservation actions may make a system more resilient. Our goal is to develop a metric of hydrologic feedback strength for weighing the impact of conservation and restoration actions. We use modeling and feedbacks to quantify how hydrologic processes or restoration can amplify or absorb the effects of climate variability on riparian systems. Our framework also allows scientists to assess which processes are critical for hydrologic models to predict response to climate change. Using these index values, managers can predict which processes will amplify or absorb the potential effects of variable climate, climatic change, and proposed restoration actions.<\/div>\n","parentId":"55130c96e4b02e76d75c075e","contacts":[{"name":"Paul Ferre","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"tyferre@gmail.com","organization":{"displayText":"Hydrology and Water Resources, University of Arizona"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"520 621 2952","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"85721-0011","country":"USA","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","line1":"1133 E James E Rogers Way"}}},{"name":"Jesse Dickinson","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jdickins@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Hydrologic Investigations and Research Section"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"5206706671306","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"85719","country":"USA","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","line1":"520 N.

To address this immediate need, researchers are examining whether a common forest management tool, prescribed fire, can be implemented to help forests better survive drought.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nPrescribed fire is commonly used in the western U.S. to remove potential wildfire fuel, such as small trees and shrubs. It is also thought that this act of selectively removing some trees helps the remaining trees better survive drought events, because there is less competition for water. However, the proposition that prescribed burning could improve forest resistance to drought has never been formally tested. By comparing the survivorship of trees in burned and unburned forest monitoring plots in drought-impacted areas, researchers will determine (a) whether prescribed fire is an effective tool for improving forest resistance to drought, and (b) whether factors such as time since fire and tree species and size influence a forest\u2019s degree of resistance.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nIn the face of ongoing climate change and projected future drought conditions in the West, this study will help land managers make informed decisions on how to best allocate limited climate change adaptation funds. The results will help managers make cost-benefit analyses of dollars spent using prescribed fire and determine whether this method can be used to prepare forests for a drier future.<\/div>\n","purpose":"Prescribed fire is a primary tool used to restore southwestern forests following more than a century of fire exclusion. Prescribed fire reduces fire risk partly by removing small trees, shrubs, and surface litter; it is also assumed that following fire there is less competition among remaining trees so that they are more resistant (more likely to survive) in the face of additional stressors, such as drought. Yet this proposition remains untested, so that managers do not have the basic information they need for to evaluate whether prescribed fire actually achieves this objective. In the face of ongoing climatic changes, is a dollar best spent on increasing forest resistance using prescribed fire, or is it best spent on other climate change adaptation needs? The severe and on-going drought across much of the southwestern United States provides a remarkable natural experiment to test whether prescribed fire helps trees survive stressful conditions. If current practices for modifying forest conditions through fire are found to increase drought resistance, our project could help forest managers apply these methods across western forests more broadly. The results of this study may change management policy to maximize resource benefit from fire. Our specific questions are as follows. (1) Does prescribed fire actually increase forest resistance to drought, and if so, by how much? (2) If so, does the strength of that resistance depend on time since fire? For example, is drought resistance initially low following a burn, but increasing in subsequent years and decades? (3) Do the benefits of prescribed fire, with regard to resistance, vary among tree species and size classes? In particular, is the resistance of large trees - which sequester the most carbon and are critical to wildlife - enhanced by prescribed burns? Results will help land managers make informed decisions on how to allocate their limited climate-change adaptation funds.","parentId":"55130c96e4b02e76d75c075e","linkParentIds":["57a50a19e4b0ebae89b6d86e"],"contacts":[{"name":"Phillip van Mantgem","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"pvanmantgem@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Redwood Field Station, WERC"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"7078255189","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"95521","country":"USA","city":"Arcata","state":"CA","line1":"1655 Heindon Road"}}},{"name":"Southwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Donald A.

Land managers, as they work to develop robust climate change adaptation strategies, are keen to buy time by enhancing forest resistance (sensu Walker et al. 2004) to such abrupt, severe, and widespread changes. Reductions in tree density following prescribed fire have been widely presumed to increase resistance to drought. Yet this proposition has remained untested until now, meaning land managers do not have the basic information they need for critical cost-benefit analyses. \r\nProcedures\/Methods: We will examine the primary measure of forest resistance, tree survivorship, across hundreds of existing burned and unburned forest monitoring plots in which the fates of individual trees of all species and sizes have been tracked for decades. We will compare proportions of trees surviving the drought in the burned vs. unburned plots, quantifying the effects of time since fire and differences among species and size classes. We have already leveraged USGS and NPS funds to re-read many of these plots \u2013 mostly in California; we will seek SWCSC funds to re-read other plots in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.\r\nExpected Products and Information\/Technology Transfer: We will use LCC communication pathways (e.g., webinars) and on-site visits to communicate our findings to managers and the public. We will also produce peer-reviewed journal articles, with associated web-based outreach materials aimed at managers. We will make our data \u201copen access\u201d following publication to encourage further work on this topic.\t\r\nPersonnel\/Cooperators\/Partners: Our research team has extensive publication records in top journals in the fields of climate change impacts, fire science, forest ecology and tree-ring analysis. Much of our work has focused on understanding the patterns and processes of tree mortality in relation to disturbance and climate variability.\r\n"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":146620,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":146620}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":1022,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-10-31T18:48:04.000Z","title":"Wildfire - Credit: Mary Cernicek","imageHeight":766,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/552bcafbe4b026915857df7e?f=__disk__be%2F4d%2Fe7%2Fbe4de7cde366b220fffe3897a54de61a84d72d28","processed":false,"size":248790,"useForPreview":true,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"18dbbdb3b139a6c543e1a81c1018c942"},"name":"Fire_MaryCernicek_MPD.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__be\/4d\/e7\/be4de7cde366b220fffe3897a54de61a84d72d28","contentType":"image\/jpeg"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=552bcafbe4b026915857df7e&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=552bcafbe4b026915857df7e&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=552bcafbe4b026915857df7e&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=552bcafbe4b026915857df7e","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/552bcafbe4b026915857df7e\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/552bcafbe4b026915857df7e","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FightingDrought.zip","files":""}],"realParentId":"4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e","csc":"Southwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Phillip van Mantgem","Donald A.

For each scenario, two future time periods were modeled (2041-2060 and 2061-2080).

Southwestern U.S.?","body":"<div>There is a growing realization that current warming trends may be associated with increases in the size, frequency, and severity of forest fires in the West. While rising temperatures can create drought conditions that favor severe fires, it is also possible that drought limits the ability of trees to survive a fire. During a drought, there is less water available for trees and more outbreaks of harmful insects and pathogens can occur, both of which can weaken trees. Tree mortality is one means of measuring the severity of a fire, and evidence shows that trees exposed to drought conditions for periods of 5-10 years are already more sensitive to the effects of fire \u2013 suggesting that drought could indeed increase fire severity.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThis project will examine the poorly understood relationship between drought, fire, and tree mortality in the Southwest. Researchers will use existing data on controlled burns, tree-ring analysis, and detailed climate data to determine how these variables interact. Understanding how drought and fire might work together to cause tree death is critical. More dead trees translates into poorer habitat for wildlife, increased soil erosion, and greater carbon emissions following fires \u2013 which could worsen warming trends.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThe warming experienced so far in the Southwest is small compared to expected future conditions, making this analysis critical for the success of long-term forest conservation. Identifying exactly how drought and fire interact to impact trees can help forest managers better understand and plan for the effects of fire in the future.<\/div>\n","purpose":"Drought and fire are two well-known hazards expected to increase in the Southwest in an era of climate change. Might the effects of drought and fire combine to cause even greater risks for southwestern forests in the future? This research tries to solve part of this puzzle by discovering how drought might weaken trees, leading to increased tree death following fires. It is important to understand how drought and fire might work together to cause tree death; more frequent tree deaths will mean compromised wildlife habitat, increased erosion and greater carbon emissions following fires across the Southwest. Scientists from the USGS, University of Arizona and the National Park Service will work together using existing data coupled with tree ring analyses and detailed climate data to determine how all these factors fit together in recent fires. If we understand how these factors interact now, we can develop better estimates of the effects of fires in the future.","parentId":"531dd8c3e4b04cb293ee78ee","linkParentIds":["57a50a19e4b0ebae89b6d86e"],"contacts":[{"name":"Phillip van Mantgem","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"pvanmantgem@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Western Ecological Research Center (WERC)"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"7078255189","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"95521","country":"USA","city":"Arcata","state":"CA","line1":"1655 Heindon Road"}}},{"name":"Southwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Donald Falk","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Arizona"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Adrian Das","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jeffrey Kane","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Humboldt State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"MaryBeth Keifer","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"National Park Service"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jonathan Nesmith","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"National Park Service"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Nathan Stephenson","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Southwest CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"},{"name":"drought stress"},{"name":"fire severity"},{"name":"tree mortality"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-08-20","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2016-08-19","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-12-16T21:03:49.709-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-31T12:14:03.819-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Technical Summary","value":"Objectives\/Justification: We will test how climatically-induced stress at intermediate timescales (five to ten years) interacts with fire to increase tree mortality (a primary measure of fire severity) across the Southwest. \r\n\r\nBackground:  Pervasive warming can lead to chronic stress on forest trees, potentially resulting in increased sensitivity to fire-caused injuries. Thus, even when there is no change in fire intensity (the amount of heat released during a fire), fire severity (the number of trees killed) may increase. \r\n\r\nProcedures\/Methods: We will examine this question across the southwestern United States using existing national-scale prescribed fire monitoring databases supplemented with tree-ring analyses. Fire effects data (e.g., crown scorch) will be combined with empirical models relating climate to tree growth to understand the influence of climatic stress on post-fire mortality patterns. We expect our models to show drought stress resulting in lower (or more variable) patterns of tree growth, which in turn will increase sensitivity to fire-caused injuries.

Rather than taking a broad-scale, vulnerability-assessment approach, we created a species distribution model (SDM) for each focal species incorporating climatic, landscape, and plant variables. Baseline climate (1940\u20132009) was characterized with Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) data and future climate with global-circulation-model data under an A1B emission scenario. Climatic variables included monthly and seasonal temperature and precipitation; landscape variables included terrain ruggedness, soil type, and insolation; and plant variables included trees and shrubs commonly associated with a focal species. Not all species-distribution models contained a plant, but if they did, we included a built-in annual migration rate for more accurate plant-range projections in 2039 or 2099. We conducted a group meta-analysis to (1) determine how influential each variable class was when averaged across all species distribution models (birds or reptiles), and (2) identify the correlation among contemporary (2009) habitat fragmentation and biological attributes and future range projections (2039 or 2099). Projected changes in bird and reptile ranges varied widely among species, with one-third of the ranges predicted to expand and two-thirds predicted to contract. A group meta-analysis indicated that climatic variables were the most influential variable class when averaged across all models for both groups, followed by landscape and plant variables (birds), or plant and landscape variables (reptiles), respectively. The second part of the meta-analysis indicated that numerous contemporary habitat-fragmentation (for example, patch isolation) and biological-attribute (for example, clutch size, longevity) variables were significantly correlated with the magnitude of projected range changes for birds and reptiles. Patch isolation was a significant trans-specific driver of projected bird and reptile ranges, suggesting that strategic actions should focus on restoration and enhancement of habitat at local and regional scales to promote landscape connectivity and conservation of core areas.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50475939e4b067bd38f7f475"],"contacts":[{"name":"James R.

Three existing bias correction methods, and a new one developed here, are applied to daily maximum temperature and precipitation from 21 GCMs to investigate how different methods alter the climate change signal of the GCM. The quantile mapping (QM) and cumulative distribution function transform (CDF-t) bias correction methods can significantly alter the GCM\u2019s mean climate change signal, with differences of up to 2\u00b0C and 30% points for monthly mean temperature and precipitation, respectively. Equidistant quantile matching (EDCDFm) bias correction preserves GCM changes in mean daily maximum temperature but not precipitation. An extension to EDCDFm termed PresRat is introduced, which generally preserves the GCM changes in mean precipitation. Another problem is that GCMs can have difficulty simulating variance as a function of frequency. To address this, a frequency-dependent bias correction method is introduced that is twice as effective as standard bias correction in reducing errors in the models\u2019 simulation of variance as a function of frequency, and it does so without making any locations worse, unlike standard bias correction. Last, a preconditioning technique is introduced that improves the simulation of the annual cycle while still allowing the bias correction to take account of an entire season\u2019s values at once.","parentId":"50475a83e4b067bd38f7f487","contacts":[{"name":"David W.

We will deliver point and gridded observations and downscaled model projections, all at daily and 6 km resolution, on past and future climate extremes. Additionally, we will use the downscaled outputs to drive a hydrologic model and derive multiple probabilistic measures of water availability, flood, and drought. Simultaneously, we will work with end-users (primarily researchers who collaborate with decision-makers and aim to inform decisions about management of natural resources, but also local and regional managers and decision-makers) to further develop an application for interactive derivation of diverse climate metrics for spatial and temporal scales chosen by the user. As proofs of concept, we will initiate projects with multiple research groups in the Southwest. These groups are working directly with decision-makers in the Department of the Interior to project biological responses to climate extremes. Examples include responses of Mojave desert tortoises  and fire dynamics to drought or high winter precipitation; responses of salt marshes to frequent, intense storms; and potential increases in heat-related illnesses among visitors to national parks. The proposed work is a cooperative effort among Southwest Climate Science Center investigators. We will integrate the diverse expertise of host institutions to provide access to data, expert knowledge, and tools for technology transfer."},{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"FY 14 Grant ($457,931)","value":"G14AP00076"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":1368570.74,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2014","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":457931},{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":448199},{"year":"2016","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":462440.74}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":1818,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-10-31T18:24:38.000Z","title":"Drought-impacted San Luis Reservoir, CA - Credit: Cynthia Mendoza, USDA","imageHeight":1365,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c?f=__disk__82%2F8d%2F2c%2F828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0","processed":false,"size":858234,"useForPreview":true,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"4b75a4df7a380f05b45739b8ba85dc92"},"name":"SW-2014-2_Drought_SanLuisReservoir_CA_CynthiaMendoza_USDA.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__82\/8d\/2c\/828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0","contentType":"image\/jpeg"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"ImprovingUnders.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Southwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Erica Fleishman","Kelly Redmond","Jonathan Overpeck","Daniel R Cayan","Michael Dettinger","Mark Schwartz","Alexander  Gershunov","Britta Daudert"],"orgs":["Southwest CSC"],"funding_years":"2014","fy":"2014"},"55c9cb34e4b08400b1fdb711":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5012a813e4b05140039e02d1","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Increasing elevation of fire in the Sierra Nevada and implications for forest change","relatedTitle":"The Vulnerability of Forests to Climate Change and Wildfire in the Southwestern U.S.","id":"55c9cb34e4b08400b1fdb711","relatedId":"5012a813e4b05140039e02d1","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/55c9cb34e4b08400b1fdb711","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"The Vulnerability of Forests to Climate Change and Wildfire in the Southwestern U.S.","relatedTitle":"Increasing elevation of fire in the Sierra Nevada and implications for forest change","id":"5012a813e4b05140039e02d1","relatedId":"55c9cb34e4b08400b1fdb711","annotation":null}]},"id":"55c9cb34e4b08400b1fdb711","title":"Increasing elevation of fire in the Sierra Nevada and implications for forest change","body":"<p><span>Fire in high-elevation forest ecosystems can have severe impacts on forest structure, function and biodiversity. Using a 105-year data set, we found increasing elevation extent of fires in the Sierra Nevada, and pose five hypotheses to explain this pattern. Beyond the recognized pattern of increasing fire frequency in the Sierra Nevada since the late 20th century, we find that the upper elevation extent of those fires has also been increasing. Factors such as fire season climate and fuel build up are recognized potential drivers of changes in fire regimes. Patterns of warming climate and increasing stand density are consistent with both the direction and magnitude of increasing elevation of wildfire. Reduction in high elevation wildfire suppression and increasing ignition frequencies may also contribute to the observed pattern. Historical biases in fire reporting are recognized, but not likely to explain the observed patterns. The four plausible mechanistic hypotheses (changes in fire management, climate, fuels, ignitions) are not mutually exclusive, and likely have synergistic interactions that may explain the observed changes. Irrespective of mechanism, the observed pattern of increasing occurrence of fire in these subalpine forests may have significant impacts on their resilience to changing climatic conditions.<br><span><br><br><br><\/span><\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50476340e4b067bd38f7f4ac"],"contacts":[{"name":"Mark W.

While cool season precipitation explains most of the variability in annual flows, temperature appears to be highly influential under certain conditions, with the role of antecedent fall soil moisture less clear. In both wet and dry years, when flow is substantially different than expected given precipitation, these factors can modulate the dominant precipitation influence on streamflow. Different combinations of temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture can result in flow deficits of similar magnitude, but recent droughts have been amplified by warmer temperatures that exacerbate the effects of relatively modest precipitation deficits. Since 1988, a marked increase in the frequency of warm years with lower flows than expected, given precipitation, suggests continued warming temperatures will be an increasingly important influence in reducing future UCRB water supplies.","parentId":"544a9979e4b03653c63f89c7","contacts":[{"name":"Connie A Woodhouse","oldPartyId":37917,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from FPPS data from 1992 through 2009.","firstName":"Connie","middleName":"A","lastName":"Woodhouse","organization":{"displayText":"University of Arizona"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Gregory T Pederson","oldPartyId":13319,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"gpederson@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Gregory","middleName":"T","lastName":"Pederson","organization":{"displayText":"Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"4069946556","officePhone":"4069947390","streetAddress":{"zip":"59715","city":"Bozeman","state":"MT","line1":"2327 University Way"},"buildingCode":"KKO","name":"Gregory T Pederson\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

This foundation presents a context and guide for contemporary indigenous approaches to address climate change impacts that are comprehensive and holistic. Tribal communities and indigenous peoples across the United States are reenvisioning the role of science in the Anthropocene; working to strengthen government-to-government relationships in climate change initiatives; and leading climate change research, mitigation and adaptation plans through indigenous ingenuity. Unique adaptive capacities of tribal communities stem from their ethics and knowledge, and help frame and guide successful adaptation. As documented in the Special Issue of the Climatic Change Journal on the impacts of climate change to U.S. indigenous communities (Maldonado and others 2013), these issues include the loss of traditional knowledge; impacts to forests, ecosystems, traditional foods, and water; thawing of Arctic sea ice and permafrost; and relocation of communities. This collaboration, by more than 50 authors from tribal communities, academia, government agencies, and NGOs, demonstrates the increasing awareness, interest, and need to understand the unique ways in which climate change will affect tribal cultures, lands, and traditional ways of life. Climate change is expected to affect animal and plant species that indigenous people depend on for their livelihoods, health and cultural practices. The impacts of climate change on forests and other ecosystems that are home to many of these species require tribal engagement in climate change research, assessments, and adaptation efforts. This paper synthesizes key issues and case studies related to climate change impacts on tribally valued forest resources and tribal adaptive responses to climate change.","parentId":"504763d9e4b067bd38f7f4be","contacts":[{"name":"Karletta Chief","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Arizona"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"John J.

These PDFs vary significantly between years, with important geographical differences in the relationship between the central tendency and tails, revealing differing linkages between weather and climate. The warmest and coldest extremes do not necessarily follow the distribution center. In some regions one tail of the distribution shows more variability than does the other. For example, in California the cold tail is more variable while the warm tail remains relatively stable, so warm years are associated with fewer cold extremes but not necessarily more warm extremes. The opposite relationship is seen in the Great Plains. Changes in temperature PDFs are conditioned by different phases of El Ni\u00f1o-La Ni\u00f1a (ENSO) and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). In the Southern Great Plains, La Ni\u00f1a and\/or negative PDO are associated with generally warmer conditions. However, in terms of extremes, while the warm tails become thicker and longer, the cool tails are not impacted\u2014extremely warm days become more frequent but extremely cool days are not less frequent. In contrast, in coastal California, La Ni\u00f1a or negative PDO bring generally cooler conditions with more\/stronger cold extremes but the warm extreme probability is not significantly affected. These results could have implications for global warming. If a rigid shift of the whole range occurs, then warm years are not necessarily a good analogue for a warmer climate. If global warming instead brings regional changes more aligned with a preferred state of dominant climate variability modes, then we may see asymmetric changes in the tails of local temperature PDFs.","parentId":"522516d0e4b0e4746d62afb1","contacts":[{"name":"IOP Publishing","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Kristen Guirguis","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Scripps Institution of Oceanography"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alexander Gershunov","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Scripps Institution of Oceanography"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Daniel R Cayan","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Scripps Institution of Oceanography"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1748-9326\/10\/12\/124023\/meta","title":"Guirguis et al. 2015","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"temperature extremes"},{"name":"climate variability"}],"dates":[{"type":"Acquisition","dateString":"2015-12-22","label":"Acquisition"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-01-27T10:56:23.880-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-01-27T11:10:02.865-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Environmental Research Letters","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issn","value":"1748-9326"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"volume","value":"10"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issue","value":"12"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"startPage","value":"124023"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1088\/1748-9326\/10\/12\/124023"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Southwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e","people":["Kristen Guirguis","Alexander Gershunov","Daniel R Cayan"],"orgs":["IOP Publishing","Southwest CSC"]},"57c604e2e4b0f2f0cebdab96":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"57c604e2e4b0f2f0cebdab96","title":"Leaf to Landscape: Understanding and Mapping the Vulnerability of Forests to Hotter Droughts","body":"<div>Forests across the southwestern U.S. are crucial components of recreation and play an important role in state and local economies.

Our results will help forest managers target forest treatments \u2013 such as prescribed fire \u2013 that are aimed at increasing the likelihood that forests will persist in the face of future climatic changes.","parentId":"57c5fb99e4b0f2f0cebdab3b","contacts":[{"name":"Koren R Nydick","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.","firstName":"Koren","middleName":"R","lastName":"Nydick","organization":{"displayText":"National Park Service"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Anthony Ambrose","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of California"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Gregory P Asner","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.","firstName":"Gregory","middleName":"P","lastName":"Asner","organization":{"displayText":"Carnegie Airborne Observatory"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Wendy Baxter","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of California"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Adrian J Das","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"adas@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Ecologist","firstName":"Adrian","middleName":"J","lastName":"Das","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Western Ecological Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"5595653177","officePhone":"5595653179","streetAddress":{"zip":"93271","city":"Three Rivers","state":"CA","line1":"47050 Generals Highway"},"buildingCode":"WBZ","name":"Adrian J Das\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

To be usable, the science must be relevant to their context and the complex management challenges they face and credible and legitimate in their eyes. The literature on usable science provides guiding principles for its development, which indicate that climate scientists who want to participate in the process need skills in addition to their traditional disciplinary training to facilitate communicating, interacting, and developing and sustaining relationships with stakeholders outside their disciplines. However, the literature does not address questions about what specific skills are needed and how to provide climate scientists with these skills. To address these questions, this article presents insights from interviews with highly experienced and respected \"first generation\u201d climate science integrators from across the United States. The term \u201cclimate science integrator\u201d is used to refer to climate scientists who specialize in helping decision-makers to integrate the best available climate science into their decision-making processes. The cadre of scientists who participated in the research has largely developed their methods for working successfully with stakeholders without formal training but often with the guidance of a mentor. Their collective wisdom illuminates the kinds of skills needed to be a successful science integrator and provides mentoring for aspiring science integrators. It also suggests the types of training that would cultivate these skills and indicates ways to change academic training and institutions to better encourage the next generation and to support this kind of work.","parentId":"526abf21e4b0be4db9fbf28b","contacts":[{"name":"Julie Brugger","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Arizona"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alison Meadow","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Arizona"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alexandra Horangic","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Arizona"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/journals.ametsoc.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1175\/BAMS-D-14-00289.1","title":"Brugger et al. 2016","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Coproduction"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2016-03","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-05-01T12:57:14.626-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-05-01T13:04:36.893-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1175\/BAMS-D-14-00289.1"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Southwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e","people":["Julie Brugger","Alison Meadow","Alexandra Horangic"],"orgs":["Southwest CSC"]},"56feafa1e4b0328dcb7dec33":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/51e44c75e4b08262df3d63d9","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Linking climate, hydrology and ecological changes at intermediate timescales in Cleve Creek, Eastern Nevada","relatedTitle":"Linking Climatic, Hydrological, and Ecological Changes at Intermediate Timescales in a Great Basin Watershed","id":"56feafa1e4b0328dcb7dec33","relatedId":"51e44c75e4b08262df3d63d9","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/56feafa1e4b0328dcb7dec33","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Linking Climatic, Hydrological, and Ecological Changes at Intermediate Timescales in a Great Basin Watershed","relatedTitle":"Linking climate, hydrology and ecological changes at intermediate timescales in Cleve Creek, Eastern Nevada","id":"51e44c75e4b08262df3d63d9","relatedId":"56feafa1e4b0328dcb7dec33","annotation":null}]},"id":"56feafa1e4b0328dcb7dec33","title":"Linking climate, hydrology and ecological changes at intermediate timescales in Cleve Creek, Eastern Nevada","body":"This collection contains GSFLOW and R-RHESSys model input and output files.

Changes at Intermediate Timescales in a Great Basin Watershed","body":"<div> This project links climate, hydrological, and ecological changes over the next 30 years in a Great Basin watershed. In recent years, climate variability on annual and decadal time scales has been recognized as greater than commonly perceived with increasing impacts on ecosystems and available water resources. Changes in vegetation distribution, composition and productivity resulting from climate change affect plant water use, which in turn can alter stream flow, groundwater and eventually available water resources. To better understand these links, project researchers implemented two computer-based numeric models in the Cleve Creek watershed in the Schell Creek Range, east of Ely, Nevada. The application of the two models to study the hydrologic and ecological processes in the watershed allows us to look forward in time over a range of possible scenarios to predict future water availability under simulated climate variability. Ultimately, the models can provide an array of outcomes that can help water resource managers identify threats and opportunities posed by climate variations during the next thirty years. <\/div>","parentId":"526ab86ae4b0be4db9fbf270","contacts":[{"name":"Alexandra Lutz","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"Alexandra.Lutz@dri.edu","cellPhone":"775-673-7418","company":"DRI","organization":{"displayText":"Desert Research Institute (DRI)"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"775-673-7418","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Rosemary Carroll","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"DRI"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Guoping Tang","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"DRI"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"James Thomas","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from FPPS data from 1992 through 2009.","firstName":"James","middleName":"R","lastName":"Thomas","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Joseph F.

These storms have historically had costly and long-lasting societal and&nbsp;ecological impacts, including damage to businesses, transportation networks, and public utilities,&nbsp;disruptions of water supplies, and disturbances of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We will&nbsp;develop a historical atmospheric river (AR) chronology that identifies where and when these&nbsp;events have made landfall along the west coast during the past 30 years.

While the general principles of coproduction\u2014establishing long-term relationships between scientists and stakeholders, ensuring two-way communication between both groups, and keeping the focus on the production of usable science\u2014are well understood, the mechanisms for achieving those goals have been discussed less. It is proposed here that a more deliberate approach to building the relationships and communication channels between scientists and stakeholders will yield better outcomes. The authors present five approaches to collaborative research that can be used to structure a coproduction process that each suit different types of research or management questions, decision-making contexts, and resources and skills available to contribute to the process of engagement. By using established collaborative research approaches scientists can be more effective in learning from stakeholders, can be more confident when engaging with stakeholders because there are guideposts to follow, and can assess both the process and outcomes of collaborative projects, which will help the whole community of stakeholder-engaged climate-scientists learn about coproduction of knowledge.","parentId":"526abf21e4b0be4db9fbf28b","contacts":[{"name":"Alison M.

Existing hydrologic models of the Upper San Pedro Basin and the Upper and Middle Verde watersheds will be used with global climate models to simulate and project causes and impacts of climate change.

<p>Ecological niche modelling is one of the main tools that allows for the incorporation of climate change effects into conservation planning. For example, ecological niche model predictions can be used to rank species by degree of predicted future habitat loss. While many studies have considered how different modelling decisions contribute to uncertainty in niche model outputs, here we evaluate how metrics used to rank species by conservation risk respond to the choice of global climate models, greenhouse gas emission scenarios, suitable versus unsuitable threshold values, and the degree of model complexity.<\/p> \n <\/div> \n<\/div> \n<div> \n <h4>Location<\/h4> \n <div> \n  <p>California, USA.<\/p> \n <\/div> \n<\/div> \n<div> \n <h4>Methods<\/h4> \n <div> \n  <p>We built ecological niche models for 153 species of reptiles and amphibians. Reduced complexity models were compared to default complexity models using AICc to select climate variables and tune Maxent' s built-in regularization parameter. We predicted the distribution of climatically suitable habitat under future (2041\u20132060) climate conditions according to 11 global climate models, four representative concentration pathways, and three threshold values. Two metrics to rank species by predicted future loss of climatically suitable habitat were calculated for each set of modelling decisions. To determine the effects of modelling decisions on rankings, we used mixed models.<\/p> \n <\/div> \n<\/div> \n<div> \n <h4>Results<\/h4> \n <div> \n  <p>Our results indicate that while individual modelling decisions had relatively small effects on species ranks alone, in combination, they lead to very different conservation assessments.<\/p> \n <\/div> \n<\/div> \n<div> \n <h4>Main conclusions<\/h4> \n <div> \n  <p>We recommend that a wide range of modelling decisions be explored and that variation in ranks across runs be reported as a first step in identifying the uncertainty in rank metrics used for assessing conservation risk under changing, but uncertain climate predictions.<\/p> \n <\/div> \n<\/div>","parentId":"502bdd9be4b098307cc38b6f","contacts":[{"name":"Amber Wright","type":"Author","organization":{"displayText":"University of California, Davis and University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Robert Hijmans","type":"Author","organization":{"displayText":"University of California, Davis"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Mark Schwartz","type":"Author","organization":{"displayText":"University of California, Davis"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"H.

Consequently, the ability of climate models to simulate major natural modes of variability and their teleconnections provides important context for the interpretation and use of climate change projections. Comparisons reported here indicate that the CMIP5 generation of global climate models shows significant improvements in simulations of key Pacific climate mode and their teleconnections to North America compared to earlier CMIP3 simulations. The performance of 14 models with simulations in both the CMIP3 and CMIP5 archives are assessed using singular value decomposition analysis of simulated and observed winter Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and concurrent precipitation over the contiguous United States and northwestern Mexico. Most of the models reproduce basic features of the key natural mode and their teleconnections, albeit with notable regional deviations from observations in both SST and precipitation. Increasing horizontal resolution in the CMIP5 simulations is an important, but not a necessary, factor in the improvement from CMIP3 to CMIP5.","parentId":"502bdd9be4b098307cc38b6f","contacts":[{"name":"Southwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Suraj Polade","type":"Author","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alexander Gershunov","type":"Author","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Daniel R Cayan","oldPartyId":1669,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"drcayan@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Oceanographer","firstName":"Daniel","middleName":"R","lastName":"Cayan","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Branch of Regional Research, Western Region"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8585348561","officePhone":"8585344507","streetAddress":{"zip":"92093","country":"US","city":"La Jolla","state":"CA","line1":"Scripps Inst.

This can happen temporarily on timescales of a season to several years to a decade or two. Natural variability is poorly described and attributed to specific causes, contributing to uncertainty and misunderstandings about the nature of climate change that stakeholders and resource managers attempt to anticipate. There exists, therefore, a need to clarify the magnitude and causality of natural climate variability. This connection needs to be explained for locally-experienced weather and particularly for daily extreme events, whose seasonal behavior impacts both resources and imagination. Conversely, it is also important to assess the impact of long-term climate change on natural variability affecting the Southwest. The research team will focus on such assessments and clarify impacts of natural climate variability on the frequencies and intensities of specific extreme temperature and precipitation events as well as their cascading influences on streamflow in the changing climate of the Southwest. Results are meant to clarify the roles of natural influences on varying magnitude and rate of climate change over space and time, thus increasing stakeholders\u2019 awareness of certainty versus uncertainty about the future and facilitating betterinformed decisions on various timescales.&nbsp; <\/div>","parentId":"526ab86ae4b0be4db9fbf270","contacts":[{"name":"Alexander Gershunov","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"sasha@ucsd.edu","organization":{"displayText":"UC San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (UCSD\/SIO)"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"858-534-8418","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"92093-0224","country":"USA","city":"La Jolla","state":"CA","line1":"Climate, Atmospheric Science and Physical Oceanography (CASPO) Division\r\nScripps Institution of Oceanography\r\nUniversity of California, San Diego"}}},{"name":"Suraj Polade","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"UCSD\/SIO"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Noah Knowles","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS, Menlo Park"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Rupa Basu","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Cal\/EPA, Oakland"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Deanna Dullen","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Devil\u2019s Postpile National Monument"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Daniel R Cayan","oldPartyId":1669,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"drcayan@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Oceanographer","firstName":"Daniel","middleName":"R","lastName":"Cayan","organization":{"displayText":"Branch of Regional Research, Western Region"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8585348561","streetAddress":{"zip":"92093","country":"US","city":"La Jolla","state":"CA","line1":"Scripps Inst.

Species-specific responses in northeast Pacific tidal marshes","body":"<p>Coastal wetland plants are adapted to varying degrees of inundation. However, functional relationships between inundation and productivity are poorly characterized for most species. Determining species-specific tolerances to inundation is necessary to evaluate sea-level rise (SLR) effects on future marsh plant community composition, quantify organic matter inputs to marsh accretion, and inform predictive modeling of tidal wetland persistence. In 2 macrotidal estuaries in the northeast Pacific we grew 5 common species in experimental mesocosms across a gradient of tidal elevations to assess effects on growth. We also tested whether species abundance distributions along elevation gradients in adjacent marshes matched productivity profiles in the mesocosms. We found parabolic relationships between inundation and total plant biomass and shoot counts in&nbsp;<i>Spartina foliosa<\/i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Bolboschoenus maritimus<\/i>&nbsp;in California, USA, and in&nbsp;<i>Carex lyngbyei<\/i>&nbsp;in Oregon, USA, with maximum total plant biomass occurring at 38, 28, and 15% time submerged, respectively. However, biomass of&nbsp;<i>Salicornia pacifica<\/i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Juncus balticus<\/i>&nbsp;declined monotonically with increasing inundation. Inundation effects on the ratio of belowground to aboveground biomass varied inconsistently among species. In comparisons of field distributions with mesocosm results,&nbsp;<i>B. maritimus<\/i>,&nbsp;<i>C. lyngbyei<\/i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>J. balticus<\/i>&nbsp;were abundant in marshes at or above elevations corresponding with their maximum productivity; however,&nbsp;<i>S. foliosa<\/i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>S. pacifica<\/i>&nbsp;were frequently abundant at lower elevations corresponding with sub-optimal productivity. Our findings show species-level differences in how marsh plant growth may respond to future SLR and highlight the sensitivity of high marsh species such as&nbsp;<i>S. pacifica<\/i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>J. balticus<\/i>&nbsp;to increases in flooding.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50464660e4b0241d49d62c5d","50475751e4b067bd38f7f460"],"contacts":[{"name":"Christopher Janousek","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"cjanousek@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Kevin J.

It is thought that diversity in precipitation-causing weather events is fundamental in producing heavy-tailed distributions, and it arises from theory that at least one of the precipitation types contributing to a heavy-tailed climatological record must also be heavy-tailed. Precipitation is a multi-scale phenomenon with a rich spatial structure and short decorrelation length and timescales; the spatiotemporal scale at which precipitation is observed is thus an important factor when considering its statistics and extremes. In this study, we examine the spatiotemporal scaling behavior of intense precipitation from point-scale to large grid cells and from 1&nbsp;day to 4&nbsp;weeks over the entire globe. We go on to validate the current generation of historically-forced climate models and reanalyses against observational data at consistent spatial scales. Our results demonstrate that the prevalence and magnitude of heavy tails in observations decrease when moving to lower spatiotemporal resolutions, as is consistent with stochastic theory. Reanalyses and climate models generally reproduce large, synoptic scale distribution classifications, but struggle to reproduce the statistics in regions that are strongly affected by mesoscale phenomena. We discuss these results in relation to physically consistent atmospheric regimes. We conclude with a global view of precipitation distribution type at daily resolution as calculated from the best-performing reanalysis, the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis.","parentId":"522516d0e4b0e4746d62afb1","contacts":[{"name":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Nicholas R.

Essentially, the ways in which researchers and resource managers collaborate can affect the use of scientific information in decision-making. Previous research has shown that relatively more collaboration between researchers and resource managers (or even the general public) tends to lead to more and more effective use of new scientific information.&nbsp; However, we do not yet have good ways to evaluate these research processes or the outcomes we expect them to produce.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThis project will assess the key variables necessary for the successful production of usable climate information. To do so, researchers will evaluate the collaborative science approach currently being implemented in a project on managing forests for drought in California. Researchers will interview the project\u2019s scientists about their goals and stakeholder engagement approaches; observe meetings between scientists and managers; interview both scientists and managers at the conclusion of the project to identify the level of satisfaction with the approach used; and interview managers six months later to follow-up on how the information was actually used in decision-making.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThe results of this project will help inform best practices for scientists to engage stakeholders during the research process.

Outcomes can include conceptual information use, such as raising awareness of an issue, instrumental use of information (e.g., to inform a decision), and the impact of the information (e.g., demonstrating a link between the information and a successful management outcome). In this project, a recently developed evaluation tool set, including indicators of success, metrics, and data-collection approaches will be applied to capture the key variables necessary to the successful production of usable climate knowledge. The evaluation approach will be tested in the context of climate science being developed in a high-need, high-stakes environment: resource management under California\u2019s current exceptional drought conditions.","parentId":"55130c96e4b02e76d75c075e","contacts":[{"name":"Alison Meadow","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Arizona"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Southwest CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2015"},{"name":"Decision Making"},{"name":"Drought"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2015-10-01","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2017-09-30","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-01-15T11:05:38.037-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-31T13:14:32.183-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"facetName":"Project","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Type","value":"Grant"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Number","value":"G15AP00175"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":164250,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":164250}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":1806,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-10-31T19:14:06.000Z","title":"Klamath National Forest, CA - Credit: Lance Cheung, USDA","imageHeight":1354,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/569934f2e4b0fbd3f7fa4ed0?f=__disk__bb%2Fea%2F9f%2Fbbea9fde0936333a7020b5c7c12039db98f2be3f","processed":false,"size":933584,"useForPreview":true,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"88de7d3a76692d75d2f854d5dedc92c2"},"name":"KlamathNatlForest_CA_LanceCheung_USDA.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__bb\/ea\/9f\/bbea9fde0936333a7020b5c7c12039db98f2be3f","contentType":"image\/jpeg"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=569934f2e4b0fbd3f7fa4ed0&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=569934f2e4b0fbd3f7fa4ed0&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=569934f2e4b0fbd3f7fa4ed0&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=569934f2e4b0fbd3f7fa4ed0","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/569934f2e4b0fbd3f7fa4ed0\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/569934f2e4b0fbd3f7fa4ed0","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"ProducingImpact.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Southwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e","people":["Alison Meadow","Southwest CSC"],"funding_years":"2015","fy":"2015"},"57c5faa6e4b0f2f0cebdab2f":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"57c5faa6e4b0f2f0cebdab2f","title":"Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe Traditional Knowledge and Climate Change Adaptation","body":"<div>Native Americans throughout the Southwest are vulnerable to climate change due to intimate relationships with the environments and landscapes upon which their cultures, traditions, and livelihoods depend. The Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe (PLPT) in Nevada is profoundly connected physically, culturally, and spiritually to Pyramid Lake, the endangered cui-\u00adui fish, and the threatened Lahontan cutthroat trout. While the tribe has adapted to non-\u00adclimatic stressors over the past century, climate change impacts to water resources pose a threat to the ecosystems and species of fish so deeply important to the PLPT. Our previous research indicates that PLPT is an exemplary leader in adaptive planning, given that tribal members are keenly aware of and concerned for climate change impacts to Pyramid Lake. Climate adaptation that considers traditional knowledge and livelihoods of tribal members is critical to successful adaptation for PLPT. We will conduct interviews and focus groups with community members in order to better understand the role of traditional knowledge in PLPT culture and its potential use in climate adaptation. This collaborative research addresses the need for climate change adaptation research in the United States that incorporates tribal perspectives and can offer insight for adaptation planning efforts among other tribes.<\/div>\n","parentId":"57c5fb99e4b0f2f0cebdab3b","contacts":[{"name":"Karletta Chief","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Arizona"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Edward Schuyler Chew","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Arizona,"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Southwest CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2016"},{"name":"Tribal"},{"name":"Traditional Knowledge"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2016-08-01","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2018-07-31","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-08-30T15:29:10.315-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-23T09:10:41.310-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Type","value":"Grant"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Number","value":"G16AP00162"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":19781.7,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2016","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":19781.7}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":2207,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-11-23T16:10:13.000Z","title":"Pyramid Lake, NV -

Cheatgrass is highly flammable, and as it has expanded, the extent and frequency of fire in the Great Basin has increased by as much as 200%. These changes in fire regimes are associated with loss of the native sagebrush, grasses, and herbaceous flowering plants that provide habitat for many native animals, including Greater Sage-Grouse. Changes in vegetation and fire management have been suggested with the intent of conserving Greater Sage-Grouse. However, the potential responses of other sensitive-status birds to these changes in management have not been well evaluated.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nThis project will examine current and future interactions among cheatgrass density, precipitation, and fire across the Great Basin. Growth of cheatgrass is much more responsive than many native plants to variation in precipitation, especially during winter and spring. The project also will model current and future cover of sagebrush and native grasses and forbs, and explore how projected changes in fire patterns and vegetation and fire management may affect sensitive-status breeding birds. The results of this project may inform decisions about management of vegetation, fuels, and habitat for Greater Sage-Grouse.<br>\n<br>\nThis project is also supported by the Joint Fire Science Program.<\/div>\n","purpose":"As the distribution and abundance of non-native cheatgrass ( Bromus tectorum) in the Great Basin has increased, the extent and frequency of fire in the region has increased by as much as 200%. These changes in fire regimes are associated with loss of the sagebrush ( Artemisia tridentata) and native grasses and forbs in which many native animals, including Greater Sage-Grouse ( Centrocercus urophasianus; henceforth, sage grouse), breed and feed. Changes in fire regimes, fuels treatments, and post-fire restoration have been suggested with the intent of increasing the probability of sage-grouse persistence. However, the potential responses of other sensitive-status birds to these interventions have not been assessed rigorously. We will model current and future (to 2050) spatial interactions among cheatgrass cover and biomass, precipitation, and fire across the Great Basin and model current and future cover of sagebrush and herbaceous vegetation. For tractability, our analyses of percent cover of sagebrush and herbaceous vegetation, and of the habitat quality and occupancy of sensitive-status birds, will focus on three areas: the eastern Owyhee uplands (Idaho, Oregon, and Nevada), Bodie Hills-Pine Nut Mountains (California and Nevada), and east-central Great Basin (Nevada and Utah), each corresponding to the area covered by one Landsat scene (~185 x 185 km). These three areas span both biogeographic gradients and gradients of isolation and resilience of sage grouse. We further will examine how projected changes in fire regimes and fire and fuels treatments may affect habitat quality for and probability of occupancy of sensitive-status breeding birds. Additionally, we will use statistical change-point analyses to detect any abrupt, nonlinear temporal changes-thresholds-in projected vegetation cover, habitat quality, and occupancy. Detection of ecological thresholds, if they exist, may suggest fuels treatments and restoration actions that will decrease the probability of entering into or remaining within undesirable ecological states.","parentId":"55130c4fe4b02e76d75c0755","linkParentIds":["55130c96e4b02e76d75c075e"],"contacts":[{"name":"Erica Fleishman","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"efleishman@ucdavis.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Erica","lastName":"Fleishman","organization":{"displayText":"University of California, Davis"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jennifer Balch","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Colorado, Boulder"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Bethany Bradley","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","jobTitle":"Assistant Professor","firstName":"Bethany","lastName":"Bradley","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"Bethany Bradley\/UMASS -

The localized constructed analogs (LOCA) method produces downscaled estimates suitable for hydrological simulations using a multiscale spatial matching scheme to pick appropriate analog days from observations. First, a pool of candidate observed analog days is chosen by matching the model field to be downscaled to observed days over the region that is positively correlated with the point being downscaled, which leads to a natural independence of the downscaling results to the extent of the domain being downscaled. Then, the one candidate analog day that best matches in the local area around the grid cell being downscaled is the single analog day used there. Most grid cells are downscaled using only the single locally selected analog day, but locations whose neighboring cells identify a different analog day use a weighted combination of the center and adjacent analog days to reduce edge discontinuities. By contrast, existing constructed analog methods typically use a weighted average of the same 30 analog days for the entire domain. By greatly reducing this averaging, LOCA produces better estimates of extreme days, constructs a more realistic depiction of the spatial coherence of the downscaled field, and reduces the problem of producing too many light-precipitation days. The LOCA method is more computationally expensive than existing constructed analog techniques, but it is still practical for downscaling numerous climate model simulations with limited computational resources.","parentId":"50475a83e4b067bd38f7f487","contacts":[{"name":"David Pierce","type":"Author","organization":{"displayText":"University of California, San Diego"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Daniel R Cayan","oldPartyId":1669,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"drcayan@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Oceanographer","firstName":"Daniel","middleName":"R","lastName":"Cayan","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Branch of Regional Research, Western Region"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8585348561","officePhone":"8585344507","streetAddress":{"zip":"92093","country":"US","city":"La Jolla","state":"CA","line1":"Scripps Inst.

With ongoing global change, there is an urgent need to expand existing networks of important conservation areas around the world. In the western United States, vast areas of public land, including those administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), present substantial conservation opportunities. For 11 contiguous western states, we used a novel multiple-criteria analysis to model and map contiguous areas of roadless BLM land that possessed important ecological indicators of high biodiversity, resilience to climate change, and landscape connectivity. Specifically, we leveraged available spatial datasets to implement a systematic and statistically robust analysis of seven key indicators at three different spatial scales, and to identify the locations of potential conservation priority areas (CPAs) across 294,274&nbsp;km2 &nbsp;of roadless BLM land. Within this extent, and based on conservative thresholds in our results, we identified 43,417&nbsp;km2 &nbsp;of land with relatively high conservation value and 117 unique CPAs totaling 6291&nbsp;km2 . Most CPA lands were located in Utah, Colorado, Arizona, Oregon, and Nevada. Overall, CPAs had higher species richness, vegetation community diversity, topographic complexity, and surface water availability than existing BLM protected areas. CPAs often corresponded with locations known to have important wilderness characteristics or were adjacent to established areas of ecological, social, or cultural importance. These CPAs represent a diverse set of places that can be used by multiple stakeholders in ongoing or future landscape conservation and special designation efforts in BLM and adjacent ownerships. Our methodological framework and novel weighting approach can accommodate a wide range of input variables and is readily applicable to other jurisdictions and regions within the U.S. and beyond.","parentId":"526abfdde4b0be4db9fbf29b","contacts":[{"name":"Brett Dickson","type":"Author","organization":{"displayText":"a Conservation Science Partners, Inc."},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Luke Zachmann","type":"Author","organization":{"displayText":"a Conservation Science Partners, Inc."},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Christine Albano","type":"Author","description":"Record created from FPPS data from 1992 through 2009.","firstName":"Christine","middleName":"M","lastName":"Albano","organization":{"displayText":"University of California, Davis"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006320714002882","title":"Dickson et al. 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Biodiversity"},{"name":"BLM"},{"name":"Connectivity"},{"name":"Resilience"},{"name":"Richnes"},{"name":"Richness"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-08-24","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-11-20T10:40:04.171-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-19T08:37:37.033-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Biological Conservation","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI Number","value":"doi:10.1016\/j.biocon.2014.08.001"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Southwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e","people":["Brett Dickson","Luke Zachmann","Christine Albano"],"orgs":["Southwest CSC"]},"561ff937e4b03ee62faa90ee":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"561ff937e4b03ee62faa90ee","title":"The Impact of Drought on Waterbirds and Their Wetland Habitats in California\u2019s Central Valley","body":"<div>California\u2019s Central Valley is a nexus for water resources in the state, draining the Sacramento and San Joaquin River watersheds. Urban centers, agricultural operations, and the environment all compete for limited water, and demand is expected to only increase as the population grows and agriculture intensifies. At the same time, the water supply is projected to decrease as temperatures rise, precipitation patterns change, and the frequency of extreme droughts increases.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThe Central Valley also provides critical wetland habitats to migratory waterbirds, and wetland managers require information on how to best use water resources to support wildlife objectives, particularly during drought. This project seeks to evaluate how drought influences the distribution, abundance, and timing of wetland habitat in the Central Valley. This information will then be used to assess the effects of drought on habitat and food availability for waterbirds, and subsequently, waterbird movements.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThere is currently a lack of available data on wetland habitat in the Central Valley, as well as on how waterbird movements are influenced by habitat availability. Using near real-time tracking of waterbird habitats and movements, this study will address both of these needs and will enable researchers to identify gaps in habitat availability and food resources for waterbirds that occur as a result of drought. The results of this study will provide critical guidance for managers seeking to efficiently allocate limited water resources and provide the best possible habitat for waterbirds in the Central Valley, even during drought.&nbsp;<\/div>\n","purpose":"Wetland managers in the Central Valley of California require information regarding the amount and location of existing wetland habitat to make decisions on how to best use water resources to support multiple wildlife objectives, particularly during drought. Scientists from the USGS-Western Ecological Research Center, Point Blue Conservation Science, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service are partnering to learn how the flooded wetland, often agricultural, habitats used by waterfowl and shorebirds change through the year. During extreme drought conditions, the ability to provide sufficient water for wildlife often depends on the timing of water deliveries and decisions whether to fallow croplands. Waterfowl and shorebirds may be particularly affected by these decisions since they typically rest and feed in flooded habitats. Poor habitats resulting from improper water deliveries could reduce waterfowl hunting opportunities and body condition. Point Blue will develop near real-time tracking of waterbird habitats and the USGS will connect this with near real-time tracking of waterfowl throughout the valley to learn which habitats the birds use and why. This will teach us how wetlands can be managed to provide the best possible habitat for waterbirds even during extreme drought.","parentId":"55130c96e4b02e76d75c075e","linkParentIds":["56004655e4b05d6c4e50458d"],"contacts":[{"name":"Joseph Fleskes","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"joe_fleskes@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Dixon Field Station, WERC"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"5306695074","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"95620","country":"USA","city":"Dixon","state":"CA","line1":"800 Business Park Drive, Suite D"}}},{"name":"Matthew Reiter","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"mreiter@pointblue.org","organization":{"displayText":"Point Blue Conservation Science"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"null","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"null","state":"null","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"Southwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Michael L Casazza","oldPartyId":1632,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"mike_casazza@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Wildlife Biologist","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"L","lastName":"Casazza","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Dixon Field Station, WERC"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"7076785039","officePhone":"5306695075","streetAddress":{"zip":"95620","city":"Dixon","state":"CA","line1":"800 Business Park Drive"},"buildingCode":"WDR","name":"Michael L Casazza\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

Remote sensing data are a powerful tool to help delineate available wetland habitat to assess progress towards conservation objectives within a management year and to measure the effect of drought, as well as other drivers, on wetland availability. New and ongoing research is quantifying how the spatio-temporal patterns of wetland habitat availability in the Central Valley (San Joaquin River and Sacramento River Basins; Point Blue and NDVI, USFWS). Understanding these habitat dynamics, particularly during drought, will improve the precision of the bioenergetics models in the Central Valley; TRUEMET (Central Valley Joint Venture 2006) and SWAMP (Miller et al. 2014). But knowing where food resources are may not be completely sufficient if bird behavior influences bird distribution and make food resources differentially \u201cavailable\u201d. Decision processes made by individual waterfowl may also have synergistic effects with particular habitat dynamic patterns (e.g., spatial density dependence). We propose a two phase project to better understand the impact of drought on waterbirds and increase the utility of dynamic habitat mapping projects by integrating with concurrently collected near real-time waterfowl movement data to inform parameter space in landscape (TRUEMET) and agent-based (SWAMP) bioenergetics models. In Phase I, we will (1) conduct model analysis to identify how drought influences available wetland habitat types and the duration and extent of flooding, (2) evaluate changes in waterbird food energy supplies using TRUEMET with parameters derived from the classified wetland data developed above to assess impact of changing wetland availability as the result of drought on meeting waterfowl and shorebird conservation objectives, and (3) implement the tested classification algorithms to calculate wetland and energy availability at different scales from automated classifications of Landsat 8 satellite data as an ongoing assessment of drought, water management decisions, and subsequent impacts on wetlands and waterbird habitat. In Phase II, we will use kernel and change\u2010point utilization distributions (CPUDs [Overton 2014]) heuristic and statistical (e.g, logistic regression) analysis methods to link bird movement data combined with habitat data to develop the necessary movement metrics that will inform agent-based (SWAMP) and landscape (TRUEMET) bioenergetics models to assess impacts of drought conditions. Decision on optimal allocation and management of water resources must consider multiple wildlife objectives, including but not limited to habitat objectives for waterfowl, shorebirds, and other waterbirds. Additional information on responsiveness of waterfowl and shorebirds to water allocation and management decisions will help evaluate the effectiveness of water management practices intended to provide adequate wetland habitat for waterbirds.\r\n\r\nProducts developed as part of this work will include Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data layers for the entire Central Valley for April through 2000 \u2013 2011; classification heuristic for delineating wetland types (irrigated seasonal, non-irrigated, semi-permanent) based on inundation frequency and NDVI indices to represent irrigation; model and analysis quantifying the effect of drought on wetland composition, as well as water inundation frequency and duration in the Central Valley; evaluation of the effect of drought on food availability for waterfowl and shorebirds by integrating modeled wetland type, water abundance and irrigation information with the TRUMET bioenergetics model; application of the classification heuristic to track wetland type and extent over time using Landsat 8 data; integration of Landsat 8 wetland tracking with movement data on ducks marked with satellite transmitters to develop parameters for SWAMP model . Information developed as part of this project will be made available via a webpage.

By using canonical correlation analysis applied to daily maximum temperatures and morbidity data in the form of unscheduled hospitalizations from 1999 to 2009, 19 heat waves spanning 3\u201315 days in duration that had a significant impact on health were identified. On average, hospital admissions were found to increase by 7% on the peak heat-wave day, with a significant impact seen for several disease categories, including cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, dehydration, acute renal failure, heat illness, and mental health. Statewide, there were 11 000 excess hospitalizations that were due to extreme heat over the period, yet the majority of impactful events were not accompanied by a heat advisory or warning from the National Weather Service. On a regional basis, the strongest health impacts are seen in the Central Valley and the north and south coasts. The north coast contributes disproportionately to the statewide health impact during heat waves, with a 10.5% increase in daily morbidity at heat-wave peak as compared with 8.1% for the Central Valley and 5.6% for the south coast. The temperature threshold at which an impact is seen varies by subregion and timing within the season. These results suggest that heat-warning criteria should consider local percentile thresholds to account for acclimation to local climatological conditions as well as the seasonal timing of a forecast heat wave.","parentId":"502bdd9be4b098307cc38b6f","contacts":[{"name":"Kristen Guirguis","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alexander Gershunov","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alexander Tardy","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"NOAA\/National Weather Service"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Rupa Basu","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"California Environmental Protection Agency"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/journals.ametsoc.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1175\/JAMC-D-13-0130.1","title":"Guirguis et al., 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"temperature"},{"name":"emergency preparedness"},{"name":"planning"},{"name":"regional effects"},{"name":"societal impacts"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-01","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-03-17T09:42:47.208-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-26T09:25:47.148-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"American Meteorological Society","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI Number","value":"doi: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1175\/JAMC-D-13-0130.1"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Southwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e","people":["Kristen Guirguis","Alexander Gershunov","Alexander Tardy","Rupa Basu"],"orgs":["Southwest CSC"]},"51e44ca8e4b08262df3d63f5":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"51e44ca8e4b08262df3d63f5","title":"The Influence of the North Pacific Jet on Fire in California","body":"<div>\n  In California, increased wildfire activity has been linked to decreasing snowpack and earlier snowmelt. Not only has this translated into a longer fire season, but reduced snowpack has cascading effects that impact streamflow, water supplies, agricultural productivity, and ecosystems. California receives 80% of its precipitation during the winter, so mountain snowpack plays a critical role in replenishing the state\u2019s water supply.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> One factor that affects the amount of winter precipitation (and therefore snowpack) in California is the North Pacific Jet (NPJ)\u2014a current of strong, high altitude winds that occur over the northern Pacific Ocean. Winters when the NPJ is located further north than normal are drier than average in California, while winters when the NPJ is located further south are wetter. Climate change is expected to cause the position of the NPJ to become more variable, which could greatly influence California\u2019s water resources and ecosystems.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> The goal of this project is to identify the relationship between the NPJ and wildfires in California. Researchers will first use tree-ring data to examine variability in the position of the NPJ over the past 400+ years to identify historical trends. They will then use historical fire data to determine how the NPJ has influenced wildfire patterns in the past. Finally, researchers will look at recent fire data to see if this historical relationship between the NPJ and fire holds true in the 21\n <sup>st<\/sup> century.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> By documenting the relationship between the NPJ and wildfires, this project will enable fire managers to better forecast future fire conditions, based on projected trends in the NPJ. Improving forecasting ability is critical to successful fire preparedness and accurate anticipation of fire suppression budgets. \n<\/div>","purpose":"The position of the North Pacific Jet (NPJ), a high altitude narrow path of strong winds over the North Pacific Ocean, is a key determinant of snowpack variability in California (CA): winters when the NPJ is located more southerly (northerly) than normal are therefore wetter (drier) than average in CA. With ongoing and future climatic change, the NPJ is projected to slow down and exhibit a more north-south oriented trajectory, which could greatly influence CA water resources and ecosystems. In this project, researchers propose to use tree-ring data to reconstruct NPJ variability over the last 400+ years. This reconstruction will allow the team to put current NPJ trends in a historical perspective and to study the occurrence of NPJ periodicity and extremes. Researchers will then use historical fire data (1500-1900 CE) to look at NPJ influence on CA fire regimes and will analyze recent annual area burned data to investigate whether the NPJ-fire relationship persists into the 21st century. The research team anticipates that this research will be relevant as input to seasonal outlooks which incorporate past, present, and future climate and fuels information to anticipate significant fire potential. The outlooks are designed to inform decision makers for proactive wildland fire management.

We analyze climate model projected changes in the number of dry days using 28 coupled global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, version 5 (CMIP5). We find that the Mediterranean Sea region, parts of Central and South America, and western Indonesia could experience up to 30 more dry days per year by the end of this century. We illustrate how changes in the number of dry days and the precipitation intensity on precipitating days combine to produce changes in annual precipitation, and show that over much of the subtropics the change in number of dry days dominates the annual changes in precipitation and accounts for a large part of the change in interannual precipitation variability.","parentId":"50475a83e4b067bd38f7f487","contacts":[{"name":"Nature Publishing Group","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Suraj Polade","type":"Author","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"David Pierce","type":"Author","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Daniel R Cayan","oldPartyId":1669,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"drcayan@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Oceanographer","firstName":"Daniel","middleName":"R","lastName":"Cayan","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Branch of Regional Research, Western Region"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8585348561","officePhone":"8585344507","streetAddress":{"zip":"92093","country":"US","city":"La Jolla","state":"CA","line1":"Scripps Inst.

Throughout the region, CLC is greatest during May\u2013September but has considerable monthly variability within this summer season. On average, June is cloudiest along the coast of southern California and northern Baja, Mexico, while July is cloudiest along northern California's coast. Over the course of the summer, the core of peak CLC migrates northward along coastal California, reaching its northernmost extent in late July\/early August, then recedes while weakening. The timing and movement of the CLC climatological structure is related to the summer evolution of lower tropospheric stability and both its component parts, sea surface temperature and potential temperature at 700\u2009hPa. The roughly coincident seasonal timing of peak CLC with peak summertime temperatures translates into the strongest heat-modulating capacity of CLC along California's north coast.","parentId":"544e94bee4b0240906891311","contacts":[{"name":"Rachel E.

Results indicate that when aggregating data annually, most locations are to be considered heavy tailed with statistical significance. When aggregating data by season, it becomes evident that the thickness of the probability tail is related to the variability in precipitation causing events and thus that the fundamental cause of precipitation volatility is weather diversity. These results have both theoretical and practical implications for the modeling of high-frequency climate variability worldwide.","parentId":"522516d0e4b0e4746d62afb1","contacts":[{"name":"Nicholas R.

The measures examined include the water content of the spring snowpack, total cold-season snowfall, fraction of winter precipitation that falls as snow, length of the snow season, and fraction of cold-season precipitation retained in the spring snowpack, as well as temperature and precipitation. Various stakeholders may be interested in different sets of these variables. It is found that temperature and the fraction of winter precipitation that falls as snow exhibit significant trends first, followed in 5\u201310 years by the fraction of cold-season precipitation retained in the spring snowpack, and later still by the water content of the spring snowpack. Change in total cold-season snowfall is least detectable of all the measures, since it is strongly linked to precipitation, which has large natural variability and only a weak anthropogenic trend in the western United States. Averaging over increasingly wider areas monotonically increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the 1950\u20132025 linear trend from 0.15 to 0.37, depending on the snow measure.","parentId":"502bdd9be4b098307cc38b6f","contacts":[{"name":"David W Pierce","oldPartyId":51491,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.","firstName":"David","middleName":"W","lastName":"Pierce","organization":{"displayText":"Scripps Institution of Oceanography"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Daniel R Cayan","oldPartyId":1669,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"drcayan@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Oceanographer","firstName":"Daniel","middleName":"R","lastName":"Cayan","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Branch of Regional Research, Western Region"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"8585348561","officePhone":"8585344507","streetAddress":{"zip":"92093","country":"US","city":"La Jolla","state":"CA","line1":"Scripps Inst.

This study will analyze the impact of climate change on wildfires, and assess where and when plant communities are predicted to exhibit stress as a consequence of unusual climatic conditions. Understanding fire behavior probabilities and forest vulnerabilities will provide decision support for the deployment of fuels management (prescribed fire and mechanical fuels reduction), as well as for appropriate management responses to wildfire events. Moreover, an understanding of how vegetation is likely to change with climate will allow proactive land management decisions to guide forested ecosystems toward stable, functioning future states.","parentId":"5007050de4b0abf7ce733fda","contacts":[{"name":"Mark W.

Managers are faced with identifying where, when, and how to allocate their limited resources to ensure maximal effect when addressing emerging and evolving societal concerns about climate change. Forecasts of species biodiversity can provide managers with prospective identities and locations of species that are likely to be at future risk because of climate change. This research will address questions related to the use of species distribution models in predicting species\u2019 vulnerability to climate change. The project will also examine the connections between factors affecting species variation and species\u2019 characteristics, the relations between species-specific distribution forecasts and published vulnerability assessments, and the vulnerability of bird and reptile species to forecasted climate change in the southwestern U.S.&nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"5007050de4b0abf7ce733fda","contacts":[{"name":"Barbara Ralston","oldPartyId":8388,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"bralston@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Supervisory Biologist \/ Deputy Center Director","firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Ralston","organization":{"displayText":"Southwest Biological Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9285567092","streetAddress":{"zip":"86001-1637","country":"US","city":"Flagstaff","state":"AZ","line1":"2255 North Gemini Drive"},"buildingCode":"WZD","name":"Barbara Ralston\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"86001","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"9395","city":"Flagstaff","state":"AZ","line1":"2255 North Gemini Drive, Mail Stop 9395"},"building":"Building 4 & 5"}},{"name":"Matthew J.

Output from all general circulation models (GCMs) in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project archive is downscaled to 2-km resolution over the region. Variables pertaining to snow are analyzed for the middle (2041\u201360) and end (2081\u20132100) of the twenty-first century under two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP8.5 (business as usual) and RCP2.6 (mitigation). These four sets of projections are compared with a baseline reconstruction of climate from 1981 to 2000. For both future time slices and scenarios, ensemble-mean total winter snowfall loss is widespread. By the mid-twenty-first century under RCP8.5, ensemble-mean winter snowfall is about 70% of baseline, whereas the corresponding value for RCP2.6 is somewhat higher (about 80% of baseline). By the end of the century, however, the two scenarios diverge significantly. Under RCP8.5, snowfall sees a dramatic further decline; 2081\u20132100 totals are only about half of baseline totals. Under RCP2.6, only a negligible further reduction from midcentury snowfall totals is seen. Because of the spread in the GCM climate projections, these figures are all associated with large intermodel uncertainty. Snowpack on the ground, as represented by 1 April snow water equivalent is also assessed. Because of enhanced snowmelt, the loss seen in snowpack is generally 50% greater than that seen in winter snowfall. By midcentury under RCP8.5, warming-accelerated spring snowmelt leads to snow-free dates that are about 1\u20133 weeks earlier than in the baseline period.","parentId":"50475a83e4b067bd38f7f487","contacts":[{"name":"Fengpeng Sun","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of California, Los Angeles"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Alex Hall","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of California, Los Angeles"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Marla Schwartz","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of California, Los Angeles"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Daniel B.Walton","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of California, Los Angeles"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Neil Berg","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of California, Los Angeles"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southwest CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/journals.ametsoc.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1175\/JCLI-D-15-0199.1","title":"Sun et al. 2016","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"snowfall"},{"name":"snowpack"},{"name":"climate models"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2016-01","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-01-29T11:39:37.881-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-01-29T11:44:05.196-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Journal of Climate","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1175\/JCLI-D-15-0199.1"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Volume","value":"29"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Issue","value":"1"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Pages","value":"91-110"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Southwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e","people":["Fengpeng Sun","Alex Hall","Marla Schwartz","Daniel B.Walton","Neil Berg"],"orgs":["Southwest CSC"]},"56059204e4b058f706e514b0":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5012a813e4b05140039e02d1","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Vegetation data for Southwest Forest Vulnerability Index","relatedTitle":"The Vulnerability of Forests to Climate Change and Wildfire in the Southwestern U.S.","id":"56059204e4b058f706e514b0","relatedId":"5012a813e4b05140039e02d1","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/56059204e4b058f706e514b0","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"The Vulnerability of Forests to Climate Change and Wildfire in the Southwestern U.S.","relatedTitle":"Vegetation data for Southwest Forest Vulnerability Index","id":"5012a813e4b05140039e02d1","relatedId":"56059204e4b058f706e514b0","annotation":null}]},"id":"56059204e4b058f706e514b0","title":"Vegetation data for Southwest Forest Vulnerability Index","body":"Derived from the LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation data (http:\/\/www.landfire.gov\/vegetation.php).

This raster can be used as an index of the vegetation type being modeled at each location.","purpose":"Vegetation data used in the development of the Southwest Forest Vulnerability Index.","parentId":"5047633be4b067bd38f7f4aa","contacts":[{"name":"Mark Schwartz","type":"Point of Contact","contactType":"person","email":"mwschwartz@ucdavis.edu","organization":{"displayText":"UC-Davis"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Data"],"browseTypes":["Downloadable","Raster","GeoTIFF"],"tags":[{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"landfire"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"vegetation"},{"type":"Theme","scheme":"None","name":"southwest"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-09-25T12:27:16.218-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-10-09T13:11:15.634-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":6580024,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-09-25T18:26:04.000Z","name":"landfire_veg_sw_300m.tif.zip","pathOnDisk":"__disk__1b\/3c\/b4\/1b3cb4528c2f183e170221cb7fd2d2fd78c1b036","title":"","contentType":"application\/zip","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/56059204e4b058f706e514b0?f=__disk__1b%2F3c%2Fb4%2F1b3cb4528c2f183e170221cb7fd2d2fd78c1b036"},{"originalMetadata":true,"processed":false,"size":4359,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2015-09-25T18:26:42.000Z","name":"landfire_veg.fgdc.xml","pathOnDisk":"__disk__35\/f6\/54\/35f654cd9277458536a3f4665d9a58a9c8f3a87a","title":"","contentType":"application\/fgdc+xml","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/56059204e4b058f706e514b0?f=__disk__35%2Ff6%2F54%2F35f654cd9277458536a3f4665d9a58a9c8f3a87a"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/56059204e4b058f706e514b0","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"Vegetationdataf.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Southwest CSC","parent_id":"4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e","people":["Mark Schwartz"]},"5447c244e4b0f888a81b8378":{"relationships":{"total":4,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5012a99be4b05140039e02e5","rel":"alternate of","relatedRel":"alternate","title":"Year-round Migrations of the Cui-ui and Lahontan Cutthroat Trout in Pyramid Lake","relatedTitle":"Climate Change Vulnerability of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe in the Southwest","id":"5447c244e4b0f888a81b8378","relatedId":"5012a99be4b05140039e02e5","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5012a99be4b05140039e02e5","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Year-round Migrations of the Cui-ui and Lahontan Cutthroat Trout in Pyramid Lake","relatedTitle":"Climate Change Vulnerability of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe in the Southwest","id":"5447c244e4b0f888a81b8378","relatedId":"5012a99be4b05140039e02e5","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5447c244e4b0f888a81b8378","rel":"alternate","relatedRel":"alternate of","title":"Climate Change Vulnerability of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe in the Southwest","relatedTitle":"Year-round Migrations of the Cui-ui and Lahontan Cutthroat Trout in Pyramid Lake","id":"5012a99be4b05140039e02e5","relatedId":"5447c244e4b0f888a81b8378","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5447c244e4b0f888a81b8378","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Climate Change Vulnerability of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe in the Southwest","relatedTitle":"Year-round Migrations of the Cui-ui and Lahontan Cutthroat Trout in Pyramid Lake","id":"5012a99be4b05140039e02e5","relatedId":"5447c244e4b0f888a81b8378","annotation":null}]},"id":"5447c244e4b0f888a81b8378","title":"Year-round Migrations of the Cui-ui and Lahontan Cutthroat Trout in Pyramid Lake","body":"This presentation provides an overview of the year-round migrations of the Cui-ui and Lahontan cutthroat trout within Pyramid Lake.

The purpose of this project is to develop a spatially explicit, probabilistic model of coastal response for the Northeastern U.S. to a variety of sea-level scenarios that take into account the variable nature of the coast and provides outputs at spatial and temporal scales suitable for decision support. Model results provide predictions of adjusted land elevation ranges (AE) with respect to forecast sea-levels, a likelihood estimate of this outcome (PAE), and a probability of coastal response (CR) characterized as either static or dynamic. The predictions span the coastal zone vertically from -12 meters (m) to 10 m above mean high water (MHW). Results are produced at a horizontal resolution of 30 meters for four decades (the 2020s, 2030s, 2050s and 2080s). Adjusted elevations and their respective probabilities are generated using regional geospatial datasets of current sea-level forecasts, vertical land movement rates, and current elevation data. Coastal response type predictions incorporate adjusted elevation predictions with land cover data and expert knowledge to determine the likelihood that an area will be able to accommodate or adapt to water level increases and maintain its initial land class state or transition to a new non-submerged state (dynamic) or become submerged (static). Intended users of these data include scientific researchers, coastal planners, and natural resource management communities.","purpose":"These GIS layers provide the probability of observing a static vs. dynamic coastal response (CR) with respect to predicted sea-level rise for the Northeastern U.S. for the 2020s, 2030s, 2050s and 2080s. These data are based on the following inputs: sea-level rise, vertical land movement rates due to glacial isostatic adjustment, elevation data, and land cover data. The output displays a probability based on binary end members for the forecast year as defined by a probabilistic framework (a Bayesian network). Because the static vs dynamic coastal response is a binary relationship, the dynamic (i.e. landform or landscape change) coastal response can be derived by subtracting the static response from 1 (and vice versa). These data layers primarily show the distribution of likely coastal response types over a large spatial scale and should therefore be used qualitatively (see Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report).","materialRequestInstructions":"30 meter Esri binary grids of coastal response type probabilities with respect to projected sea levels for the Northeastern U.S. from Maine to Virginia for the 2020s, 2030s, 2050s and 2080s (Albers, NAD 83)","parentId":"50538a9fe4b097cd4fce2e7a","contacts":[{"name":"E.

the landscape to evaluate where coastal land will be available for future use. The purpose of this project is to develop a spatially explicit, probabilistic model of coastal response for the Northeastern U.S. to a variety of sea-level scenarios that take into account the variable nature of the coast and provides outputs at spatial and temporal scales suitable for decision support. Model results provide predictions of adjusted land elevation ranges (AE) with respect to forecast sea-levels, a likelihood estimate of this outcome (PAE), and a probability of coastal response (CR) characterized as either static or dynamic. The predictions span the coastal zone vertically from -12 meters (m) to 10 m above mean high water (MHW). Results are produced at a horizontal resolution of 30 meters for four decades (the 2020s, 2030s, 2050s and 2080s). Adjusted elevations and their respective probabilities are generated using regional geospatial datasets of current sea-level forecasts, vertical land movement rates, and current elevation data. Coastal response type predictions incorporate adjusted elevation predictions with land cover data and expert knowledge to determine the likelihood that an area will be able to accommodate or adapt to water level increases and maintain its initial land class state or transition to a new non-submerged state (dynamic) or become submerged (static). Intended users of these data include scientific researchers, coastal planners, and natural resource management communities.","purpose":"These GIS layers provide the probability of observing the forecast of adjusted land elevation (PAE) with respect to predicted sea-level rise or the Northeastern U.S. for the 2020s, 2030s, 2050s and 2080s. Thes data are based on the following inputs: sea-level rise, vertical land movement rates due to glacial isostatic adjustment and elevation data. The output displays the highest probability among the five adjusted elevation ranges (-12 to -1, -1 to 0, 0 to 1, 1 to 5, and 5 to 10 m) to be observed for the forecast year as defined by a probabilistic framework (a Bayesian network), and should be used concurrently with the adjusted land elevation layer (AE), also available from http:\/\/woodshole.er.usgs.gov\/project-pages\/coastal_response\/, which provides users with the forecast elevation range occurring when compared with the four other elevation ranges. These data layers primarily show the distribution of adjusted elevation range probabilities over a large spatial scale and should therefore be used qualitatively (see Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report).","materialRequestInstructions":"30 meter Esri binary grids of probability of predicted elevation with respect to projected sea levels for the Northeastern U.S. from Maine to Virginia for the 2020s, 2030s, 2050s and 2080s (Albers, NAD 83)","parentId":"50538a9fe4b097cd4fce2e7a","contacts":[{"name":"E.

rise on barrier island groundwater system dynamics \u2013 ecohydrological implications","body":"Abstract:&nbsp; We used a numerical model to investigate how a barrier island groundwater system responds to increases of up to 60 cm in sea level. We found that a sea-level rise of 20 cm leads to substantial changes in the depth of the water table and the extent and depth of saltwater intrusion, which are key determinants in the establishment, distribution and succession of vegetation assemblages and habitat suitability in barrier islands ecosystems. In our simulations, increases in water-table height in areas with a shallow depth to water (or thin vadose zone) resulted in extensive groundwater inundation of land surface and a thinning of the underlying freshwater lens. We demonstrated the interdependence of the groundwater response to island morphology by evaluating changes at three sites. This interdependence can have a profound effect on ecosystem composition in these fragile coastal landscapes under long-term changing climatic conditions. Published 2013.

Sea-level-rise scenarios used as model inputs are generated by using multiple sources of information, including Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models following representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5 in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. A Bayesian network is used to develop a predictive coastal response model that integrates the sea-level, elevation, and land-cover data with assigned probabilities that account for interactions with coastal geomorphology as well as the corresponding ecological and societal systems it supports. The effects of sea-level rise are presented as (1) level of landscape submergence and (2) coastal response type characterized as either static (that is, inundation) or dynamic (that is, landform or landscape change). Results are produced at a spatial scale of 30 meters for four decades (the 2020s, 2030s, 2050s, and 2080s). The probabilistic predictions can be applied to landscape management decisions based on sea-level-rise effects as well as on assessments of the prediction uncertainty and need for improved data or fundamental understanding. This report describes the methods used to produce predictions, including information on input datasets; the modeling approach; model outputs; data-quality-control procedures; and information on how to access the data and metadata online.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50538aa3e4b097cd4fce2ea2"],"contacts":[{"name":"Erika E.

We develop a probabilistic model that evaluates the likelihood that an area will inundate (flood) or dynamically respond (adapt) to SLR. The broad-area applicability of the approach is demonstrated by producing 30 \u00d7 30\u2009m resolution predictions for more than 38,000\u2009km2 of diverse coastal landscape in the northeastern United States. Probabilistic SLR projections, coastal elevation and vertical land movement are used to estimate likely future inundation levels. Then, conditioned on future inundation levels and the current land-cover type, we evaluate the likelihood of dynamic response versus inundation. We find that nearly 70% of this coastal landscape has some capacity to respond dynamically to SLR, and we show that inundation models over-predict land likely to submerge. This approach is well suited to guiding coastal resource management decisions that weigh future SLR impacts and uncertainty against ecological targets and economic constraints.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50538aa3e4b097cd4fce2ea2"],"contacts":[{"name":"Erika E.

Contributions from ice sheets and ocean dynamics are increasingly well-understood, and global budgets better constrained. In addition to physically-based models, semi-empirical methods, and more recently expert elicitations, are also available to describe potential SLR. In spite of these advances, there is still large uncertainty in the magnitude and timing of SLR over the next century and beyond. How much and how fast sea-level may rise can be a significant determinant of management actions in both natural and built environments. Assessing the potential vulnerability of the coastal zone to SLR requires integrating a variety of physical, biological, and social factors. A variety of approaches to SLR planning can be used, such as probabilistic assessments, alternative scenarios, and analogs to past conditions.","parentId":"50538aa3e4b097cd4fce2ea2","contacts":[{"name":"E.

These include landscape, habitat, and resource changes, as well as the ability of society and its institutions to adapt. The range of physical and biological responses associated with SLR is poorly understood at some of the critical time and space scales required for decision making. Limitations in the ability to quantitatively predict outcomes at local, regional, and national scales affect whether, when, and how some decisions will be made. The USGS and collaborators are developing scientific knowledge and tools to understand and anticipate the magnitude and likelihood of future SLR impacts. Recent work to develop probabilistic frameworks that capture potential outcomes and communicate scientific uncertainty shows great promise as a means to engage both scientists and decision makers in the development of decision tools, as well as to inform science activities that will result in more useful predictions and products for management. Examples include shoreline change, coastal landscape evolution, barrier island groundwater resources, and piping plover habitat.","parentId":"50538aa3e4b097cd4fce2ea2","contacts":[{"name":"E.

Climate change is anticipated to alter the current thermal patterns in riparian ecosystems and will have implications for these organisms. A water temperature change of 1 or 2 \u00b0C may have severe consequences for aquatic species, specifically coldwater fishes. Monitoring and modeling of stream temperature regimes is critical to assessing the vulnerability of coldwater species under the impacts of climate change in the Northeast United States. This research reviews the literature on existing stream temperature models for applicability over varying spatial and temporal scales. Collection of existing stream temperature data in the Northeast into one consistent format for analysis in stream temperature models was completed. Other efforts include the evaluation of three models for effectiveness across a large spatial scale, the deployment of temperature loggers based on previous spatial stream network coverage with the purpose of coarse and fine-grain monitoring, and the application of models to basins in the Northeast to study climate change impacts on stream temperature and identify watershed characteristics that lead to resilient stream temperatures.","parentId":"50538acbe4b097cd4fce2f3f","contacts":[{"name":"Kyle O'Neil","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Austin Polebitski","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Yi-Chen E.

Such change can have significant ecological implications for the health of riparian systems. It is important for decision-makers to understand the impact of various physical characteristics on the stream temperature regime in a watershed. This research applies a statistical stream temperature model (Mohseni et al, 1998) to 905 sites across the northeastern United States to determine if such models can be useful to resource managers. Statistical analysis on the calibrated model parameters across the best-fit sites is used to provide information on watershed characteristics which may be critical to stream temperature. In addition to air temperature, which is the obvious driver of stream temperature, groundwater influence, forest coverage, urban area, and drainage area, which is representative of travel time, are the most significant watershed characteristics that impact stream temperature. While the relationships between forested and urban landscapes and stream temperature generated in this research confirm past research, a definitive relationship between groundwater and stream temperature was not established. A predictive model of stream temperature is also developed, extending the work of Mohseni et al. (1998). This model uses watershed characteristics and meteorological data to generate stream temperatures at an ungaged location. Uses of this model include analyzing the impacts of anthropogenic changes on stream temperature regimes and the generation of realistic stream temperatures at a location for use in another model, such as the physical stream temperature model developed by Yearsley (2011). Results from the predictive model are comparable to those from the calibrated nonlinear stream temperature model analyzed. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;","parentId":"50538acbe4b097cd4fce2f3f","contacts":[{"name":"Kyle O\u2019Neil","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2013-07","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-10-23T13:15:03.080-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-10-23T13:15:03.080-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2013","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-10-23T13:15:03.080-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-10-23T13:15:03.080-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Master's Thesis","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":2160443,"dateUploaded":"2015-10-23T19:13:18.000Z","name":"ONeil_FINAL_THESIS.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__fb\/93\/c5\/fb93c550baed5b2d61df316ff3d3378cd36b9b24","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/562a8737e4b0016252220671?f=__disk__fb%2F93%2Fc5%2Ffb93c550baed5b2d61df316ff3d3378cd36b9b24"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/562a8737e4b0016252220671","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"BringingPeople_.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c648de4b0546c0c397b43","people":["Kyle O\u2019Neil"],"orgs":["Northeast CSC"],"children":[]},"562a8a21e4b0016252220678":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/50070ce0e4b0abf7ce73400f","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Northeast Climate Science Center Stream Temperature Project Update","relatedTitle":"Bringing People, Data, and Models Together \u2013 Addressing Impacts of Climate Change on Stream Temperature","id":"562a8a21e4b0016252220678","relatedId":"50070ce0e4b0abf7ce73400f","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/562a8a21e4b0016252220678","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Bringing People, Data, and Models Together \u2013 Addressing Impacts of Climate Change on Stream Temperature","relatedTitle":"Northeast Climate Science Center Stream Temperature Project Update","id":"50070ce0e4b0abf7ce73400f","relatedId":"562a8a21e4b0016252220678","annotation":null}]},"id":"562a8a21e4b0016252220678","title":"Northeast Climate Science Center Stream Temperature Project Update","body":"The&nbsp;Stream Temperature Data and Modeling Meeting II was help on May 1, 2014.

In this study, three stream temperature models were implemented for two different case-study basins in the Northeast Climate Science Center region. Two coupled hydrology-stream temperature (physical) models were used: VIC-RBM and SWAT-Ficklin et al. (2012). The third model implemented was a nonlinear regression (statistical) model developed by Mohseni et al. (1998). Metrics were developed to assess these models regarding their prediction skill, data input requirements, spatial and temporal resolutions, and \u201cuser-friendliness.\u201d This comprehensive assessment will be employed by aquatic resource managers in need of projected stream temperatures for management decisions in the face of climate change. Additionally, these models were used to predict stream temperatures under a range of future air temperature and precipitation scenarios for the study basins. These basins were the Westfield Basin (1,338 km2) in western Massachusetts and the Milwaukee Basin (2,220 km2) in Wisconsin. The climate change analysis was performed using a range of potential precipitation changes and air temperature increases (similar to a climate stress test). Precipitation scenarios ranged from 90% of observed to 130% of observed (in increments of 10%) and daily air temperature increases ranged from 0&deg; C to 7&deg; C (in increments of 1&deg; C); the combinations of 5 precipitation scenarios and 8 air temperature scenarios yielded 40 different climate scenarios that were evaluated by each model. The impacts of climate change on these temperature and precipitation ranges was determined for the two watersheds and during specific seasons of the year.","parentId":"50538acbe4b097cd4fce2f3f","contacts":[{"name":"Lynn Brennan","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts -

Data","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/00028487.2016.1150879):&nbsp;Long-term sampling of fisheries data is an important source of information for making inferences about the temporal dynamics of populations that support ecologically and economically important fisheries. For example, time series of catch-per-effort data are often examined for the presence of long-term trends. However, it is also of interest to know whether certain sampled locations are exhibiting temporal patterns that deviate from the overall pattern exhibited across all sampled locations. Patterns at these \u201cunusual\u201d sites may be the result of site-specific abiotic (e.g., habitat) or biotic (e.g., the presence of an invasive species) factors that cause these sites to respond differently to natural or anthropogenic drivers of population dynamics or to management actions. We present a Bayesian model selection approach that allows for detection of unique sites\u2014locations that display temporal patterns with documentable inconsistencies relative to the overall global average temporal pattern. We applied this modeling approach to long-term gill-net data collected from a fixed-site, standardized sampling program for Yellow Perch&nbsp;<em>Perca flavescens<\/em>&nbsp;in Oneida Lake, New York, but the approach is also relevant to shorter time series data. We used this approach to identify six sites with distinct temporal patterns that differed from the lakewide trend, and we describe the magnitude of the difference between these patterns and the lakewide average trend. Detection of unique sites may be informative for management decisions related to prioritizing rehabilitation or restoration efforts, stocking, or determining fishable areas and for further understanding changes in ecosystem dynamics.","parentId":"50538aede4b097cd4fce2f4a","contacts":[{"name":"Tyler Wagner","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS, Pennsylvania Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Stephen R.

These mapping projects represent a major step forward in describing the&nbsp;current extent&nbsp;of ecosystems across the landscape, and provide resource management agencies and&nbsp;organizations with unprecedented access to spatial information on these systems.&nbsp;In a number of cases, the ranges of these maps overlap. As a result, staff of resource management&nbsp;agencies and organizations are faced with trying to determine how to use multiple products&nbsp;to effectively and efficiently meet their needs. To address this question in the Northeast and&nbsp;Midwest U.S., the NE CSC funded a project to critically&nbsp;evaluate these ecosystem and habitat mapping methods and to move toward standardization of&nbsp;these maps.&nbsp;The objectives of this project were to: (1)&nbsp;review and compare existing map products; (2)&nbsp;extend the map legends and identify legend elements (such as ecosystems) most&nbsp;vulnerable to climate change; (3)&nbsp;develop recommendations for an improved map for the region; and (4)&nbsp;produce an improved regional map for the Northeast and Midwest.<\/p>

Interaction Indicators of Climate Change for the Great Lakes","body":"<p>In Lake Erie and in large embayments throughout the Great Lakes basin, climate change is a concern for fishery managers, as it may worsen oxygen levels and reduce habitat for some fish species.&nbsp;This project examined regional climate change effects on aquatic food webs in the Great Lakes. Project scientists examined Lake Erie as a representative system with a high level of human impact, varying levels of food availability, seasonal hypoxia (low oxygen levels), and spatial overlap of cold- and cool-water fish. Researchers examined fish community composition, fine-scale distribution, food availability, diets, and other factors from study areas with medium-high nutrient levels (Fairport study area)&nbsp;and low nutrient levels (Erie study area). This multi-year database (2011-2013) provides the ability to contrast years with wide variation in rainfall, winter ice-cover, and thermal stratification. In addition, multiple indicators of dietary and distributional responses to environmental variability will allow resource managers to select the most informative approach for addressing specific climate change questions. The researcher\u2019s results support the incorporation of some relatively simple and cost-efficient approaches into existing agency monitoring programs to track the near-term condition of fish and fish community composition by functional groupings. For example, this study found that fish tended to aggregate at the edges of hypoxia, highlighting potential spatial changes in catch efficiency for the fishery.<br>\n<br>\nThis work has had several positive impacts on a wide range of resource management and stakeholder activities, most notably in Lake Erie. The results were instrumental in the development of an interim decision rule for dealing with data collected during hypoxic events to improve stock assessment of Yellow Perch. In addition, novel findings from this study regarding spatial and temporal variability in hypoxia have aided the US-Environmental Protection Agency in the development of a modified sampling protocol to more accurately quantify the central basin hypoxic zone, and this directly addressed a goal of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 2012 to reduce the extent and severity of hypoxia. Finally, the study areas developed in this project formed the basis for food web sampling in the 2014 bi-national Coordinated Science and Monitoring Initiative work in Lake Erie.<\/p>\n","purpose":"It is predicted that climate change, which can result in increased temperature, eutrophication (the occurrence of excessive nutrients in a body of water), and changes to freshwater inputs, will alter food web dynamics and consequently the sustainability of fish populations in the Great Lakes, which provide significant multi-national fishery resources.  This project will evaluate aquatic food web structures as indicators of climate change to determine which fish species are most at risk. Analyses in the study will include 1) examination of the distribution of dominant prey and predator fishes, 2) variability in diet and food web position of fishes related to seasonal-driven habitat changes and 3) seasonal environmental variability as related to long-term climate change. Results will be used to serve management agency needs to adaptively maintain sustainable large lake fisheries.

benthic macroinvertebrates, and zooplankton) between the Lake Erie Central Basin and the Lake Erie Eastern Basin, 2011-2013","body":"Lake Erie Biological Station (LEBS), located in Sandusky, Ohio, is a field station of the USGS Great Lakes Science Center (GLSC). LEBS is the primary federal agency for applied fisheries science excellence in Lake Erie. From 2011-2013, LEBS carried out a project which addressed the effects of regional climate change on aquatic food webs in the Great Lakes. This study focused on Lake Erie, as it is a representative system with a high level of anthropogenic impacts, strong nutrient gradients, seasonal hypoxia, and spatial overlap of cold- and cool-water fish guilds. In Lake Erie and in large embayments throughout the Great Lakes basin, this situation is a concern for fishery managers, as climate change may exacerbate hypoxia and reduce habitat volume for some species. We examined fish community composition, fine-scale distribution, prey availability, diets, and biochemical tracers for dominant fishes from study areas with medium-high nutrient levels (mesotrophic, Fairport study area), and low nutrient levels (oligotrophic, Erie study area). This multi-year database (2011-2013) provides the ability to contrast years with wide variation in rainfall, winter ice-cover, and thermal stratification. In addition, multiple indicators of dietary and distributional responses to environmental variability will allow resource managers to select the most informative approach for addressing specific climate change questions.","purpose":"This data is intended for use by Lake Erie fisheries  managers, academia, the fishing industry, and the public. This novel data on Lake Erie ecosystems has already informed important decisions by state, federal, and provincial managers in the Great Lakes. Specifically, our analysis of fish distribution with respect to hypoxia has informed a decision rule on the inclusion of stock assessment data for annual development of fishery quotas. This work also aided US-EPA in the development of a robust bi-national food web investigation through the Coordinated Science and Monitoring Initiative annex of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Finally, our results support incorporation of foodweb metrics into resource management, and selection of informative variables over those that lack sufficient contrast for tracking progress in achieving policy goals.","parentId":"56bcd88ae4b08d617f66b28e","linkParentIds":["4f4e4773e4b07f02db47e244","50538b4ae4b097cd4fce2f5f","57ffa6bae4b0824b2d16f494"],"contacts":[{"name":"Richard T Kraus","oldPartyId":23118,"type":"Contact","contactType":"person","email":"rkraus@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Fisheries Biologist","firstName":"Richard","middleName":"T","lastName":"Kraus","organization":{"displayText":"Lake Erie Biology Station, GLSC"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"4193662117","officePhone":"4196251976","streetAddress":{"zip":"44870","city":"Sandusky","state":"OH","line1":"6100 Columbus Avenue"},"buildingCode":"AOC","name":"Richard T Kraus\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"44870","country":"USA","city":"Sandusky","state":"OH","line1":"6100 Columbus Avenue"},"building":"Lake Erie Biological Station"}},{"name":"Richard T Kraus","oldPartyId":23118,"type":"Metadata Contact","contactType":"person","email":"rkraus@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Fisheries Biologist","firstName":"Richard","middleName":"T","lastName":"Kraus","organization":{"displayText":"Lake Erie Biology Station, GLSC"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"4193662117","officePhone":"4196251976","streetAddress":{"zip":"44870","city":"Sandusky","state":"OH","line1":"6100 Columbus Avenue"},"buildingCode":"AOC","name":"Richard T Kraus\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"44870","country":"USA","city":"Sandusky","state":"OH","line1":"6100 Columbus Avenue"},"building":"Lake Erie Biological Station"}},{"name":"Betsy L Bodamer Scarbro","oldPartyId":60797,"type":"Originator","contactType":"person","email":"bbodamerscarbro@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Contrator","firstName":"Betsy","middleName":"L","lastName":"Bodamer Scarbro","organization":{"displayText":"Lake Erie Biology Station, GLSC"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"4196257164","officePhone":"4196251976","streetAddress":{"zip":"44870","city":"Sandusky","state":"OH","line1":"6100 Columbus Avenue"},"buildingCode":"AOC","name":"Betsy L Bodamer Scarbro\/BRD\/CONT\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"44870","country":"USA","city":"Sandusky","state":"OH","line1":"6100 Columbus Avenue"},"building":"Lake Erie Biological Station"}},{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey","oldPartyId":18139,"type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","onlineResource":"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/","active":true,"aliases":["Geological Survey (U.S.)","USGS","U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY"],"fbmsCodes":["GG00000000"],"logoUrl":"http:\/\/my.usgs.gov\/static-cache\/images\/dataOwner\/v1\/logosMed\/USGSLogo.gif","smallLogoUrl":"http:\/\/my.usgs.gov\/static-cache\/images\/dataOwner\/v1\/logosSmall\/USGSLogo.gif","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"U.S. Geological Survey - Location","mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey - ScienceBase","oldPartyId":70157,"type":"Distributor","contactType":"organization","onlineResource":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov","email":"sciencebase@usgs.gov","primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"18882758747","streetAddress":[],"name":"U.S. Geological Survey - ScienceBase - Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80225","country":"United States","mailStopCode":"302","city":"Denver","state":"CO","line2":"Building 810","line1":"Denver Federal Center"}}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"publicationReferenceSource","typeLabel":"Publication that references this resource","uri":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1139\/cjfas-2014-0517","title":" Kraus, R.

change for the Great Lakes","body":"<p>This project addressed regional climate change effects on aquatic food webs in the Great Lakes. We sought insights by examining Lake Erie as a representative system with a high level of anthropogenic impacts, strong nutrient gradients, seasonal hypoxia, and spatial overlap of cold- and cool-water fish guilds. In Lake Erie and in large embayments throughout the Great Lakes basin, this situation is a concern for fishery managers, as climate change may exacerbate hypoxia and reduce habitat volume for some species. We examined fish community composition, fine-scale distribution, prey availability, diets, and biochemical tracers for dominant fishes from study areas with medium-high nutrient levels (mesotrophic, Fairport study area), and low nutrient levels (oligotrophic, Erie study area). This multi-year database (2011-2013) provides the ability to contrast years with wide variation in rainfall, winter ice-cover, and thermal stratification. In addition, multiple indicators of dietary and distributional responses to environmental variability will allow resource managers to select the most informative approach for addressing specific climate change questions. Our results support the incorporation of some relatively simple and cost-efficient approaches into existing agency monitoring programs to track the near-term condition status of fish and fish community composition by functional groupings. Other metrics appear better suited for understanding longer-term changes, and may take more resources to implement on an ongoing basis. Although we hypothesized that dietary overlap and similarity in selected species would be sharply different during thermal stratification and hypoxic episodes, we found little evidence of this. Instead, to our surprise, this study found that fish tended to aggregate at the edges of hypoxia, highlighting potential spatial changes in catch efficiency of the fishery. This work has had several positive impacts on a wide range of resource management and stakeholder activities, most notably in Lake Erie. The results were instrumental in the development of an interim decision rule for dealing with data collected during hypoxic events to improve stock assessment of Yellow Perch. In addition, novel findings from this study regarding spatial and temporal variability in hypoxia have aided US-Environmental Protection Agency in the development of a modified sampling protocol to more accurately quantify the central basin hypoxic zone, and this directly addressed a goal of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 2012 to reduce the extent and severity of hypoxia. Finally, the study areas developed in this project formed the basis for food web sampling in the 2014 bi-national Coordinated Science and Monitoring Initiative work in Lake Erie.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["50538b53e4b097cd4fce2f63"],"contacts":[{"name":"Richard T.

Yet, fishery landings from these systems are frequently unresponsive to changes in the severity and extent of hypoxia, and population-scale effects have been difficult to measure except in extreme hypoxic conditions with hypoxia-sensitive species. We investigated fine-scale temporal and spatial variability in dissolved oxygen in Lake Erie as it related to fish distribution and catch efficiencies of both active (bottom trawls) and passive (trap nets) fishing gears. Temperature and dissolved oxygen loggers placed near the edge of the hypolimnion exhibited much higher than expected variability. Hypoxic episodes of variable durations were frequently punctuated by periods of normoxia, consistent with high-frequency internal waves. High-resolution interpolations of water quality and hydroacoustic surveys suggest that fish habitat is compressed during hypoxic episodes, resulting in higher fish densities near the edges of hypoxia. At fixed locations with passive commercial fishing gear, catches with the highest values occurred when bottom waters were hypoxic for intermediate proportions of time. Proximity to hypoxia explained significant variation in bottom trawl catches, with higher catch rates near the edge of hypoxia. These results emphasize how hypoxia may elevate catch rates in various types of fishing gears, leading to a lack of association between indices of hypoxia and fishery landings. Increased catch rates of fish at the edges of hypoxia have important implications for stock assessment models that assume catchability is spatially homogeneous.","parentId":"50538b53e4b097cd4fce2f63","contacts":[{"name":"Richard T.

One portion of the search dealt with an online literature search for published peer-reviewed articles for the period of approximately 2000 to present. The second portion of the search dealt with contacting US Geological Survey (USGS) Water Science Centers and state institutions to request information on current research projects dealing with this topic that have not yet been published or are currently in publication. Geographic location was considered during the search, and only projects and publications taking place within one of the LCC\u2019s were acquired. The two LCC\u2019s cover partial states in some cases, but searches were conducted for the state as a whole if any portion of the state fell within one of the two LCC's. In addition, relevant publications were obtained for southern Ontario, Canada. An outline for search methodology, including sources and keywords, was used to keep the search process consistent and well-documented. In addition, manual filtering of results was required to ensure that they were both contextually and geographically relevant. &nbsp;While the effort is likely not entirely exhaustive, the methodology entailed a progression of searches using multiple search engines and resources that upon completion did not return any results that had not already been acquired. The software tool EndNote was selected for compiling the database as this tool assisted in streamlining the process of publication retrieval during the literature search. It also standardized the way in which publications were recorded and provided a means to organize, reduce redundancy, and search the database. The resulting products for each LCC were aggregated to produce one final EndNote library. The library was categorized by geographic location but can be categorized using various criteria and keyword searches within EndNote. Through cooperation with the Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA), a searchable format geared toward the general end-user can be generated.\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n<\/div>","parentId":"5006f879e4b0abf7ce733fb8","contacts":[{"name":"Kasey J Hutchinson","oldPartyId":4869,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"khutchin@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Hydrologic Technician","firstName":"Kasey","middleName":"J","lastName":"Hutchinson","organization":{"displayText":"Iowa Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":{"zip":"52240-4105","country":"US","city":"Iowa City","state":"IA","line1":"400 South Clinton Street"},"buildingCode":"KJC","name":"Kasey J Hutchinson\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"52244","country":"USA","city":"Iowa City","state":"IA","line1":"P.O.

extensive search for compelted and ongoing research that deals with climate change and agriculture in the context of water quality, for the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie and Big Rivers Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) and the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes LCC.&nbsp;The search to acquire this information was two-fold. One portion of the search dealt with an online literature search for published peer-reviewed articles for the period of approximately 2000 to present. The second portion of the search dealt with contacting US Geological Survey (USGS) Water Science Centers and state institutions to request information on current research projects dealing with this topic that have not yet been published or are currently in publication. Geographic location was considered during the search, and only projects and publications taking place within one of the LCC\u2019s were acquired. The two LCC\u2019s cover partial states in some cases, but searches were conducted for the state as a whole if any portion of the state fell within one of the two LCC's. In addition, relevant publications were obtained for southern Ontario, Canada. An outline for search methodology, including sources and keywords, was used to keep the search process consistent and well-documented. In addition, manual filtering of results was required to ensure that they were both contextually and geographically relevant. &nbsp;While the effort is likely not entirely exhaustive, the methodology entailed a progression of searches using multiple search engines and resources that upon completion did not return any results that had not already been acquired. The software tool EndNote was selected for compiling the database as this tool assisted in streamlining the process of publication retrieval during the literature search. It also standardized the way in which publications were recorded and provided a means to organize, reduce redundancy, and search the database. The resulting products for each LCC were aggregated to produce one final EndNote library. The library was categorized by geographic location but can be categorized using various criteria and keyword searches within EndNote. Through cooperation with the Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA), a searchable format geared toward the general end-user can be generated. \n<div>\n &nbsp;\n<\/div>","parentId":"51db0dd8e4b010c7f6a814b0","contacts":[{"name":"Kasey J Hutchinson","oldPartyId":4869,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"khutchin@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Hydrologic Technician","firstName":"Kasey","middleName":"J","lastName":"Hutchinson","organization":{"displayText":"Iowa Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":{"zip":"52240-4105","country":"US","city":"Iowa City","state":"IA","line1":"400 South Clinton Street"},"buildingCode":"KJC","name":"Kasey J Hutchinson\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"52244","country":"USA","city":"Iowa City","state":"IA","line1":"P.O.

However, resources are classified and mapped differently on each side&nbsp;of the border, which creates challenges for habitat evaluation, species modeling, and predicting the effects of climate change. To remedy this, ecologists from The Nature Conservancy collaborated with a committee of scientists from various Canadian institutions to produce the first international map of terrestrial habitats for northeastern North America. The project used extensive spatial data on geology, soils, landforms, wetlands, elevation and climate.&nbsp;Additionally, all four provinces contributed spatially comprehensive forest inventory data consisting of 3 million polygons depicting the tree composition of individual forest stands. The Atlantic Conservation Data Centre contributed precise spatial locations of over 200,000 species. The resulting map shows the distribution of 40 upland and wetland habitats, 29 of which are shared by both countries. It has been integrated with the Northeast Terrestrial Habitat Map, which covers 13 northeast states and the District of Columbia in the U.S. This project was funded by the Department of the Interior Northeast Climate Science Center and the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative.<\/p>","materialRequestInstructions":"<p>The methods we will use to create this map were developed and refined during the three-year period in which we produced the Northeast Terrestrial Habitat Map. They make extensive use of field-collected data combined with national and provincial datasets. Early in the project much time will be committed to the compilation and development of spatial datasets of important environmental variables, and in compiling numerous plot-based samples of various ecological systems. The modeling process combines the plot-based samples, tagged to the correct ecological system, with the region-wide GIS data layers. Regression trees are used to identify the variables that best delineate the ecological systems, and then to model those systems. This final map is a composite of the individual models. Structural attributes like canopy density and datasets related to vegetation height and biomass may have a role in detailing forest successional stage.<\/p>","parentId":"5006f879e4b0abf7ce733fb8","contacts":[{"name":"Kevin

grid that maps upland and wetland wildlife habitats\/ecological systems for the Northeastern US, including all 13 states from Maine to Virginia, west to New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and for the Maritime provinces of Canada (Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick) and southeastern Quebec. Mapped habitat types are drawn from the Northeastern Terrestrial Habitat Classification System (NETHCS) and from some ecological system types identifed by Canadian ecologists as being unique to Canada. The NETHCS is based on NatureServe\u2019s Ecological Systems Classification, augmented with additional information from individual state wildlife classifications and other information specific to wildlife managers. A terrestrial ecological system is defined as a mosaic of plant community types that tend to co-occur within landscapes with similar ecological processes, substrates, and\/or environmental gradients, in a pattern that repeats itself across landscapes. Systems occur at various scales, from \"matrix\" forested systems of thousands of hectares to small patch systems, such as cliffs, basin wetlands, or barrens on a particular bedrock type, of one or two hectares.","purpose":"The purpose of this mapping effort is to provide a common framework and language for conservation planning and wildlife management across jurisdictional borders. Specifically, the NE Terrestrial Habitat Classification System and this map are meant to: provide a standardized and consistent habitat and ecosystem classification at multiple scales across states, provinces, and international borders; facilitate interjurisdictional communication about habitats; offer managers a tool for understanding regional biodiversity patterns; allow for more effective and efficient habitat conservation across the region, including the priortization of habitat conservation activities. The Canada-Northeast Terrestrial Habitat Map was supported by: State Wildlife Grant funding awarded through the Northeast Regional Conservation Needs (RCN) Program, which joins thirteen northeast states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in a partnership to address landscape-scale, regional wildlife conservation issues; the US Fish & Wildlife Service's North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NALCC); and the US Department of the Interior Northeast Climate Science Center (NECSC).","parentId":"505b361de4b08c986b30c073","contacts":[{"name":"The

Map to Atlantic Canada","body":"The Northeast United States and Atlantic Canada share many of the same types of forests, wetlands, and natural communities, and from a wildlife perspective the region is one contiguous forest. However, resources are classified and mapped differently on each side&nbsp;of the border, which creates challenges for habitat evaluation, species modeling, and predicting the effects of climate change. To remedy this, ecologists from The Nature Conservancy collaborated with a committee of scientists from various Canadian institutions to produce the first international map of terrestrial habitats for northeastern North America. The project used extensive spatial data on geology, soils, landforms, wetlands, elevation and climate.&nbsp;Additionally, all four provinces contributed spatially comprehensive forest inventory data consisting of 3 million polygons depicting the tree composition of individual forest stands. The Atlantic Conservation Data Centre contributed precise spatial locations of over 200,000 species. The resulting map shows the distribution of 40 upland and wetland habitats, 29 of which are shared by both countries. It has been integrated with the Northeast Terrestrial Habitat Map, which covers 13 northeast states and the District of Columbia in the U.S. This project was funded by the Department of the Interior Northeast Climate Science Center and the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative.","purpose":"The objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive terrestrial habitat map for the Atlantic Canada section of the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative region by extending the Northeast Terrestrial Habitat Map (Ferree and Anderson 2011) to Maritime Canada and southern Quebec. The final map consists of a spatially comprehensive GIS grid of 30 meter pixels with a legend portraying the habitats of Canada using a standard classification that matches the US classification. The map can be used as a basis for climate change research, conservation inventory, species modeling, ecosystem service estimates, and other cross border research related to the extent and distribution of natural habitats.

However, resources are classified and mapped differently on the two sides of the border, creating challenges for habitat evaluation, species modeling, and predicting the effects of climate change. To remedy this, ecologists from The Nature Conservancy collaborated with a committee of scientists from various Canadian institutions to produce the first international map of terrestrial habitats for northeast North America. The project used extensive spatial data on geology, soils, landforms, wetlands, elevation and climate. &nbsp;Additionally, all four provinces contributed spatially comprehensive forest inventory data consisting of 3 million polygons depicting the tree composition of individual forest stands. The Atlantic Conservation Data Centre contributed precise spatial locations of over 200,000 species. The resulting map shows the distribution of 40 upland and wetland habitats, 29 of which are shared by both countries. It has been integrated with the Northeast Terrestrial Habitat Map that covers 13 northeast states and the District of Columbia in the U.S. This project was funded by the Department of the Interior Northeast Climate Science Center and the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative.","parentId":"505b362ae4b08c986b30c079","contacts":[{"name":"Mark G.

To better anticipate these changes, there is a need to compile both short- and long-term stream temperature data for managers to gain an understanding of baseline conditions, historic trends, and future projections. Unfortunately, many agencies lack sufficient resources to compile, conduct quality assurance and control, and make accessible stream temperature data collected through routine monitoring. Yet, pooled data from many sources, even if temporally and spatially inconsistent, can have great value both in the realm of stream temperature and aquatic response. The NorEaST web portal was developed to serve as a coordinated, multi-agency regional framework to map and store continuous stream temperature locations and data for New England, Mid Atlantic, and Great Lakes states. NorEaST consists of a mapper where the public can view locations and metadata for current and historic stream temperature monitoring sites, a database where data stewards can store and manage their data, and web services to connect, communicate, and serve data for use in analysis and applications. Currently, stream temperature monitoring locations and metadata can be viewed for more than 10,000 monitoring locations across 30 states, contributed by 40 different organizations. Organizations collecting continuous stream temperature data can request to become NorEaST users and data stewards can use the web portal to store and manage their organization\u2019s continuous stream temperature data. To demonstrate the utility of large scale, consistent stream temperature data for use in regional analyses and decision-making, stream temperature data collected as part of the NorEaST project were used in three different targeted applications. These applications included generating stream thermal metrics, analyzing fish species response to stream thermal metrics, and evaluating stream temperature modeling approaches for use by aquatic resource managers. &nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"5006f879e4b0abf7ce733fb8","contacts":[{"name":"Jana S Stewart","oldPartyId":9939,"type":"Principal

ecosystems. To better anticipate these changes, there is a need to compile both short- and long-term stream temperature data for managers to gain an understanding of baseline conditions, historic trends, and future projections. Unfortunately, many agencies lack sufficient resources to compile, conduct quality assurance and control, and make accessible stream temperature data collected through routine monitoring.&nbsp; Yet, pooled data from multiple sources, even if temporally and spatially inconsistent, can have great value both in the realm of stream temperature and aquatic response. The \n<a href=\"http:\/\/wim.usgs.gov\/NorEaST\/\">NorEaST web portal<\/a> was developed to meet this need, serving as a coordinated, multi-agency regional framework to map and store continuous stream temperature locations and data for New England, Mid Atlantic, and Great Lakes states.&nbsp;","parentId":"50538a46e4b097cd4fce2b45","contacts":[{"name":"Jana S Stewart","oldPartyId":9939,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jsstewar@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Geographer","firstName":"Jana","middleName":"S","lastName":"Stewart","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Wisconsin Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"6088213817","officePhone":"6088213855","streetAddress":{"zip":"53562","city":"Middleton","state":"WI","line1":"8505 Research Way"},"buildingCode":"ARM","name":"Jana S Stewart\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"53562-3581","country":"USA","city":"Middleton","state":"WI","line1":"8505 Research Way"},"building":"8505 Research Way"}},{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/wim.usgs.gov\/NorEaST\/","title":"Online NorEaST Tool","hidden":false}],"tags":[{"name":"Streams"},{"name":"Database"},{"name":"Portal"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-09-17T11:37:06.295-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-02-23T14:17:44.578-07:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2015","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-09-17T11:37:06.295-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-02-23T14:17:44.578-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c648de4b0546c0c397b43","people":["Jana S Stewart"],"orgs":["Northeast CSC"],"children":[]},"580151dae4b0824b2d18be18":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5012ea4be4b05140039e03de","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"StreamThermal: A Software Package for Calculating Thermal Metrics from Stream Temperature Data","relatedTitle":"NorEaST: A Stream Temperature Inventory Network and Decision Support Metadata Mapper","id":"580151dae4b0824b2d18be18","relatedId":"5012ea4be4b05140039e03de","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/580151dae4b0824b2d18be18","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"NorEaST: A Stream Temperature Inventory Network and Decision Support Metadata Mapper","relatedTitle":"StreamThermal: A Software Package for Calculating Thermal Metrics from Stream Temperature Data","id":"5012ea4be4b05140039e03de","relatedId":"580151dae4b0824b2d18be18","annotation":null}]},"id":"580151dae4b0824b2d18be18","title":"StreamThermal: A Software Package for Calculating Thermal Metrics from Stream Temperature Data","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/03632415.2016.1210517):&nbsp;Improving quality and better availability of continuous stream temperature data allow natural resource managers, particularly in fisheries, to understand associations between different characteristics of stream thermal regimes and stream fishes. However, there is no convenient tool to efficiently characterize multiple metrics reflecting stream thermal regimes with the increasing amount of data from continuously recording data loggers. This article describes a software program packaged as a library in R to facilitate this process. With this freely available package, users will be able to quickly summarize metrics that describe five categories of stream thermal regimes: magnitude, variability, frequency, timing, and rate of change. The installation and usage instruction of this package, the definition of calculated thermal metrics, as well as the output format from the package are described, along with an application showing the utility for multiple metrics. We believe that this package can be widely utilized by interested stakeholders and can greatly assist future fisheries studies.","parentId":"50538a46e4b097cd4fce2b45","contacts":[{"name":"Yin-Phan Tsang","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Michigan State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Dana M.

Changes in climate are expected to lead to additional changes in stream habitats and fish assemblages in multiple ways, including changing stream water temperatures. To manage streams from current impacts and future changes, managers need region-wide information for decision-making and developing proactive management strategies. This project meets that need by integrating results of a current condition assessment of stream habitats based on fish response to human land use, water quality impairment, and fragmentation by dams with estimates of which stream habitats may change in the future. Results will be available for all streams in the NE CSC region through a spatially-explicit, web-based viewer, the Climate Change Visualization and Integration of Ecological and Watershed Resources (CCVIEWeR). With this tool, managers can evaluate how streams of interest are currently impacted by land uses and assess if those habitats may change with climate. These results, available in a comparable way throughout the NE CSC, provide natural resource managers, decision-makers, and the public a wealth of information to better protect and conserve stream fishes and their habitats.&nbsp; <\/div>","parentId":"52604642e4b04eaeeb44eda8","linkParentIds":["55dde161e4b0518e354dfc8c"],"contacts":[{"name":"Joanna

Grassland Bird Populations to Climate Change","body":"<div>Prairie ecosystems and the grassland birds that rely on them for habitat may be particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in climate. Extensive portions of prairie have already been lost due to agriculture and urbanization, and as a result grassland birds have declined more than any other bird group in the last four decades. Now, climate change could exacerbate existing threats to these birds as temperatures in certain prairie ecosystems are expected to rise and extreme weather events, such as drought, could become more common.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThe goal of this project is to better understand the current and future impacts of climate change on grassland bird species, such as the Henslow\u2019s Sparrow and the Bobolink. To do this, researchers will examine how different bird populations respond to climate change \u2013through changes in survival and reproduction \u2013 as well as identify the degree to which populations will be exposed to future changes in climate, based on climate model predictions. This information will then be used to forecast how bird populations might change demographically and how their distributions might shift as a result. Finally, researchers will help managers evaluate the efficacy of current grassland bird management practices and determine whether these strategies need to be altered to successfully conserve grassland bird species, given the projected population responses to unprecedented changes in climate.<br>\n&nbsp;<\/div>\n","purpose":"Prairie ecosystems and many grassland birds are particularly vulnerable to rapid shifts in climate variability and associated changes in drought and extreme weather events. For grassland birds, climate change is likely to exacerbate environmental threats such as habitat loss due to shifting agricultural practices and housing sprawl. The project goal is to develop a decision support framework for identifying which demographic characteristics make certain grassland bird species particularly sensitive to climate variability and which regions have the highest level of exposure to future climate change. Project objectives are to 1) convene a core group of scientists and managers involved in grassland bird conservation to build a demographic database for a select group of grassland birds, 2) use downscaled climate projections and land-use change models to develop demographically informed species distribution models in order to estimate species-specific sensitivities and exposures to future climate change, and 3) build management scenarios directly into the modeling approach to assist managers in evaluating the efficacy of current grassland bird management and conservation planning in the future. Using this approach, project researchers will produce spatially-explicit projections of population dynamics to identify regions that might become more or less suitable for grassland birds in the future. Ultimately, the researchers will provide a vulnerability assessment framework for evaluating the management of grassland bird populations at multiple spatiotemporal scales.

Succession, harvest, and climate are potentially important factors affecting forest composition and structure in the region. The goal of this project was to predict the distribution and abundance of dominant tree species across portions of the Eastern U.S. under alternative climate scenarios from present to the end of the century. We used the forest landscape change LANDIS PRO and hybrid empirical-physiological ecosystem model LINKAGES to model changes in forest biomass and species abundances and distribution in the North Atlantic region of the U.S. while accounting for climate change, succession, and harvest. Three climate scenarios were considered, defined by a general circulation model and emission scenario: PCM B1, CGCM A2, and GFDL A1FI. We then compared results from three alternative modeling approaches; LANDIS PRO, LINKAGES, and TreeAtlas for the Central Hardwood, Central Appalachian, Mid-Atlantic, and New England regions to determine agreement among models and establish a stronger inference for projected changes through model averaging. Tree Atlas is a statistically derived enhanced niche model in contrast to the process driven ecosystem and landscape models LINKAGES and LANDIS PRO. Researchers on this project actively worked with the Gulf Coast Plains and Ozarks LCC and the Northern Institute of Applied Climate Change (NIACS). NIACS is a partnership between the U.S. Forest Service, state agencies, and NGOs with a focus on climate change adaptation.&nbsp; This project provides assessments of landscape change and vulnerability of tree species to climate change, and will be used to guide climate adaptation planning and management across the region.

Northeastern U.S. Under Alternative Climate Scenarios","body":"Forests in the Eastern United States are in the early- and mid-successional stages recovering from historical land use. Succession, harvest, and climate are potentially important factors affecting forest composition and structure in the region. The goal of this project was to predict the distribution and abundance of dominant tree species across portions of the Eastern U.S. under alternative climate scenarios from present to the end of the century. We used the forest landscape change LANDIS PRO and hybrid empirical-physiological ecosystem model LINKAGES to model changes in forest biomass and species abundances and distribution in the North Atlantic region of the U.S. while accounting for climate change, succession, and harvest. Three climate scenarios were considered, defined by a general circulation model and emission scenario: PCM B1, CGCM A2, and GFDL A1FI. We then compared results from three alternative modeling approaches; LANDIS PRO, LINKAGES, and TreeAtlas for the Central Hardwood, Central Appalachian, Mid-Atlantic, and New England regions to determine agreement among models and establish a stronger inference for projected changes through model averaging. Tree Atlas is a statistically derived enhanced niche model in contrast to the process driven ecosystem and landscape models LINKAGES and LANDIS PRO. Researchers on this project actively worked with the Gulf Coast Plains and Ozarks LCC and the Northern Institute of Applied Climate Change (NIACS). NIACS is a partnership between the U.S. Forest Service, state agencies, and NGOs with a focus on climate change adaptation.","purpose":"This project provides assessments of landscape change and vulnerability of tree species to climate change, and will be used to guide climate adaptation planning and management across the region.","parentId":"5213be90e4b0b08f44619ffe","contacts":[{"name":"USDA US Forest Service, Northern Research Station","type":"Point of Contact","contactType":"organization","organizationsPerson":"Frank R.

We examined USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data to identify tree species that have expanded longitudinally in range, particularly into the central United States. We analyzed compositional differences within ecological regions (i.e., subsections) in eastern and western ranges of species using repeated measures ANOVA. We considered differences in outer ranges to indicate range expansion or contraction. We also estimated the shift in forest area and basal area relative to the center of the US and compared change in deciduous forest land cover. Out of 80 candidate species, 22 species expanded to the west, seven species expanded to the east, and five species expanded in both directions. During the survey interval, eastern tree species advanced into the predominantly non-forested ecosystems of central United States. Eastern cottonwood, eastern hophornbeam, eastern redbud, honeylocust, Osage\u2013orange, pecan, red mulberry, and Shumard oak represent some of the species that are advancing eastern forest boundaries across forest-grassland ecotones into the central United States. Forest land has shifted towards the center of the continent, as has the center of mean tree basal area, and a simple comparison of deciduous cover change also displayed forest advancement into the central United States from eastern forests. The expanding species may spread along riparian migration corridors that provide protection from drought. Humans use the advancing tree species for windbreaks, fencerows, and ornamental landscaping, while wildlife spread fruit seeds, which results in unintentional assisted migration, or translocation, to drier sites across the region.","parentId":"5213be89e4b0b08f44619ffc","contacts":[{"name":"Brice B.

We predicted the distribution and abundance of common tree species across portions of the Eastern U.S. under alternative climate scenarios that varied in the amount of warming by the end of the century from 1.1 to 4.2 degrees C. We used a forest landscape change model to forecast changes in tree abundances and distribution in the North Atlantic region of the U.S. while accounting for climate change, succession, and harvest. We then considered a broader region of the U.S. and combined our results with results from previous studies to compare forecasts from three different modeling approaches for the Central Hardwood, Central Appalachian, Mid-Atlantic, and New England regions of the U.S. to determine the level of agreement among models. Our forecasts for the North Atlantic region indicated tree abundances were affected first by succession and harvest but second by climate. We predicted an Increase in Southern and Central Hardwood species and a decrease in Northern Hardwood and sprucefir forest species under warming climates over the next 300 years. Our comparison of the three modeling approaches across the Eastern U.S. indicated high agreement for many species, especially northern species modeled to lose habitat in coming decades. There was agreement among models for decreases in black spruce, balsam fir, northern white cedar, and red spruce, and increases in loblolly pine and some oaks and hickories. Agreement across different modeling approaches and different climate scenarios provides strong evidence of potentially important changes to forests in response to climate change. These results can be used to guide decisions about how to manage forests under climate change to continue to provide the benefits we derive from them.","parentId":"5213be89e4b0b08f44619ffc","contacts":[{"name":"Frank  Thompson","oldPartyId":64840,"contactType":"person","email":"frthompson@fs.fed.us","active":true,"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Thompson","organization":{"displayText":"USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Forests"},{"name":"New England"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2015-12-28","label":"Date Reported"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-04-13T10:28:45.225-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-04-13T10:31:01.932-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"other":[{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2015-12-28","label":"Date Reported"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-04-13T10:28:45.225-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-04-13T10:31:01.932-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Final Report","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"useForPreview":false,"size":1749765,"dateUploaded":"2016-04-13T16:30:43.000Z","name":"ThompsonFinalReport_ChangesForestLandscapes.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__b8\/79\/fe\/b879fe29f74b4e0db4d85bb10391b4fbbe81179d","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/570e73bde4b0ef3b7ca24d23?f=__disk__b8%2F79%2Ffe%2Fb879fe29f74b4e0db4d85bb10391b4fbbe81179d"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/570e73bde4b0ef3b7ca24d23","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalProjectRep.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c648de4b0546c0c397b43","people":["Frank  Thompson"],"orgs":["Northeast CSC"],"children":[]},"56a90b75e4b0b28f1184dd28":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/52138d12e4b0b08f44619bf5","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Importance of succession, harvest, and climate change in determining future composition in U.S. Central Hardwood Forests","relatedTitle":"Changes in Forested Landscapes of the Northeastern U.S. Under Alternative Climate Scenarios","id":"56a90b75e4b0b28f1184dd28","relatedId":"52138d12e4b0b08f44619bf5","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/56a90b75e4b0b28f1184dd28","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Changes in Forested Landscapes of the Northeastern U.S. Under Alternative Climate Scenarios","relatedTitle":"Importance of succession, harvest, and climate change in determining future composition in U.S. Central Hardwood Forests","id":"52138d12e4b0b08f44619bf5","relatedId":"56a90b75e4b0b28f1184dd28","annotation":null}]},"id":"56a90b75e4b0b28f1184dd28","title":"Importance of succession, harvest, and climate change in determining future composition in U.S. Central Hardwood Forests","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1890\/ES15-00238.1\/abstract):&nbsp;Most temperate forests in U.S. are recovering from heavy exploitation and are in intermediate successional stages where partial tree harvest is the primary disturbance. Changes in regional forest composition in response to climate change are often predicted for plant functional types using biophysical process models. These models usually simplify the simulation of succession and harvest and may not consider important species-specific demographic processes driving forests changes. We determined the relative importance of succession, harvest, and climate change to forest composition changes in a 125-million ha area of the Central Hardwood Forest Region of U.S. We used a forest landscape modeling approach to project changes in density and basal area of 23 tree species due to succession, harvest, and four climate scenarios from 2000 to 2300. On average, succession, harvest, and climate change explained 78, 17, and 1% of the variation in species importance values (IV) at 2050, respectively, but their contribution changed to 46, 26, and 20% by 2300. Climate change led to substantial increases in the importance of red maple and southern species (e.g., yellow-poplar) and decreases in northern species (e.g., sugar maple) and most of widely distributed species (e.g., white oak). Harvest interacted with climate change and accelerated changes in some species (e.g., increasing southern red oak and decreasing American beech) while ameliorated the changes for others (e.g., increasing red maple and decreasing white ash). Succession was the primary driver of forest composition change over the next 300 years. The effects of harvest on composition were more important than climate change in the short term but climate change became more important than harvest in the long term. Our results show that it is important to model species-specific responses when predicting changes in forest composition and structure in response to succession, harvest, and climate change.","parentId":"5213be89e4b0b08f44619ffc","contacts":[{"name":"Wen J.

Given that flooding may increase with climate change and reforestation will increase resiliency to climate change, we tested whether reforested floodplains also have great potential to store carbon and the effects of even modest increases in forested acreage on carbon storage. To calculate potential aboveground biomass in the Lower Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (LMAV) of the United States, we determined current and historical tree biomass used density estimates and diameter distributions from tree surveys and relationships between diameter and biomass from current forests. To calculate potential soil organic carbon if the landscape was forested, we used soil organic matter from soil surveys of the agricultural landscape, and multiplied the carbon by a factors of 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75 based on published reports of soil carbon increases due to afforestation. Our results showed that area-weighted mean biomass density (trees \u226512.7&nbsp;cm in diameter) for historical forests was 300&nbsp;Mg\/ha, ranging from 228&nbsp;Mg\/ha to 332&nbsp;Mg\/ha by ecological subsection, based on the most conservative diameter distribution. Mean biomass density for current forests was 97&nbsp;Mg\/ha, ranging from 92&nbsp;Mg\/ha to 111&nbsp;Mg\/ha. Mean carbon density for agricultural soils was 96&nbsp;Mg\/ha, whereas combined tree and soil carbon densities varied from 169&nbsp;Mg\/ha to 317&nbsp;Mg\/ha; soil carbon accounted for 0.5\u20130.7 of total carbon density. Historical forested carbon storage in the Missouri LMAV was about 234&nbsp;TgC, with the most conservative diameter distribution and assuming 80% forest coverage. Current forested carbon storage in the Missouri LMAV is about 2% of historical storage, at 5&nbsp;TgC in 30,000&nbsp;ha of forests, but may reach 23&nbsp;TgC if forested extent almost triples, with the addition of 50,000&nbsp;ha of marginal agricultural land, and carbon storage increases in trees and soil. The entire LMAV currently stores 97&nbsp;TgC in forests and reasonable carbon storage for the entire LMAV may be about 335&nbsp;TgC, based on increased carbon storage and reforestation of 600,000&nbsp;ha of marginal agricultural land, which would double the current forested extent. Although 335&nbsp;TgC storage for the LMAV is only about 1.5 times greater than historical carbon storage of the Missouri LMAV, doubling the forested extent will increase other ecosystem functions, including carbon storage, flood abatement, and reduction of fertilizer pollution in the Gulf of Mexico.","parentId":"5213be89e4b0b08f44619ffc","contacts":[{"name":"Brice B.

This project seeks to provide an example of cooperative landscape decision-making by addressing the conservation of headwater stream ecosystems in the face of climate change at the watershed scale. Predictive models will be built for critical resources to examine the effects of the potential alternative actions on the objectives, taking account of climate effects and examining whether there are key uncertainties that impede decision making. &nbsp;Results will provide decision analyses that are (1) relevant to the management partners in question; (2) emblematic of landscape-scale cooperative decisions; and (3) sensitive to the practical consequences of climate change.<br>\n<br>\nThe successful application of structured decision making (SDM) requires the involvement of resource managers at each step in the decision. By involving federal, state, local and non-profit management organizations, the PIs will ensure that the decision outcomes are suitable for all involved. Though they may identify a decision which is not optimal for each management organization, species group, or protected area of a given watershed individually, collectively results will be able to satisfy the regional objectives for headwater stream systems.

Decisions in Complex Landscapes:  Headwater Stream Management Across Multiple Federal Agencies","body":"Headwater stream ecosystems are vulnerable to numerous threats associated with climate and land use change. In the northeastern US, many headwater stream species (e.g., brook trout and stream salamanders) are of special conservation concern and may be vulnerable to climate change influences, such as changes in stream temperature and streamflow. Federal land management agencies (e.g., US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, USDA Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management and Department of Defense) are required to adopt policies that respond to climate change and may have longer-term institutional support to enforce such policies compared to state, local, non-governmental, or private land managers. However, federal agencies largely make management decisions in regards to headwater stream ecosystems independently. This fragmentation of management resources and responsibilities across the landscape may significantly impede the efficiency and effectiveness of conservation actions, and higher degrees of collaboration may be required to achieve conservation goals. This project seeks to provide an example of cooperative landscape decision-making to address the conservation of headwater stream ecosystems.","parentId":"5213cb41e4b0b08f4461a3fe","contacts":[{"name":"Rachel Katz","oldPartyId":66162,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"rakatz@umass.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Rachel","lastName":"Katz","organization":{"displayText":"Massachusetts Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, University of Massachusetts-Amherst"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Evan Grant","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","email":"ehgrant@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Wildlife Biologist","firstName":"Evan","middleName":"H","lastName":"Grant","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"4138639810","officePhone":"4138632462","streetAddress":{"zip":"01376","city":"Turners Falls","state":"MA","line1":"1 Migratory Way"},"buildingCode":"AGB","name":"Evan H Grant\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"01376-0796","country":"USA","city":"Turners Falls","state":"MA","line1":"One Migratory Way, P.O.

Making decisions in complex landscapes: Headwater stream management across multiple agencies using structured decision making","body":"There is growing evidence that headwater stream ecosystems are vulnerable to changing climate and land use, but their conservation is challenged by the need to address the threats at a landscape scale, often through coordination with multiple management agencies and landowners. A decision faced by managers of headwater systems is how to best manage stream habitats to maximize their suitability for multiple species of conservation concern, including stream salamanders and brook trout, which occur in different parts of a stream network, are affected by both the terrestrial landscape and each other, and are likely influenced by future climate change. Because streams and terrestrial habitats are linked, decisions relating to forest management are often linked with stream ecosystem outcomes. Regional management authorities have two important scales of management objectives: long-term objectives that operate at the regional scale and short-term&nbsp; objectives that operate at the local scale and reflected in agency mandates and missions. Identifying obstacles to and opportunities for shared decision making among resource agencies and managers may lead to improvements in the selection of optimal management strategies for landscape-scale resources.This project provides an example of cooperative landscape decision-making to address the conservation of headwater stream ecosystems in the face of climate change using case studies from two watersheds in the northeastern U.S.","parentId":"5213cb58e4b0b08f4461a406","contacts":[{"name":"Rachel Katz","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"https:\/\/necsc.umass.edu\/webinars\/making-decisions-complex-landscapes-headwater-stream-management-across-multiple-agencies-us","title":"Webinar, November 19, 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Headwater Streams"},{"name":"Structured Decision Making"},{"name":"Multiple Decision Makers"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-11-19","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-12-16T10:46:49.105-07:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-25T13:50:44.608-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2014","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-12-16T10:46:49.105-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-25T13:50:44.608-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Website","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c648de4b0546c0c397b43","people":["Rachel Katz"],"orgs":["Northeast CSC"],"children":[]}}}}},"52138ccbe4b0b08f44619bd9":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"52138ccbe4b0b08f44619bd9","title":"Modeling Effects of Climate Change on Spruce-Fir Forest Ecosystems and Associated Priority Bird Populations","body":"<div> Eastern spruce-fir forest ecosystems are among the most vulnerable to climate change within the conterminous US. The goal of this project was to develop tools to identify refugia sites most likely to support spruce-fir forest and its associated high-priority obligate spruce-fir bird species over the long-term under projected climate change scenarios. Specific research objectives included: (1) producing high-resolution (temporal and spatial) projections of spruce-fir forests, including stand characteristics like structure and composition; (2) estimating future changes in the distribution, productivity, and stand characteristics of the spruce-fir forest type due to potential changes in climate; (3) comparing the distribution and condition of spruce-fir forest for different climate change scenarios to identify areas with key physiographic settings likely to support refugia for this forest type; (4) modeling bird occurrence, distribution, nesting phenology, and productivity as functions of climate and these modeled values for forest structure and composition; (5) linking these bird-habitat models to projected climatic and forest conditions to predict future bird occurrence, distribution, nesting phenology, and productivity across the region; and (6) identifying areas with the greatest richness of priority bird species across climate scenarios.<br>\n<br>\nThese objectives were accomplished using long-term vegetation, bird, and remote sensing data from spruce-fir forests across the Northeast and Great Lakes regions to predict the future extent and condition of spruce-fir forests and associated avifauna. In particular, the project combined count datasets for 14 spruce-fir forest bird species as well as 25 long-term vegetation datasets and Landsat satellite imagery to develop a series of species distribution models. Models were used for predicting climate impacts on future habitat suitability for spruce-fir species and for evaluating recent dynamics in the location of the montane spruce-fir ecotone. Finally, maps of contemporary forest conditions were developed by combining field observations and Landsat imagery and will be central to future work focused on modeling the distribution of spruce-fir ecosystems and associated bird species under different climate change and management scenarios. <\/div>","parentId":"52604642e4b04eaeeb44eda8","contacts":[{"name":"Anthony D'Amato","type":"Principal

(from&nbsp;http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006320715001834):&nbsp;Continental-scale monitoring programs with standardized survey protocols play an important role in conservation science by identifying species in decline and prioritizing conservation action. However, rare, inaccessible, or spatially fragmented communities may be underrepresented in continental-scale surveys. Data on these communities often come from decentralized, local monitoring efforts that differ in their goals and survey protocols. We combine 16 point count datasets, controlling for differences in protocol and detection probabilities to estimate regional trends for 14 spruce-fir forest bird species across Northeastern and Midwestern United States, a vulnerable community threatened by numerous anthropogenic stressors and widely considered a priority for conservation. Our analyses indicated that four species considered as ecological indicators for this community, Bicknell\u2019s Thrush ( \n<em>Catharus bicknelli<\/em>), Magnolia Warbler ( \n<em>Setophaga magnolia<\/em>), Blackpoll Warbler ( \n<em>Setophaga striata<\/em>) and Yellow-bellied Flycatcher ( \n<em>Empidonax flaviventris<\/em>), each exhibited significant declines. Olive-sided Flycatcher ( \n<em>Contopus cooperi<\/em>), a species of concern in parts of its range, and two additional species for which no previous concern existed, the Evening Grosbeak ( \n<em>Coccothruastes vespertinus<\/em>) and the Gray Jay ( \n<em>Perisoreus canadensis<\/em>), each also showed significant overall declines. Five out of nine species with sufficient data for analyses from Northeastern and Midwestern surveys showed significant differences in trends between these regions. Spruce-fir obligate species were more likely to decline significantly than species that use spruce-fir in addition to other habitat types. These results demonstrate the value of combining disparate data sources for analyzing regional patterns of population trends to confirm and extend conservation concern for some species and identify others for which additional attention may be needed.","parentId":"5213c934e4b0b08f4461a3cc","contacts":[{"name":"Joel Ralston","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"David I.

To date, few have investigated distributional attributes of individual PFTs and their relationship with key attributes and processes of forest ecosystems. The objective of this study was to quantify the distribution and contribution of various PFTs in determining forest structure, live tree production (volume and biomass), and tree mortality across the eastern US. In total, 16 metrics representing species specific gravity and their shade, flood, and drought tolerance were used to develop a PFT profile for over 23,000 permanent sample plots in the region. Spatial relationships were observed when analyzing not only the mean value of these traits but also measures of PFT complexity: the standard deviation, Shannon\u2019s index (a measure of PFT diversity), and Gini coefficient (a measure of PFT inequality). Results from nonparametric random forests models indicated that variables which formed the PFT profile contributed to explaining broad-scale patterns in the variability in forest structure (volume and biomass of overstory live trees, maximum stand density index, and tree seedling abundance;&nbsp; \n<em>R<\/em>2 &nbsp;ranged from 0.09 to 0.78), production (volume [ \n<em>R<\/em>2 &nbsp;=&nbsp;0.16] and biomass accretion [ \n<em>R<\/em>2 &nbsp;=&nbsp;0.11]), and to a lesser degree, tree mortality. Despite the variability in the data employed and the variety of forest management regimes in these stands, this work demonstrates the utility of applying PFT profiles for understanding and predicting patterns of forest structure and production and their role in critical ecosystem processes such as carbon sequestration.","materialRequestInstructions":"For assistance accessing this publication, please contact the publication author.&nbsp;","parentId":"5213c934e4b0b08f4461a3cc","contacts":[{"name":"Matthew B.

The goal of this project was to develop tools to identify refugia sites most likely to support spruce-fir forest and its associated high-priority obligate spruce-fir bird species over the long-term under projected climate change scenarios. Specific research objectives included: (1) producing high-resolution (temporal and spatial) projections of spruce-fir forests, including stand characteristics like structure and composition; (2) estimating future changes in the distribution, productivity, and stand characteristics of the spruce-fir forest type due to potential changes in climate; (3) comparing the distribution and condition of spruce-fir forest for different climate change scenarios to identify areas with key physiographic settings likely to support refugia for this forest type; (4) modeling bird occurrence, distribution, nesting phenology, and productivity as functions of climate and these modeled values for forest structure and composition; (5) linking these bird-habitat models to projected climatic and forest conditions to predict future bird occurrence, distribution, nesting phenology, and productivity across the region; and (6) identifying areas with the greatest richness of priority bird species across climate scenarios.\n<br> \n<br> These objectives were accomplished using long-term vegetation, bird, and remote sensing data from spruce-fir forests across the Northeast and Great Lakes regions to predict the future extent and condition of spruce-fir forests and associated avifauna. In particular, the project combined count datasets for 14 spruce-fir forest bird species as well as 25 long-term vegetation datasets and Landsat satellite imagery to develop a series of species distribution models. Models were used for predicting climate impacts on future habitat suitability for spruce-fir species and for evaluating recent dynamics in the location of the montane spruce-fir ecotone. Finally, maps of contemporary forest conditions were developed by combining field observations and Landsat imagery and will be central to future work focused on modeling the distribution of spruce-fir ecosystems and associated bird species under different climate change and management scenarios.","parentId":"5213c934e4b0b08f4461a3cc","contacts":[{"name":"Anthony  D'Amato","oldPartyId":64828,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"damato@umn.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"D'Amato","organization":{"displayText":"University of Vermont"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Birds"},{"name":"Forest"},{"name":"Modeling"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2015-12-01","label":"Date Reported"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-04-08T11:58:40.082-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-21T10:34:05.846-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"other":[{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2015-12-01","label":"Date Reported"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-04-08T11:58:40.082-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-06-21T10:34:05.846-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Final Report","tableOfContents":""}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":3579820,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-04-08T17:57:43.000Z","name":"SpruceFir&ClimateChange_DamatoNECSC_FINALREPORT.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__7e\/e9\/74\/7ee97486eab94c004ac386e79be47199a5ea703c","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5707f150e4b06fa6ac664531?f=__disk__7e%2Fe9%2F74%2F7ee97486eab94c004ac386e79be47199a5ea703c"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5707f150e4b06fa6ac664531","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalProjectRep.zip","files":""}],"csc":"Northeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c648de4b0546c0c397b43","people":["Anthony  D'Amato"],"orgs":["Northeast CSC"],"children":[]},"537e3421e4b05ed6215c09e3":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/52138ccbe4b0b08f44619bd9","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Looking for age-related growth decline in natural forests: unexpected biomass patterns from tree rings and simulated mortality","relatedTitle":"Modeling Effects of Climate Change on Spruce-Fir Forest Ecosystems and Associated Priority Bird Populations","id":"537e3421e4b05ed6215c09e3","relatedId":"52138ccbe4b0b08f44619bd9","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/537e3421e4b05ed6215c09e3","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Modeling Effects of Climate Change on Spruce-Fir Forest Ecosystems and Associated Priority Bird Populations","relatedTitle":"Looking for age-related growth decline in natural forests: unexpected biomass patterns from tree rings and simulated mortality","id":"52138ccbe4b0b08f44619bd9","relatedId":"537e3421e4b05ed6215c09e3","annotation":null}]},"id":"537e3421e4b05ed6215c09e3","title":"Looking for age-related growth decline in natural forests: unexpected biomass patterns from tree rings and simulated mortality","body":"Abstract (from:&nbsp; \n<a href=\"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00442-014-2881-2\">http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00442-014-2881-2<\/a>):&nbsp;Forest biomass growth is almost universally assumed to peak early in stand development, near canopy closure, after which it will plateau or decline. The chronosequence and plot remeasurement approaches used to establish the decline pattern suffer from limitations and coarse temporal detail. We combined annual tree ring measurements and mortality models to address two questions: first, how do assumptions about tree growth and mortality influence reconstructions of biomass growth? Second, under what circumstances does biomass production follow the model that peaks early, then declines? We integrated three stochastic mortality models with a census tree-ring data set from eight temperate forest types to reconstruct stand-level biomass increments (in Minnesota, USA). We compared growth patterns among mortality models, forest types and stands. Timing of peak biomass growth varied significantly among mortality models, peaking 20\u201330&nbsp;years earlier when mortality was random with respect to tree growth and size, than when mortality favored slow-growing individuals. Random or u-shaped mortality (highest in small or large trees) produced peak growth 25\u201330&nbsp;% higher than the surviving tree sample alone. Growth trends for even-aged, monospecific&nbsp; \n<em>Pinus banksiana<\/em>&nbsp;or&nbsp; \n<em>Acer saccharum<\/em>&nbsp;forests were similar to the early peak and decline expectation. However, we observed continually increasing biomass growth in older, low-productivity forests of \n<em>Quercus rubra<\/em>,&nbsp; \n<em>Fraxinus nigra<\/em>, and&nbsp; \n<em>Thuja occidentalis<\/em>. Tree-ring reconstructions estimated annual changes in live biomass growth and identified more diverse development patterns than previous methods. These detailed, long-term patterns of biomass development are crucial for detecting recent growth responses to global change and modeling future forest dynamics.","parentId":"5213c934e4b0b08f4461a3cc","contacts":[{"name":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jane R.

In mountains, ecotones are compressed and act as potential harbingers of species shifts that accompany climate change. As the climate warms in New England, USA, high-elevation boreal forests are expected to recede upslope, with northern hardwood species moving up behind. Yet recent empirical studies present conflicting findings on this dynamic, reporting both rapid upward ecotonal shifts and concurrent increases in boreal species within the region. These discrepancies may result from the limited spatial extent of observations. We developed a method to model and map the montane forest ecotone using Landsat imagery to observe change at scales not possible for plot-based studies, covering mountain peaks over 39&nbsp;000&nbsp;km2. Our results show that ecotones shifted downward or stayed stable on most mountains between 1991 and 2010, but also shifted upward in some cases (13\u201315% slopes). On average, upper ecotone boundaries moved down \u22121.5&nbsp;m&nbsp;yr\u22121&nbsp;in the Green Mountains, VT, and \u22121.3&nbsp;m&nbsp;yr\u22121&nbsp;in the White Mountains, NH. These changes agree with remeasured forest inventory data from Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, and suggest that processes of boreal forest recovery from prior red spruce decline, or human land use and disturbance, may swamp out any signal of climate-mediated migration in this ecosystem. This approach represents a powerful framework for evaluating similar ecotonal dynamics in other mountainous regions of the globe.","parentId":"5213c934e4b0b08f4461a3cc","contacts":[{"name":"Jane R.

Efforts to quantify UVEG C have been limited to field-intensive studies or broad-scale modelling approaches lacking field measurements. Although large-scale inventories of UVEG C are not common, species- and community-level inventories of vegetation structure are available and may prove useful in quantifying UVEG C stocks. This analysis developed a general framework for estimating UVEG C stocks by employing per cent cover estimates of UVEG from a region-wide forest inventory coupled with an estimate of maximum UVEG C across the US Lake States (i.e. Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin). Estimates of UVEG C stocks from this approach reasonably align with expected C stocks in the study region, ranging from 0.86 &plusmn; 0.06 Mg ha\u22121&nbsp;in red pine-dominated to 1.59 &plusmn; 0.06 Mg ha\u22121&nbsp;for aspen\/birch-dominated forest types. Although the data employed here were originally collected to assess broad-scale forest structure and diversity, this study proposes a framework for using UVEG inventories as a foundation for estimating C stocks in an often overlooked, yet important ecosystem C pool.","materialRequestInstructions":"<h5>For assistance accessing this publication, please contact the publication author.<\/h5>","parentId":"5213c934e4b0b08f4461a3cc","contacts":[{"name":"Matthew B.

Given that many of these strategies deviate from traditional approaches to forest management, there is a great need for field evaluations of adaptation in practice to inform long-term planning efforts to address climate change impacts.&nbsp; Similarly, the long timeframes over which forests develop and management actions operate has increased the importance of decision support tools, such as forest and landscape-simulation models, to evaluate forest conservation practices under future climate change scenarios. This webinar will highlight the importance of field-based studies for assessing the effectiveness of adaptation strategies at addressing climate change and invasive species impacts and will provide an example of how landscape simulation models are being applied to identify forest conservation priorities for highly vulnerable, spruce-fir ecosystems in the northeastern United States.","parentId":"5213c957e4b0b08f4461a3d6","contacts":[{"name":"Anthony D'Amato","type":"Author","email":"damato@umn.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"D'Amato","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Northeast Climate Science Center","oldPartyId":59613,"type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","active":true,"aliases":["NECSC","Northeast CSC"],"fbmsCodes":["GGHCEN0507"],"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"Northeast Climate Science Center - Location","mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/necsc.umass.edu\/webinars\/developing-forest-adaptation-strategies-northern-forests-uncertain-future%20","title":"Webinar: 2014-10-1","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-10-01","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-03-26T10:34:42.307-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-26T10:35:53.122-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2014","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-03-26T10:34:42.307-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-03-26T10:35:53.122-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Website","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"Northeast CSC","parent_id":"4f8c648de4b0546c0c397b43","people":["Anthony D'Amato"],"orgs":["Northeast Climate Science Center"],"children":[]}}}}},"52ab5361e4b078ad3e41b0d1":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"52ab5361e4b078ad3e41b0d1","title":"Understanding Conservation Management Decisions in the Face of Sea-Level Rise Along the U.S. Atlantic Coast","body":"<p>Coastal ecosystems in the Eastern U.S. have been severely altered by processes associated with human development, including drainage of wetlands, changes in hydrology, land clearing, agricultural and forestry activity, and the construction of structures that \"harden\" the coast. Sea-level rise and the changing frequency of extreme events associated with climate change are now further degrading the capacity of those ecological and social systems to remain resilient. As custodians of ecological goods and services valued by society, coastal National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) have an especially important role to play in helping socio-ecological systems adapt to global-change processes.&nbsp;To help refuges address this challenge, we articulated a two-track decision problem faced by coastal refuge managers. The first track focuses on efficient allocation of limited staff time and budgets for management of existing programs under the current refuge design. The second track recognizes the negative impacts of global-change processes on the ability to maintain societal values derived from the existing refuge configuration. Over the long term, refuge managers must decide when and where to acquire or protect new land or&nbsp;habitat to supplement or replace the existing refuge footprint, to sustain values as the system evolves over time. Each track suggests a unique set of alternatives to represent differences in the identity of the decision maker(s) and in the spatial, temporal, and governance scales of the decision problem. We developed a prototype decision structure by describing how a hierarchical set of objectives and alternative actions can be used to explore the tradeoffs inherent in making short and long-term adaptation decisions. The prototype attempts to characterize a balance between decisions within the purview of the refuge itself and decisions made at higher organizational levels concerning reconfiguration of the refuge, which may be required to ensure the long-term persistence of societal values.<br> <br> <strong>This project is jointly supported by the Northeast Climate Science Center and the Southeast Climate Science Center.&nbsp;<\/strong><br> &nbsp;<\/p>","parentId":"526eaacce4b044919baee8fd","linkParentIds":["52604642e4b04eaeeb44eda8"],"contacts":[{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","active":true,"aliases":["Northeast CSC","NECSC"],"fbmsCodes":["GGHCEN0507"],"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"Northeast Climate Science Center - Location","mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","active":true,"aliases":["SECSC","Southeast CSC","NCCWSC SE (CSC)"],"fbmsCodes":["GGHCEN0502","GGHCGR0502"],"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"Southeast Climate Science Center - Location","mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Elizabeth Pienaar","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Florida"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Nathan J Wood","oldPartyId":11427,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"nwood@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Geographer","firstName":"Nathan","middleName":"J","lastName":"Wood","cellPhone":"3609916235","organization":{"displayText":"Western Geographic Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"5032513470","officePhone":"5032513291","streetAddress":{"zip":"97201","city":"Portland","state":"OR","line1":"2130 S.W.

Based on the North American Breeding Bird Survey","body":"<div> Appropriate ecological indicators of climate change can be used to measure concurrent changes in ecological systems, inform management decisions, and potentially to project the consequences of climate change. However, many of the available indicators for North American birds do not account for imperfect observation. We propose to use correlated-detection occupancy models to develop indicators from the North American Breeding Bird Survey data. The indicators will be used to test hypotheses regarding changes in range and distribution of breeding birds. The results will support the Northeast Climate Science Center\u2019s Science Agenda, including the science priority: researching ecological vulnerability and species response to climate variability and change.&nbsp; <\/div>","parentId":"53173f66e4b0cd4cd83be25c","contacts":[{"name":"James D Nichols","oldPartyId":7478,"type":"Principal

of global change on current and future species distributions. Projections based on widely used static modeling methods implicitly assume that species are in equilibrium with the environment and that detection during surveys is perfect. We used multiseason correlated detection occupancy models, which avoid these assumptions, to relate climate data to distributional shifts of Louisiana Waterthrush in the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. We summarized these shifts with indices of range size and position and compared them to the same indices obtained using more basic modeling approaches. Detection rates during point counts in BBS surveys were low, and models that ignored imperfect detection severely underestimated the proportion of area occupied and slightly overestimated mean latitude. Static models indicated Louisiana Waterthrush distribution was most closely associated with moderate temperatures, while dynamic occupancy models indicated that initial occupancy was associated with diurnal temperature ranges and colonization of sites was associated with moderate precipitation. Overall, the proportion of area occupied and mean latitude changed little during the 1997-2013 study period. Near-term forecasts of species distribution generated by dynamic models were more similar to subsequently observed distributions than forecasts from static models. Occupancy models incorporating a finite mixture model on detection - a new extension to correlated detection occupancy models - were better supported and may reduce bias associated with detection heterogeneity. We argue that replacing phenomenological static models with more mechanistic dynamic models can improve projections of future species distributions. In turn, better projections can improve biodiversity forecasts, management decisions, and understanding of global change biology.","parentId":"544a7a77e4b03653c63f88ee","contacts":[{"name":"Matthew J Clement","oldPartyId":62527,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"mclement@usgs.gov","jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Matthew","middleName":"J","lastName":"Clement","organization":{"displayText":"Patuxent Wildlife Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"3014975709","streetAddress":{"zip":"20708","city":"Laurel","state":"MD","line1":"12100 Beech Forest Road"},"buildingCode":"ACE","name":"CN=Matthew J Clement,OU=Users,OU=LaurelMD-S,OU=ER,DC=gs,DC=doi,DC=net -

In light of these concerns, our proposal aims to (1) develop high-resolution, state-of-the-art projections of snow depth\/cover, lake ice fraction\/thickness, and winter severity across the Great Lakes Basin for the mid- and late 21st century and (2) assess the impacts of these projected changes in winter conditions on the abundance and distribution of deer and waterfowl. A subset of global climate models from the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Five, representing a range of likely climate change outcomes for the basin, will be dynamically downscaled to 25-km using a regional climate model, interactively coupled to a lake model to represent the Great Lakes. These downscaled projections of snowpack, lake ice, air temperature, and winter severity index will be the foundation of projections of mid- and late 21st century distributions of deer and waterfowl and aid in adaptation planning to manage wildlife and fish populations. Expected products include (1) an interactive downscaled climate projections website and associated publicly-available datasets, (2) refined projections of waterfowl distribution in the Great Lakes\/eastern North America region through an open-access web-based conservation tool, (3) presentations at the annual Midwest Fish and Wildlife Conference and Wildlife Society Conference, and (4) scientific publications which target the impacts community, through the Journal of Wildlife Management and Journal of Great Lakes Research.

Implications of Climate Change Induced Shifts in Phenology of Coastal Fish and Wildlife Species in the Northeast Climate Science Center Region","body":"<div> Climate change is causing species to shift their phenology, or the timing of recurring life events such as migration and spawning, in variable and complex ways. This can potentially result in mismatches or asynchronies in food and habitat resources that negatively impact individual fitness, population dynamics, and ecosystem function. Numerous studies have evaluated phenological shifts in terrestrial species, particularly birds and plants, yet far fewer evaluations have been conducted for marine animals. This project seeks to improve our understanding of shifts in the timing of seasonal migration, spawning or breeding, and biological development (i.e. life stages present, dominant) of coastal fishes and migratory waterbirds along the U.S Atlantic coast. The suite of species selected will include ecologically important coastal predatory fishes that also support recreational and commercial fisheries such as striped bass, bluefish, and flounder; coastal migratory waterbirds of conservation concern such as plovers, terns, and egrets; and forage fishes such as herring and menhaden. Ideally the suite of species selected will allow us to compare whether fish and waterbird predators are shifting their phenology at different rates than their primary prey and optimal habitat conditions, thus influencing trophic interactions and population dynamics. Where sufficient long-term species observations and environmental monitoring data exist, the following questions will be evaluated using ecological modelling and statistical techniques: (1) Can phenological shifts of key coastal fish and waterbirds be detected and at what spatial and temporal scales? (2) What environmental variables are correlated with observed shifts in phenology? (3) Are there key attributes of species that appear to result in the presence or absence of phenological shifts? A comprehensive literature review will be conducted simultaneous to data collection and synthesis to determine what is known, and what knowledge\/information\/data gaps exist regarding regional phenological responses of coastal species to climate change. Project results will help managers assess the vulnerability of coastal species to climate change by providing information on how they are responding to impacts in the region.<br>\n&nbsp; <\/div>","parentId":"53173f66e4b0cd4cd83be25c","contacts":[{"name":"Adrian  Jordaan","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"ajordaan@eco.umass.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"413-545-2758","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"01003-9285","country":"USA","city":"Amherst","state":"MA","line1":"309 Holdsworth Hall\r\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation\r\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation\r\nUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst\r\n160 Holdsworth Way"}}},{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Michelle D Staudinger","oldPartyId":58319,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"mstaudinger@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Post Doc","firstName":"Michelle","middleName":"D","lastName":"Staudinger","organization":{"displayText":"Northeast Climate Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"4135452202","officePhone":"4135771318","streetAddress":{"zip":"01003","city":"Amherst","state":"MA","line1":"134 MORRILL SCIENCE CENTER (611 N.

Datasets will primarily come from long-term fishery independent monitoring programs (e.g., NEFSC bottom trawl survey; State trawl, seine, river, fish ladder surveys), but may also include fishery-dependent data (e.g. catch logs). The suite of species selected will allow us to compare whether populations from different trophic levels are shifting the timing of their seasonal migrations (i.e., phenology) in and out of northeastern habitats (e.g., inshore\/offshore; latitudinal) at different rates, thus influencing trophic interactions and population dynamics. Where sufficient long-term species observations (e.g., abundance, occurrence) and environmental monitoring data (e.g., SST) exist, we will use ecological and statistical modelling techniques to evaluate whether phenological shifts can be explained\/correlated to climatological, oceanographic or other variables.

This project proposes development of a spatial decision support system (DSS) to assist the LCC community and partner resource management agencies across the MRB in addressing these issues. The DSS will be designed to identify select geographic areas (watersheds) within the MRB where application of conservation practices can simultaneously (1) reduce nutrient export to the Gulf hypoxia zone and (2) enhance habitat and conservation for grassland and riparian bird species, based on identifying (3) landowners who are willing and capable of effectively implementing these practices. The DSS will be used to identify appropriate conservation practices to be implemented and to quantify resulting benefits for both nutrient export and riparian\/grassland birds. The DSS will also enable analyses of whether landowner willingness to implement desired practices is affected by perceptions of future climate extremes. Background: This project has support and includes contributions and collaboration from LCCs and participating agencies throughout the MRB, including federal and state conservation agencies, NGOs, and universities. The project, a pilot for a larger future effort, seeks to help move current opportunistic conservation approaches to a more strategic level by locating projects in critical watersheds to achieve the greatest overall conservation benefit. While significant research is currently invested in decision support tools for designing alternatives for future adaptation of policies and management strategies for responding to climate change and extremes, limited research exists that improves understanding of how learning, attitudes and decision making by land owners and managers shape adaptation and resilient livelihoods beyond climate risks. This project will significantly improve understanding of what motivates landowners to adopt conservation practices, filling what is presently a critical information gap. Procedures\/Methods: One component of the project involves development and application of the structure and components of the DSS itself. This will involve identifying a suite of focal watersheds for DSS applications in 3-4 regions of the MRB, based on criteria provided by LCC staff and other resource managers, as well as developing a set of four sub-models that comprise the DSS: (1) a species habitat sub-model for grassland and riparian bird species of concern, (2) a surface hydrology sub-model, (3) a best management practices (BMP) sub-model based on a subset of NRCS BMPs, and (4) a sub-model reflecting information on the locations of landowners who are willing and capable implementing desired BMPs, and how their preferences for applying conservation practices on the ground might change based on perceptions of future climate extremes. The second project component involves linking or interfacing the newly developed DSS with WRESTORE, an existing interactive and participatory modeling framework developed for designing alternatives of conservation practices via web-based interaction with stakeholder communities. This will be useful for fine tuning or refining output from the new DSS to design spatial plans for locating conservation practices in watersheds of interest. The third project component will involve detailed on-site surveys of land owners and managers in carefully selected watersheds. The intent is to significantly improve current understanding of what motivates landowners to adopt specific conservation practices, and how their motivation and preference might change in the face of extreme climate events. This information will inform design of the fourth sub-model in the DSS. Products and Information Transfer: Products will include the DSS application and underlying source code, data sets that underpin the DSS with reference to its application to focal MRB watersheds, data and maps resulting from DSS applications, results of landowner surveys and their interpretation, and related information. This array of project results and information will be of interest to 7 LCCs, state and federal land and resource management agencies, and NGOs in the MRB. Hence, we will employ various methods to disseminate information to the expected user community. We will publish results in technical reports and scientific publications, and present and discuss results as well as DSS applications at meetings with LCC staff and resource managers. We will serve the main results online (hosted by UMESC and\/or ETPBR LCC), including the DSS application and source code, a web application that provides access to maps of DSS output. <\/div>","parentId":"53173f66e4b0cd4cd83be25c","linkParentIds":["5318d138e4b0ae6e9d5a3c40"],"contacts":[{"name":"Jack Waide","oldPartyId":10834,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"waidej@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Supervisory Ecologist","personalTitle":"Mr.","firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Waide","cellPhone":"6083859354","organization":{"displayText":"Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"6087836066","officePhone":"6087816269","streetAddress":{"zip":"54603","country":"US","city":"La Crosse","state":"WI","line1":"2630 Fanta Reed Road"},"buildingCode":"ARF","name":"Jack Waide\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"54603","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"301","city":"La Crosse","state":"WI","line1":"2630 Fanta Reed Road"},"building":"UMESC"}},{"name":"Jason Rohweder","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"jrohweder@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"6087816228","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"54603","country":"USA","city":"La Crosse","state":"WI","line1":"2630 Fanta Reed Road"}}},{"name":"Timothy Fox","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"tfox@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"USGS UMESC"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"null","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"null","state":"null","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"Linda Prokopy","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"lprokopy@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Purdue University"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"null","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"null","state":"null","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"Meghna Babbar-Sebens","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"mbabbar@gmail.com","organization":{"displayText":"Oregon State University"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"null","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"null","state":"null","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Gwen White","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Eastern Tallgrass Prairie & Big Rivers Landscape Conservation Cooperative"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"South Central CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Northeast CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"},{"name":"Gulf Hypoxia"},{"name":"Bird Conservation"},{"name":"Decision Support System"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-05-28","label":"Start Date"},"1":{"type":"End","dateString":"2016-05-28","label":"End Date"},"2":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-12-03T12:09:09.876-07:00","label":"Date Created"},"3":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-23T10:16:16.619-07:00","label":"Last Updated"},"start":"2014","end":"2016","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-12-03T12:09:09.876-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-23T10:16:16.619-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"General Public Summary","value":"USFWS Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) throughout the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) have identified high nutrient runoff, a major contributor to Gulf hypoxia, and declines in wildlife populations (especially grassland and riparian birds), as conservation challenges requiring collaborative action.

Floodplain Conservation Lands under Non-Stationary Conditions","body":"<div> Recent extreme floods on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers (1993, 1995, 1997, 2007, 2010, and 2011) have motivated expansion of floodplain conservation lands. Within the state of Missouri, for example, there are more than 85,000 acres of State and Federally owned conservation lands in large-river floodplains. Floodplain lands are highly dynamic and challenging to manage. Variable exchanges of water, sediment, nutrients, and carbon between the river and the floodplain result in a diverse, productive, and ever-changing mosaic of habitat patches. In addition to conservation benefits, these lands have the potential to provide valuable ecosystem services like habitats, nutrient processing, carbon sequestration, and flood-water storage that produce economic values in terms of recreational spending, improved water quality, and decreased flood hazards. As hydrologic conditions in upstream watersheds vary due to climate change, land-use change, and changes in reservoir management - so-called non-stationary conditions - management challenges are compounded. Managers face questions about how decisions made today - such as which lands to acquire, design of vegetation restorations, decisions to invest in water-management infrastructure - will be affected by the hydroclimatic conditions of the future.&nbsp;The objective of this project is to formalize understanding of information needs for management of floodplain conservation lands so the right information is available at the right time. <\/div>","purpose":"Floodplains owe their high biodiversity and productivity to their dynamic interactions with rivers. At the same time, floodplains provide productive soils, level land, and abundant water resources that have driven agricultural, urban, and industrial development. Extreme floods on the Mississippi and Missouri rivers 1993 \u2013 2011 provided opportunities for conversions of damaged floodplain lands from agriculture to conservation. Within the state of Missouri there are more than 85,000 acres of State and Federally owned conservation lands along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, and additional lands are under various conservation easements. Management approaches range from active (water distribution and food crops for waterfowl production) to passive (for the benefit of biodiversity and ecological processes). The former involves extensive infrastructure for managing water, vegetation, and biota, whereas the latter aims to manage within a range of natural variability. Recently these conservation lands have also attracted attention for their potential to contribute to ecosystem services, in particular flood-risk reduction, nutrient processing, and carbon sequestration. Management of these floodplain lands has always been challenging because of the inherent dynamics of large rivers and their floodplains, and the fact that these lands exist within a mosaic of other land uses, dominantly agriculture. The prospect of managing floodplains for conservation objectives under non-stationary hydroclimatic conditions is even more daunting. Managers face uncertainties ranging from site-specific designs for water infrastructure to long-term land acquisition strategies. These decisions are central to managing floodplain lands for resiliency and adaptation to support conservation objectives, but they will also be informed by land and water-management decisions that are made by others, including adjacent land owners and upstream stakeholders. This project is designed as the first step needed to build a foundation for floodplain management and restoration decisions under nonstationary conditions. The project will address problem definition, hydroclimatic and geomorphic context, information needs, and initial development of tools and datasets to address those needs. We will begin with a workshop with managers of large-river floodplain conservation lands along the Middle Mississippi and Missouri Rivers \u2013 this will include state and federal agencies, and NGOs such as TNC and Ducks Unlimited. The workshop will be used to formalize management decision making in a conceptual model and to identify key information needs. We will include representatives from the dammed Upper Mississippi River, the open Middle Mississippi River, and the Missouri River to cover a large breadth of hydroclimatic and geomorphic conditions. The results of the first workshop will be used to define a science strategy which will include: a) formalizing and distributing one or more conceptual models, b) quantifying the range of hydroclimatic and geomorphic context in these rivers to establish representative conditions and where to focus future work, c) compiling historical hydrologic datasets and existing modeled hydrology based on downscaled climate-change data to compare historical and future predictions, d) develop basic analysis tools (with emphasis on coupled surface-water and groundwater models, wetland productivity) at the right level of resolution and complexity to address management questions, and e) pilot test the analysis tools in one or more locations to illustrate linkage and sensitivity of on-site conditions to historic and future conditions. With the results of a-e in hand, we will convene a second workshop to frame the results in a structured decision making context and define a strategy to fill information gaps.","parentId":"53173f66e4b0cd4cd83be25c","contacts":[{"name":"Robert Jacobson","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"rjacobson@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Columbia Environmental Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"5738761844","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"65201","country":"USA","city":"Columbia","state":"MO","line1":"4200 New Haven Road"}}},{"name":"Kenneth Lubinski","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"klubinski@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"6087816297","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"54603","country":"USA","city":"La Crosse","state":"WI","line1":"2630 Fanta Reed Road"}}},{"name":"Craig Paukert","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"paukertc@missouri.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Missouri-USGS Cooperative Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"573-882-3524","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"65211","country":"USA","city":"Columbia","state":"MO","line1":"302 ABNR"}}},{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"David Galat","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Missouri"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Lisa Webb","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Cooperative Research Units and the University of Missouri"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Keith Goyne","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Missouri"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project","Data"],"browseTypes":["Shapefile","Downloadable","Map Service","OGC WMS Layer","OGC WFS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder","Downloadable","Mappable"],"tags":[{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Northeast CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"},{"name":"Floodplain management"},{"name":"Floodplain ecology"},{"name":"Flood mitigation"},{"name":"climate change"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-04-23","label":"Start Date"},"1":{"type":"End","dateString":"2016-04-23","label":"End Date"},"2":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-12-03T08:01:47.759-07:00","label":"Date Created"},"3":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-23T10:17:02.786-07:00","label":"Last Updated"},"start":"2014","end":"2016","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-12-03T08:01:47.759-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-23T10:17:02.786-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"General Public Summary","value":"Recent extreme floods on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers (1993, 1995, 1997, 2007, 2010, and 2011) have motivated expansion of floodplain conservation lands.

Stream Thermal Habitat under Climate Change","body":"<div>Water temperatures are warming in lakes and streams, resulting in the loss of many native fish. Given clear passage, coldwater stream fishes can take refuge upstream when larger streams become too warm. Likewise, many Midwestern lakes \u201cthermally stratify\u201d resulting in warmer waters on top of deeper, cooler waters. Many of these lakes are connected to threatened streams. To date, assessments of the effects of climate change on fish have mostly ignored lakes, and focused instead on streams. Because surface waters represent a network of habitats, an integrated assessment of stream and lake temperatures under climate change is necessary for decision-making.<br>\n<br>\nThis work will inform the preservation of lake\/stream linkages, prioritization restoration strategies, and stocking efforts for sport fish. This project will employ state-of-the-science methods to model historical and future thermal habitat for nearly ten thousand lakes.

Lakes and streams provide diverse thermal habitat for many fish species, and connections between these ecosystems can be exploited by mobile biota as a climate change adaptation strategy. Given clear passage, coldwater stream fishes can take refuge in headwater streams providing suitable thermal habitat when higher order streams become too warm. Likewise, many temperate lakes thermally stratify and their deeper cold waters offer refugia from warming surface waters and connected streams. These intra- and inter-ecosystem connections are dynamic and influenced by multiple factors, including the spatial arrangement of thermal conditions, the degree of fragmentation in the hydroscape (e.g., road culverts and dams), and cycles of drought or heavy precipitation. To date, assessments of the effects of climate change on fishes have ignored the coupled nature of lakes and streams and instead have focused on each component individually. Because lentic and lotic ecosystems represent an interconnected network of aquatic habitats, an integrated assessment of thermal refugia under climate change is necessary for informed decision making regarding the preservation of lake\/stream linkages, prioritization of fish passageways and restoration strategies, and targeted stocking efforts for high-value game fish. Fishery biologists, biogeochemists, and ecologists recognize temperature as a master factor of aquatic ecosystem processes. While existing NE CSC and UMGL LCC projects have generated regional databases of stream connectivity and historical stream water temperatures, a complementary assemblage of lake temperature data does not exist. Similarly, previous work has projected suitable fish habitat for streams throughout the NE CSC region under various climate change scenarios, allowing managers to prioritize stocking, riparian habitat restoration, and land acquisition activities to most efficiently and effectively conserve stream fish habitat under climate change. The absence of complementary lake temperature data means that similar prioritization efforts to understand and conserve lake thermal habitat is impossible, and that connections between stream and lake habitats are ignored. At present, the three state agencies in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan are using three different approaches to estimate future lake temperatures and to fill historical information gaps. These partner states are excited to collaborate on this proposal, which will generate lake temperature data using standardized, transparent, and repeatable methods that can be easily extended to other regions in the future. Our efforts will focus on a subset of the NE CSC region (the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan) where we have engaged with research partners and are familiar with challenges to accessing the regional data required for this analysis. This project will employ state-of-the-science methods to mechanistically hind-cast and forecast thermal habitat for nearly ten thousand lakes. These data will be combined with existing observations of fish occurrence and abundance, stream connectivity, and stream temperature data to predict suitable fish thermal habitat across lakes and streams. Fish species will include representation from different thermal guilds and lentic\/lotic preferences. The integrated assessment performed will answer the following stakeholder-driven questions: How does the spatial arrangement of thermal characteristics in connected streams and lakes influence existing patterns of fish distribution? How will climate change affect fish thermal habitat in lakes and streams? Can connectivity among aquatic habitats result in recolonization of ecosystems projected to be periodically unsuitable due to warming? Our team is uniquely qualified to address these research questions, and includes hydrodynamic modelers, informaticists, aquatic ecologists, and fisheries biologists. We will be actively leveraging existing funding from the WI DNR, NCCWSC, and salary support from each institute and agency. We will generate and disseminate an integrated hind- and forecasted dataset of lake temperature profiles and associated fish-specific derivatives (e.g., growing degree days). These data, combined with the existing NE CSC and UMGL LCC datasets, will represent a substantial management tool and resource for the development of State Wildlife Action Plans.The results of this project will be used by partners and involved stakeholders to prioritize adaptation and restoration strategies across the region to preserve and enhance fish habitat while accounting for lakes and streams and source\/sink dynamics between populations in connected systems. We are exploring the possibility of hosting data generated by this proposal with the NorEaST data portal. Regardless, we will provide these data products openly and in machine-readable formats.\r\n"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Type","value":"Grant"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Number","value":"G15AP00158"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Type","value":"COA"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Number","value":"JS4304"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":87005.55,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":87005.55}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":2994,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-11-23T17:10:24.000Z","title":"Walleye -

While it is known that water clarity changes can alter lake water temperatures, it is unknown if frequently observed water clarity trends are sufficient to meaningfully impact the thermal trajectories of diverse lake populations. Using process-based modeling and empirical observations, this study demonstrates that water clarity changes of about 1% per year amplifies or suppresses warming at rates comparable to climate-induced warming. These results demonstrate that trends in water clarity, which are occurring in many lakes, may be as important as rising air temperatures in determining how waterbodies respond to climate change.\n<br> \n<br> These data support the following publication: &nbsp;\n<br> \n<br> Jordan S.

Recent declines in walleye and increases in largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and appropriate management actions for these important species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2151 lakes in Wisconsin, USA under contemporary (1989-2014) and future (2040-2064 and 2065-2089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment success and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake specific changes in each species under future climate conditions.&nbsp;\n<br> \n<br> These data support the following publication: &nbsp;\n<br> \n<br> Hansen, G.J.A., J.S.

Recent declines in walleye and increases in largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and appropriate management actions for these important species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, USA under contemporary (1989-2014) and future (2040-2064 and 2065-2089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment success and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 30-70% of lakes, and an increase to high largemouth bass relative abundance in 17-55% of additional lakes. The percentage of lakes with abundant largemouth bass and failed walleye recruitment was predicted to increase from 59% in contemporary conditions to 86% of lakes by mid-century and to 91% of lakes by late century, based on median projections across GCMs. Conversely, the number of lakes with successful walleye recruitment and low largemouth bass abundance was predicted to decline from 8.5% of lakes in contemporary conditions to only 38 1% of lakes in both future periods. Importantly, we identify nearly 100 resilient lakes predicted to continue to support walleye recruitment. Management resources could target preserving these resilient walleye populations.

Recent declines in walleye and increases in largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and appropriate management actions for these important species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, USA under contemporary (1989-2014) and future (2040-2064 and 2065-2089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment success and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 30-70% of lakes, and an increase to high largemouth bass relative abundance in 17-55% of additional lakes. The percentage of lakes with abundant largemouth bass and failed walleye recruitment was predicted to increase from 59% in contemporary conditions to 86% of lakes by mid-century and to 91% of lakes by late century, based on median projections across GCMs. Conversely, the number of lakes with successful walleye recruitment and low largemouth bass abundance was predicted to decline from 8.5% of lakes in contemporary conditions to only 38 1% of lakes in both future periods. Importantly, we identify nearly 100 resilient lakes predicted to continue to support walleye recruitment. Management resources could target preserving these resilient walleye populations.

Recent declines in walleye and increases in largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and appropriate management actions for these important species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, USA under contemporary (1989-2014) and future (2040-2064 and 2065-2089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment success and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 30-70% of lakes, and an increase to high largemouth bass relative abundance in 17-55% of additional lakes. The percentage of lakes with abundant largemouth bass and failed walleye recruitment was predicted to increase from 59% in contemporary conditions to 86% of lakes by mid-century and to 91% of lakes by late century, based on median projections across GCMs. Conversely, the number of lakes with successful walleye recruitment and low largemouth bass abundance was predicted to decline from 8.5% of lakes in contemporary conditions to only 38 1% of lakes in both future periods. Importantly, we identify nearly 100 resilient lakes predicted to continue to support walleye recruitment. Management resources could target preserving these resilient walleye populations.

Recent declining walleye and increasing largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and management actions for these species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake-specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, US, under contemporary (1989\u20132014) and future (2040\u20132064 and 2065\u20132089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake-specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 33\u201375% of lakes where recruitment is currently supported and a 27\u201360% increase in the number of lakes suitable for high largemouth bass abundance. The percentage of lakes capable of supporting abundant largemouth bass but failed walleye recruitment was predicted to increase from 58% in contemporary conditions to 86% by mid-century and to 91% of lakes by late century, based on median projections across GCMs. Conversely, the percentage of lakes with successful walleye recruitment and low largemouth bass abundance was predicted to decline from 9% of lakes in contemporary conditions to only 1% of lakes in both future periods. Importantly, we identify up to 85 resilient lakes predicted to continue to support natural walleye recruitment. Management resources could target preserving these resilient walleye populations.","parentId":"5519b6b8e4b032384278331f","linkParentIds":["54987053e4b07df8de5489d3"],"contacts":[{"name":"Gretchen Hansen","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"gretchen.hansen@state.mn.us","organization":{"displayText":"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jordan S Read","oldPartyId":60525,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"jread@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Civil Engineer","firstName":"Jordan","middleName":"S","lastName":"Read","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey, Office of Water Information"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"6088213817","officePhone":"6088213922","streetAddress":{"zip":"53562","city":"Middleton","state":"WI","line1":"8505 Research Way"},"buildingCode":"ARM","name":"Jordan S Read\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"53562-3581","country":"USA","city":"Middleton","state":"WI","line1":"8505 Research Way"},"building":"8505 Research Way"}},{"name":"Jonathan F.

Using a combination of observational and experimental data, we ask three questions aimed at determining the adaptive capacity of the species. 1) What is the potential for behavioral plasticity to mitigate climate impacts within populations? 2) Does within-population variation in climate tolerance provide a genetic pool that may facilitate adaptation? 3) Is there local adaptation to environmental conditions across the species\u2019 range? The information will aid in developing and relating Habitat Management Plans for FWS, Forest Management Plans for USFS, and General Management Plans for NPS resource managers across the range of the species. Second, the information can inform the development and application of other LCC-wide landscape projects, including the Designing Sustainable Landscapes (DSL) program.\r\nBackground. Methods used to predict species responses to climate change, such as static species distribution or habitat capacity modeling, have limited capacity to account for adaptive potential in forecasts of range shifts and population extinction risk. Understanding adaptive capacity in the red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) has implications for other rare or range-restricted Plethodon in particular, and forest resource condition and response to environmental change in general.\r\nMethods. We will use both observational and experimental methods. Observational data will focus on understanding how individuals and populations respond to spatial, seasonal, and annual differences in environmental conditions across the species\u2019 range. In addition, we will experimentally modify environmental conditions in both field and lab.\r\nProducts. The proposed project represents a truly regional approach to describing spatial variation in a common forest-dependent salamander species. This work will advance key priorities for the North Atlantic and Upper Midwest and Great Lakes Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) by providing ecologically relevant metrics for assessing management of forest ecosystems, and an understanding of the spatial variation in expected adaptive capacity of local populations to climate change. In addition, the spatial data may be used to validate and improve products from the LCC-funded Designing Sustainable Landscapes project; as most of the surrogate species used in the DSL are migratory birds, the data and inference from our proposed salamander work will provide a key independent dataset of a forest indicator species.\r\nPersonnel.

Native American tribes have collected and boiled down sap for centuries, and the tapping of maple trees is a cultural touchstone for many people in the northeast and Midwest. Because the tapping season is dependent on weather conditions, there is concern about the sustainability of maple sugaring as climate changes throughout the region. In spite of this, maple syrup production is increasing rapidly, with demand rising as more people appreciate this natural sweetener.<br>\n<br>\nThis research addresses the impact of climate on the quality of maple sap used to make maple syrup. Informed by the needs of state and federal resource managers, tribal groups, and other maple syrup producers, the researchers will examine the chemical composition of sap collected throughout the northeast, and relate this to variation in climate across the region. They will also examine sap from red maple, an alternative to sugar maple that is increasingly used to make syrup and a species that is expected to be less sensitive to climate change. This will allow the team to make projections of maple syrup quality under future climate conditions and under different management strategies. <\/div>","parentId":"55130c38e4b02e76d75c0752","contacts":[{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Kristina Stinson","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Toni L Morelli","oldPartyId":68124,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"tmorelli@usgs.gov","active":true,"firstName":"Toni","middleName":"L","lastName":"Morelli","cellPhone":"3139190191","organization":{"displayText":"National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center and Climate Science Centers"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"4135452515","streetAddress":{"zip":"01003","country":"US","city":"Amherst","state":"MA","line1":"134 Morrill Science Center (611 N.

Implications for Management","body":"<div>Climate change poses a variety of threats to biodiversity. Most efforts to assess the likely impacts of climate change on biodiversity try to rank species based on their vulnerability under changed environmental conditions. These efforts have generally not considered the ability of organisms to adjust their phenotype to the changing environment. Organisms can do this by one of two ways. First, they can undergo adaptive evolutionary change. Second, they can adjust their phenotype via non-evolutionary pathways. Both of these factors could substantially change species climate change vulnerability rankings. In this proposal, we will draw from a wide range of existing data to incorporate the ability of species to adjust their phenotype to climate change into vulnerability assessments. We will do this through a series of models that relate the extent to which a species\u2019 physical environment will change to the number of individuals likely to remain. Our models will allow a detailed comparison of vulnerability to climate change with and without evolutionary adaptive change and will include some possible management actions that augment a species\u2019 capacity for this adaptive change. Our research will fill a major knowledge gap and provide a substantial step forward in species vulnerability assessments.<\/div>\n","parentId":"55130c38e4b02e76d75c0752","contacts":[{"name":"Benjamin Letcher","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"bletcher@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Conte Anadromous Fish Research Laboratory, LSC"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"4138633803","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"01376-0796","country":"USA","city":"Turners Falls","state":"MA","line1":"One Migratory Way, P.O.

Incorporation of an organism\u2019s intrinsic adaptive capacity (in an evolutionary sense) into vulnerability assessments has the potential to change management decisions. Once intrinsic adaptive capacity is taken into consideration, the ranking of species vulnerabilities might change and management strategies might be altered. In this proposal we will quantitatively incorporate intrinsic adaptive capacity into species vulnerability assessments. We will develop a novel species vulnerability framework that explicitly includes adaptive capacity. We will then use demographic and evolutionary models to overlay a wide range of taxa (e.g. plants, mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, fishes, and insects) encompassing a wide variety of life-histories in the NE CSC region onto this framework. Finally, we will ground truth our novel approach with a detailed examination of climate change vulnerability of three species with the most available empirical data. We will use our results to define and develop decision support tools for conservation and management options that include population and species-level intrinsic adaptive capacity.

Robust models of stream temperature are critical as the climate changes, but estimating daily stream temperature poses several important challenges. We developed a statistical model that accounts for many challenges that can make stream temperature estimation difficult. Our model identifies the yearly period when air and water temperature are synchronized, accommodates hysteresis, incorporates time lags, deals with missing data and autocorrelation and can include external drivers. In a small stream network, the model performed well (RMSE = 0.59\u00b0C), identified a clear warming trend (0.63 \u00b0C decade<\/span><sup>\u22121<\/sup><span>) and a widening of the synchronized period (29 d decade<\/span><sup>\u22121<\/sup><span>). We also carefully evaluated how missing data influenced predictions. Missing data within a year had a small effect on performance (\u223c0.05% average drop in RMSE with 10% fewer days with data). Missing all data for a year decreased performance (\u223c0.6 \u00b0C jump in RMSE), but this decrease was moderated when data were available from other streams in the network.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["551b0253e4b0323842783958"],"contacts":[{"name":"Benjamin Letcher","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"bletcher@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Daniel Hocking","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"dhocking@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Kyle O'Neil","type":"Author","contactType":"person"},{"name":"Andrew R.

Project goals will be accomplished by performing the following tasks: 1) Explicitly incorporate land use and climate change projections into hydrologic models to determine effects on stream flow, including changes in streamflow volumes, timing of runoff, and frequency of extreme events; 2) Develop economic and physical measures of floodplain performance that capture the environmental services provided and the losses associated with changing flow regimes, 3) Evaluate how the effectiveness of green infrastructure strategies, including floodplain protection and storage, would alter these effects, 4) Develop a structured decision-making framework that incorporates short-term streamflow forecasting, environmental services damage functions, and adaptive management strategies. <\/div>","purpose":"G15AP00121","parentId":"55130c38e4b02e76d75c0752","contacts":[{"name":"Richard Palmer","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"palmer@ecs.umass.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"413-577-2401","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"01003-9293","country":"USA","city":"Amherst","state":"Massachusetts","line1":"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering\r\n222 Marston Hall\r\n130 Natural Resources Road\r\nUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst"}}},{"name":"Keith  Nislow","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"knislow@eco.umass.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"(413) 545-1765","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"01003","country":"USA","city":"Amherst","state":"MA","line1":"201 Holdsworth Hall"}}},{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Cathy Bozek","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"The Nature Conservancy"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Kathryn Kennedy","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"The Nature Conservancy"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Kim Lutz","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"The Nature Conservancy"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Christian O.

Each Tribe is unique in terms of its cultural, economic, geographic, jurisdictional, social, and political situation. As sovereign governments exercising self-determination, Tribes will have greater capacity to adapt if they are able to determine how climate science research can serve their governance priorities. To help address this our project is designed to make use of the latest research and policy developments on Tribal climate change adaptation and mitigation stemming from a number of key efforts which include, but are not limited to, the development of: 2013 Special Issue of Climatic Change: \u201cClimate Change and Indigenous Peoples in the United States: Impacts, Experiences and Actions\u201d; Chapter 12 of 2014 National Climate Assessment: \u201cIndigenous Peoples, Lands and Resources\u201d; and \u201cManajiwin: Respecting Tribes, First Nations and Cultural Resources in Cooperative Landscape and Climate Change Decision Making,\u201d Upper Midwest\/Great Lakes LCC. These projects and initiatives have generated key insights about how Tribes can use their own sources of knowledge and climate science for addressing climate change issues. This project seeks to stand on the shoulders of the insights generated by these projects and initiatives. The primary activity of this project will be for SDI to facilitate a relationship between a set of Tribes in the Northeast and the NE CSC that will produce, for each participating Tribe, a set of future climate change scenarios. The scenarios will serve both to identify climate change impacts unique to each participating Tribe and to propose solutions for adaptation and mitigation that are relevant for each scenario. The scenarios can be used as the basis for motivating more extensive Tribal adaptation plans, justifying future Tribal adaptation\/mitigation projects, and creating the foundation for more sophisticated collaborations between Tribes, other parties and the NE CSC that harness robust risk analysis, decision tools and strategic foresight methods. The scenarios, then, will serve as the basis for characterizing climate change impacts and solutions.\r\n\r\nSDI has already developed and piloted a method for facilitating relationships between Tribes and a climate science organization (GLISA) through the project, \u201cSupporting Tribal Climate Change Adaptation Planning through Community Participatory Strategic Foresight Scenario Development\u201d (funded by GLISA). The method involves first identifying a decision-making institution with each Tribe, such as a Natural Resources Department or Conservation Committee or Planning Agency. This institution then provides information on the geographic and jurisdictional boundaries that matter for understanding the climate change impacts relevant to the Tribe and the feasible solutions the Tribe could undertake. With this information, the climate science organization creates a localized climate change impacts profile that is tailored to the Tribe\u2019s geographic and jurisdictional boundaries. The localized profile is next used to design a workshop in which a set of Tribal members, elected officials, employees and any other relevant parties convene to create a set of 3-5 scenarios the Tribe faces based on the localized profile. Before the workshop, SDI will work with the institutions over the course of several meetings to identify, map and structure the values (from treaty rights to the timing of ceremonies to subsistence hunting), climate change impacts and potential that should figure in the workshop. The particular Tribe will determine how to represent the values, impacts and capacities. This information is used to structure the conversation during the workshops. After the workshop, SDI drafts the scenarios for feedback from the participants, and eventually produces final scenarios for each Tribe. Key to this method is that each Tribe (A) designs, at the conceptual phase, the structure of the workshop, values and relevant impacts, (B) controls how its traditional knowledges are included and represented and (C) has the right to ownership of the scenarios. (A), (B) and (C) are at the cutting edge of how the risks of interactions between Tribes and climate science organizations are understood based on the projects and initiatives listed earlier. The method also ensures respect for Tribal self-determination since the decision-making institutions work to determine the role of climate science research in relation to its own governance.\r\n\r\nProject Outcomes\r\n1.\tReport on Recommending the Role of the NE CSC in supporting Tribal scenario development.\r\n2.\tReview of existing published literature that fulfills the

our coasts are also home to many fish, wildlife, and plant species that are important for recreation, tourism, local economies, biodiversity, and healthy coastal ecosystems. Coastal habitats also provide protective \"ecosystem services\" to human communities, which are increasingly at risk to storms and sea level rise under future climate change. Understanding how climate change will impact natural and human communities is a crucial part of decision making and management related to the protection of our coasts.<br>\n<br>\nIn an ongoing collaborative project between the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative and the Northeast Climate Science Center, researchers have been compiling existing <a href=\"http:\/\/northatlanticlcc.org\/products\/thresholds-for-coastal-species-and-habitats\">threshold information on priority coastal fish, wildlife, and plant species<\/a> as well as coastal habitats along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and Caribbean in response to sea level rise and storm projections. As the effects of climate change on ecological and human communities grow, the possibility of crossing tipping points or thresholds of viability increases the potential for rapid and possibly irreversible changes in ecosystems. Understanding thresholds related to climate change could help to prevent more costly and possibly catastrophic effects in the near and distant future.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nThis project will further synthesize thresholds related to other climate driven stressors in addition to sea level rise and storms for priority species. It will compile natural and nature-based approaches to restoration and management that benefit both natural and human communities in the coastal zone, as well as synthesize information on the suite of ecosystem services provided by tidal marshes, beaches and barrier islands, mangroves, and shellfish beds. &nbsp;This work will inform climate change adaptation and resilience planning and assist coastal communities that must weigh important tradeoffs regarding the benefits and drawbacks of green and grey coastal infrastructure.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nResults from these synthesis activities will be presented in several formats, including easily accessible topic-specific web pages in the online <a href=\"https:\/\/climateactiontool.org\/\">Massachusetts Wildlife Climate Action Tool<\/a>. <\/div>","parentId":"57b35c25e4b03bcb01039660","contacts":[{"name":"Michelle D Staudinger","oldPartyId":58319,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"mstaudinger@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Post Doc","firstName":"Michelle","middleName":"D","lastName":"Staudinger","organization":{"displayText":"Northeast Climate Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"4135452202","officePhone":"4135771318","streetAddress":{"zip":"01003","city":"Amherst","state":"MA","line1":"134 Morrill Science Center (611 N.

Crossing these thresholds could lead to rapid change or decline in the health of a wildlife population.<br>\n<br>\nIn response to this need, a team of researchers is working to identify the primary drivers (climate change vs. urban growth) of changes in the distribution of wildlife in the Northeast and examine potential changes in their distribution over time in order to identify possible biological thresholds that would significantly alter the biology and health of wildlife populations. The team will also determine how changing temperature and precipitation will influence wildlife interactions and tree and bird species, as well as examine how specific events, like extreme storms, may be correlated to biological thresholds. This project will focus on species of conservation concern in the Northeast and Midwest, including eastern tree species, songbirds, moose, Canada lynx, snowshoe hare, and southern pine beetle.

Natural resource managers looking to maintain ecological function and species persistence have asked Northeast Climate Science Center scientists to predict how climate change will affect species. In order to better predict ecological responses, an interdisciplinary team is working to understand the mechanisms that are driving these changes, including any thresholds that might soon be crossed. Leveraging the research that has already been supported by the Northeast Climate Science Center and its partners, this project will use the latest modeling techniques combined with robust field data to examine the impact of specific climate variables, land use change, and species interactions on the future distribution and abundance of species of conservation concern. This project will document biological thresholds related to climate change for species of conservation concern in the Northeastern and Midwestern U.S. Specifically, our objectives are to identify how warming and precipitation changes, as well as urban growth, will affect species distribution, abundance, and interactions. We will particularly analyze existing data for any climate thresholds that can be linked to known biological thresholds that can inform management.

Using existing long-term historical data series, they will determine the direction and magnitude of how migration, abundance, or other phenological factors have changed for marine mammals, sea turtles, and fishes that migrate into the Gulf of Maine on a seasonal basis. Because marine animals are inherently difficult to detect, the team will apply dynamic occupancy models to evaluate seasonal migration patterns and habitat use across multiple habitats in the Gulf of Maine region. The project team will also synthesize regional information on a key, ecologically-important prey fish, sandlance, whose timing and abundance is a strong predictor of the occurrence and behavior of predator species targeted in this study as well as a range of other regional fish and wildlife of conservation and management concern.<br>\n<br>\nResults from this project will identify coastal fish and wildlife species that are relatively more or less able to adapt and thus potentially vulnerable to climate change; determine the likely primary drivers of those changes; and identify data gaps and future monitoring needs. Ultimately, this information will be available and useful for regional coastal management and adaptation decisions that will allow managers to effectively plan for the future.&nbsp; <\/div>","parentId":"57b35c25e4b03bcb01039660","contacts":[{"name":"Michelle Staudinger","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"mstaudinger@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"4135771318","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"20192-0002","country":"USA","city":"Reston","state":"VA","line1":"12201 Sunrise Valley Drive, Mail Stop 400"}}},{"name":"John Prescott","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"dpendleton@neaq.org","organization":{"displayText":"New England Aquarium"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"(207) 321-8697","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"Boston","state":"MA","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"Adrian Jordaan","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"ajordaan@eco.umass.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"(413) 545-2758","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"01003","country":"null","city":"Amherst","state":"MA","line1":"160 Holdsworth Way"}}},{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Daniel Pendleton","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"John H Prescott Marine Laboratory, New England Aquarium"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"https:\/\/necsc.umass.edu\/projects\/how-and-why-timing-and-occurrence-seasonal-migrants-gulf-maine-changing-due-climate","rel":"related","title":"Northeast CSC Project Page","hidden":false}],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Northeast CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2016"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"phenology"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"migration"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"distribution"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"coastal resiliency"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"marine ecology"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"endangered species"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"marine mammals"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"forage fish"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"sea turtles"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Start","dateString":"2016","label":"Start Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-08-16T13:02:29.030-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-23T09:57:36.617-07:00","label":"Last Updated"},"start":"2016","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-08-16T13:02:29.030-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-23T09:57:36.617-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"phase":"Draft DMP","dataProduct":[{"metadata":"TBDIdentify the metadata standard that will be used to describe the data and products (FGDC, ISO, EML, etc.)","citation":"Pendleton, Staudinger, and Jordaan.Specify how the project\u2019s data should be cited.","format":"Maps and data plots will be created in ArcGIS and R, respectively to visualize where and over what time scales phenological shifts have been observed for individual species.

To achieve this objective, we will convene stakeholder working groups, co-develop alternative scenarios, and develop and apply models to help managers and conservation organizations develop \u2018win-win\u2019 solutions to climate change adaptation.","parentId":"57b35c25e4b03bcb01039660","contacts":[{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Richard Palmer","oldPartyId":68826,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"palmer@ecs.umass.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Palmer","organization":{"displayText":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Keith H Nislow","oldPartyId":51442,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","onlineResource":"http:\/\/www.nrs.fs.fed.us\/people\/knislow","email":"knislow@fs.fed.us","description":"My research deals with the relationship between land use, aquatic habitat, and the distribution and abundance of fish and aquatic invertebrates.

In the first year, we will use GIS databases to assess the locations of all dams in\r\ntributaries of Lake Michigan within the state of Wisconsin. For each one, aerial imagery will be\r\nused to evaluate the degree of upstream ponding and likely sediment retention, and land cover\r\ndata will be distilled to quantitatively summarize land use patterns in each watershed (agriculture\r\nvs. urban vs.forest vs. wetland). At a subset of dams, field sampling will confirm inferences\r\nfrom GIS databases, and enable empirical comparisons of nutrient concentrations upstream vs.\r\ndownstream of the dam.\r\nIn the second year, we will work with Dr. Peter Esselman from USGS' Great Lakes Science\r\nCenter and Dr. Dale Robertson from USGS' Wisconsin Water Center to estimate annual nutrient\r\nloads to Lake Michigan from each watershed, and the potential role that dams could play in both\r\nslowing the flow of water to Lake Michigan and reducing loads of nitrogen (via denitrification)\r\nand phosphorus (via sediment retention).\r\nThis will involve modeling the relationship between land use and nutrient yield for the region,\r\nand then adapting these generalized models to the watersheds of Wisconsin. This collaborative\r\neffort will build on Esselman's earlier work on statistical relationships between land use and\r\nnutrient yields in the Great Lakes, and Robertson's adaptation of SPARROW models to Great\r\nLakes watersheds. This work will yield an integrative set of models predicting which dams are\r\nmost likely to mediate nutrient loads to Lake Michigan.\r\nIn the third year, we will reconcile inferences about nutrient load mediation with McIntyre's dam\r\nremoval prioritization framework for fish passage. These two major management goals are\r\ngenerally considered in isolation. Our work will directly compare the two, and use a joint\r\nprioritization approach to identify individual dams where tradeoffs between restoring fish\r\npassage and increasing nutrient loads would be minimized. These results will be conveyed to the\r\nstakeholder community through workshops and meetings, to ensure that this dualistic\r\nunderstanding is incorporated into restoration prioritization and on-the-ground efforts of agencies\r\nand NGOs throughout the Great Lakes region. Funding from the NECSC will support 7.5\r\nmonths of graduate student salary in each year of the project. The graduate student, under the\r\ndirection of the project team, will lead the landcover and GIS analyses for all study watersheds."}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Type","value":"Cooperative Agreement"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Number","value":"G16AC00257"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":155885.33,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2016","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":155885.33}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":800,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-08-26T19:52:12.000Z","title":"Connecticut River, CC0 Public Domain","imageHeight":600,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/57b35743e4b03bcb01039642?f=__disk__6f%2Fe2%2F45%2F6fe245f97a4202dfb67689c9e9af3fd5b2738c35","processed":false,"size":128061,"useForPreview":true,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d9aad644ebde3f60f53db685293f92ed"},"name":"800px-View_of_Connecticut_River_-_Hadley_Falls_Canal_Park -

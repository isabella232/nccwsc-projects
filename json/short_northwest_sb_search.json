Finally, implementation of hydrologic modifications depends on communication of benefits and costs to stakeholders who may choose to implement these modifications.","type":["Project"],"parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46"},"19":{"id":"570f5f9be4b0ef3b7ca3294b","fy":"Unknown","title":"Applications of genetic data to improve management and conservation of river fishes and their habitats","authors":["Kim T Scribner","Winsor H.

Genetic data can be used with landscape models and traditional ecological assessment data to identify biodiversity hotspots, predict ecosystem responses to anthropogenic effects, and detect impairments to underlying processes. We show that by combining taxonomic, demographic, and genetic data of species in complex riverscapes, managers can better understand the spatial and temporal scales over which environmental processes and disturbance influence biodiversity. We describe how population genetic models using empirical or simulated genetic data quantify effects of environmental processes affecting species diversity and distribution.

Therefore, the reduced production, or absence, of cheatgrass in previously invaded areas during years of adequate precipitation could be seen as a windfall. However, this cheatgrass dieoff phenomenon creates other problems for land managers such as accelerated soil erosion, loss of early spring food supply for livestock and wildlife, and unknown recovery pathways.

Using a novel combination of snow, geohydrology, and sediment transport models we assessed the vulnerability of stream channels to changing peak streamflow. Our snow modeling shows that with just a 2\u00b0C warming, snowfall shifts to rainfall at all elevations, peak snowpacks occur over two months earlier, and snowpacks are reduced by over half of historical values. Our geohydrology modeling shows that greater rainfall and earlier snowmelt enhances peak winter streamflows but impacts depend on snow amount and watershed geohydrology.

Wildfire activity is widely projected to increase in response to climate change in the Northwest, but we currently lack a comprehensive understanding of what this increase will look like or what its impacts will be on a variety of ecological and hydrologic systems. This project is addressing one critical part of those impacts: the islands of unburned vegetation within wildfires. Unburned islands occur naturally as wildfires burn across landscapes, and are important habitat refuges for species; places where plants and animals survive the fire and subsequently regenerate across the recently burned landscape. Since they are naturally resistant to burning, understanding how climate change impacts these islands will help us understand what species may be in even more danger from wildfires if these refuges disappear.

Our team assembled recent developments in change detection mapping and species modeling.&nbsp;Specifically, our objectives were to: (1) use 32-year data on bird distributions to test the reliability of climate envelope models, (2) test whether changes in climate are linked to bird population declines over the past 32 years and, (3) assess the relative importance of climate versus landscape change in explaining changes in species distributions.","type":["Project"],"parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46"},"259":{"id":"5751dffee4b053f0edd03e12","fy":"Unknown","title":"Divergence of ecosystem services in U.S. National Forests and Grasslands under a changing climate","authors":["Kai Duan","Ge Sun","Shanlei Sun","Peter V.

This study investigates the potential impacts of climate change on two key ecosystem functions (i.e., water yield and ecosystem productivity) using the most recent climate projections derived from 20 Global Climate Models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). We find that future climate change may result in a significant reduction in water yield but an increase in ecosystem productivity in NFs. On average, gross ecosystem productivity is projected to increase by 76 ~ 229 g C m\u22122 yr\u22121 (8% ~ 24%) while water yield is projected to decrease by 18 ~ 31 mm yr\u22121 (4% ~ 7%) by 2100 as a result of the combination of increased air temperature (+1.8 ~ +5.2 \u00b0C) and precipitation (+17 ~ +51 mm yr\u22121).

Failure to consider both effects on evolutionary dynamics simultaneously can lead to incomplete, spurious, or erroneous conclusions about the mechanisms driving genomic variation.

Such projections are based upon the assumptions that (1) species respond primarily to broad-scale climatic regimes, or (2) that variation in climate at fine spatial scales is less relevant at coarse spatial scales. However, in montane forest landscapes, high degrees of microclimate variability could influence occupancy dynamics and distributions of forest species. Using high-resolution bird survey and under-canopy air temperature data, we tested the hypothesis that the high vagility of most forest bird species combined with the heterogeneous thermal regime of mountain landscapes would enable them to adjust initial settlement decisions to track their thermal niches.","type":["Publication"],"parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46"},"346":{"id":"55aee3e8e4b09a3b01b51a09","fy":"Unknown","title":"Model Outputs","authors":null,"csc":["Northwest CSC"],"keywords":"No tags associated with this item.","dates":{"other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-07-21T18:29:28.856-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-08-13T13:48:36.588-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"status":"Unknown","author-orgs":["No organizations associated with this item."],"body":"No Abstract Available for this item.","type":"Unknown","parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46"},"347":{"id":"561bf56fe4b0cdb063e5837f","fy":"Unknown","title":"Modeled snow-water-equivalent, absolute difference between April 1 historical and projected values under T2 climate change scenario, McKenzie River Basin, Oregon [full and clipped versions]","authors":null,"csc":["Northwest CSC"],"keywords":["snow water equivalent","climate change","precipitation","McKenzie River Basin","Oregon"],"dates":{"pub":"2015","other":[{"type":"Info","dateString":"2015-05-01","label":"Time Period"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-10-12T12:01:19.100-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-03-01T10:10:19.344-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"status":"Unknown","author-orgs":["No organizations associated with this item."],"body":"The absolute difference between mean modeled snow-water-equivalent (meters) on April 1 for the reference (1989-2011) climate period and mean modeled snow-water-equivalent on April 1 for the T2 climate change scenario.

As with the statewide analysis (see WHCWG 2010), the normalized least-cost corridor algorithms produced wall-to-wall linkage maps, with everygrid cell in the study area having a value that represented its deviation from the nearest least-cost movement route. This necessitated creating maps that displayed only values from zero (the optimum modeled route) to a species-specific linkage width cutoff to identify areas that contribute most to connectivity between each HCA pair. Because of the smaller extent of this analysis and the finer-scale data that were available, we chose cutoff values (Table 2.2, WHCWG 2012) that produced linkage zone widths that were somewhat narrower than those mapped at the statewide scale, while being mindful of the intent that linkage zones serve not only focal species, but other species and processes as well.

Over the past century, however, populations have dramatically declined due to habitat loss, overharvest, and invasive species. Consequently, many populations are listed as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Complicating these stressors is global warming and associated climate change.

Stream temperatures fluctuate a lot during the year and temperature may or may not control where an insect lives. Field insects were collected and sent to a laboratory for testing several temperature endpoints, particularly at higher temperatures. Respiration, breathing rate, and some physical activities were expected to increase, as the insects attempt to deal with elevated temperatures and expected oxygen limitations.

Preliminary and published insights on climate responses of sagebrush and implications for vulnerability assessments and post-fire restoration were described. Responses of big sagebrush and competitors such as cheatgrass to climate manipulations are providing important insight on the ways in which sagebrush may resist or respond to warming or shifts in precipitation. Big sagebrush is a remarkably diverse species, and preliminary findings from common-garden studies are suggesting how the diversity is important for its climate responses and for selection of appropriate seed sources. Restoration success is largely a problem of initial seedling establishment, aside from post-restoration management and disturbance, and new studies are revealing how seedlings of different seed sources respond to climate and management treatments of herbs.","type":["Publication"],"parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46"},"511":{"id":"53175c10e4b0cd4cd83c5def","fy":"Unknown","title":"Seasonal Climate Variability and Change in the Pacific Northwest of the United States","authors":["John T.

We demonstrate an approach to select a subset of GCMs that incorporates both concepts and provides insights into the range of climate impacts. To represent how an ecosystem process responds to projected future changes, we methodically sample, using a simple sensitivity analysis, how an ecosystem variable responds locally to projected regional temperature and precipitation changes.

understanding of the patterns of movement is central to managing populations, communities, and the landscapes they use. We combined passive integrated transponder tagging over 4 years and strontium isotopes in otoliths to demonstrate that 25% of the mountain whitefish (\nProsopium williamsoni) sampled moved between the Methow and Columbia rivers, Washington, USA. Seasonal migrations downstream from the Methow River to the Columbia River to overwinter occurred in autumn and upstream movements in the spring.

The studies presented here examine trends in different socioecological values under different climate and management assumptions using a dynamic global vegetation model\/STSM approach. The authors found that simulated management actions did not prevent climate-induced vegetation change. Simulated management did in some cases promote desired forest structures and increase resilience to climate change. The chapter describes in detail the method that uses MC1 projections to create climate-informed STSMs. Finally, it explains the potential improvements and applications for future work, including a fully integrated approach using both the direct effect of climate change on vegetation and indirect e...","type":["Publication"],"parent_id":"4f8c64d2e4b0546c0c397b46"},"576":{"id":"57daf26de4b090824ffc3250","fy":"2016","title":"Using Genetic Information to Understand Drought Tolerance and Bark Beetle Resistance in Whitebark Pine Forests","authors":["Diana Six","Polly Buotte","Jeffrey A Hicke","Connie Millar","Mary Frances Mahalovich","Brytten Steed","Ruth Swaney"],"csc":["Northwest CSC"],"keywords":["CSC","Northwest CSC","2016","Forest adaptation","genetic screening","mountain pine beetle"],"dates":{"start":"2016","end":"2018","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-09-15T13:11:41.510-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-28T09:57:57.360-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"status":"In Progress","author-orgs":{"0":"The University of Montana","1":"University of Idaho","3":"U.S. Forest Service","6":"University of Montana"},"body":"Forests are of tremendous ecological and economic importance. They provide natural places for recreation, clean drinking water, and important habitats for fish and wildlife. However, the warmer temperatures and harsher droughts in the west that are related to climate change are causing die-offs of many trees. Outbreaks of insects, like the mountain pine beetle, that kill trees are also more likely in warmer, drier conditions.\n\nTo maintain healthy and functioning forest ecosystems, one action forest managers can take is to make management decisions that will help forests adapt to future climate change. However, adaptation is a process based on genetic change and few tools are currently available for managers to use to incorporate genetic information into management decision-making. Information is needed that links the responses of trees to environmental change and to develop genetic profiles of resistant trees.

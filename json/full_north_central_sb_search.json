What is needed now is an effort to refine the approach and establish a transportable methodology that is applicable across a wide range of ecosystems. In the Northern Rockies, managers have expressed an interest in exploring this approach at Glacier National Park, the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem, and the Rocky Mountain Front. This project utilized and evaluated the FRAME-SIMPPLLE approach to (1) explore adaptive management for climate and landscape change in the Northern Rockies, (2) recommend how to foster the long-term development of such collaborative planning tools as a joint effort between the USGS and the Institute of the Environment; (3) develop graduate student mentoring opportunities focused on collaborative planning and adaptive management science, and (4) investigate the use of GIS to further landscape science and conservation, especially related to energy development.<\/p>","parentId":"5006f6f6e4b0abf7ce733fab","contacts":[{"name":"Cathy Whitlock","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"whitlock@montana.edu","organization":{"displayText":"Montana State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Kathryn M Irvine","oldPartyId":24241,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"kirvine@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Statistician","firstName":"Kathryn","middleName":"M","lastName":"Irvine","organization":{"displayText":"Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"4069946556","officePhone":"4069947492","streetAddress":{"zip":"59715","country":"US","city":"Bozeman","state":"MT","line1":"2327 University Way, Suite 2"},"buildingCode":"KKO","name":"Kathryn M Irvine\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

One common example is when plant species cover\nis visually assessedwithin bounded quadrats and then assigned to pre-defined cover class\ncategories.We present an ordinal beta hurdle model that directly models ordinal category\nprobabilitieswith a biologically realistic beta-distributed latent variable.Ahurdle-at-zero\nmodel allows ecologists to explore distribution (absence) and abundance processes in an\nintegrated framework. This provides an alternative to cumulative link models when data\nare inconsistent with the assumption that the odds ofmoving into a higher category are the\nsame for all categories (proportional odds). Graphical tools and a deviance information\ncriterion were developed to assess whether a hurdle-at-zero model should be used for\ninferences rather than standard ordinal methods. Hurdle-at-zero and non-hurdle ordinal\nmodels fit to vegetation cover class data produced substantially different conclusions.The\nordinal beta hurdle model yielded more precise parameter estimates than cumulative logit\nmodels, although out-of-sample predictions were similar. The ordinal beta hurdle model\nprovides inferences directly on the latent biological variable of interest, percent cover,\nand supports exploration of more realistic ecological patterns and processes through the\nhurdle-at-zero or two-part specification.We provide JAGS code as an on-line supplement.\nSupplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["502be20ae4b098307cc38ba2"],"contacts":[{"name":"Kathryn M.

Water resources include water quantity and water quality. Studies include physical, chemical, and isotopic analyses and numerical modeling. Much of our research focuses on groundwater recharge in desert basins and the impacts of climate variability and change and land use\/land cover change on recharge. Impacts of natural and anthropogenic sources of contamination on water quality are also addressed in many of our research studies. Our program is funded by federal sources including EPA and DOE and state sources including Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and Texas Water Development Board in addition to support from the Jackson School of Geosciences.\n\nThe Sustainable Water Resources Program is led by Bridget Scanlon and includes research scientists, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate research assistants working on different topics. Topics include estimation of groundwater recharge in semiarid and arid regions using field studies; evaluating impacts of climate variability (ENSO) on recharge, monitoring ecohydrologic controls on the water balance using remote and groundbased measurements, monitoring soil moisture, evaluating controls on groundwater arsenic contamination; and source attribution and processes affecting nutrients, particularly nitrate.","active":true,"jobTitle":"Senior Research Scientist","firstName":"Bridget","lastName":"Scanlon","organization":{"displayText":"UT at Austin"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"5124718241","streetAddress":[],"name":"Bridget  Scanlon\/BEG.UTEXAS.EDU - Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"78713-8924","city":"Austin","state":"TX","line2":"University of Texas","line1":"Bureau of Economic Geology, Jackson School of Geosciences"}}},{"name":"Kathleen Sherman","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/nca2014.globalchange.gov\/report\/regions\/great-plains","title":"National Climate Assessment","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"dates":{"0":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-04-27T10:49:24.266-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"1":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-21T15:40:55.187-07:00","label":"Last Updated"},"other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-04-27T10:49:24.266-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-21T15:40:55.187-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":" U.S. Global Change Research Program","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"pages","value":"441-461"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI","value":"i:10.7930\/J0D798B"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Chapter","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"North Central CSC","parent_id":"4f83509de4b0e84f60868124","people":["Mark Shafter","Dennis Ojima","John M.

This pilot study was organized around a set of specific management questions from our partner community. Issues related to species, landscape, and ecosystem natural resource connections were used to orient the pilot study across various scales of decision making.&nbsp;Considerations of various security and access issues for the user community were evaluated and guidelines were developed. Based on the workshop recommendations, a set of data, modeling, analysis, and an information exchange pilot study were undertaken to evaluate the current and projected capacity to analyze, archive, and distribute information across various IT infrastructure types. The outcome of the pilot study was an assessment report detailing the capability and constraints to analysis and information exchange between federal and non-federal installations, including public access to climate-relevant information. Components of the pilot study included: (1) downscaling of climate projections; (2) ecosystem, habitat, and wildlife modeling capacity; and (3) adaptive management. CSU developed an innovative platform for user-friendly information exchange, distributed analysis platform (e.g., cloud computing), inter-operable data and analysis interface, and supporting various decision-support systems that provide dramatically new views of data critical to supporting producers, decision-makers and researchers in analyzing climate-associated risk events and mitigating their

Water resources include water quantity and water quality. Studies include physical, chemical, and isotopic analyses and numerical modeling. Much of our research focuses on groundwater recharge in desert basins and the impacts of climate variability and change and land use\/land cover change on recharge. Impacts of natural and anthropogenic sources of contamination on water quality are also addressed in many of our research studies. Our program is funded by federal sources including EPA and DOE and state sources including Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and Texas Water Development Board in addition to support from the Jackson School of Geosciences.\n\nThe Sustainable Water Resources Program is led by Bridget Scanlon and includes research scientists, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate research assistants working on different topics. Topics include estimation of groundwater recharge in semiarid and arid regions using field studies; evaluating impacts of climate variability (ENSO) on recharge, monitoring ecohydrologic controls on the water balance using remote and groundbased measurements, monitoring soil moisture, evaluating controls on groundwater arsenic contamination; and source attribution and processes affecting nutrients, particularly nitrate.","active":true,"jobTitle":"Senior Research Scientist","firstName":"Bridget","lastName":"Scanlon","organization":{"displayText":"UT at Austin"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"5124718241","streetAddress":[],"name":"Bridget  Scanlon\/BEG.UTEXAS.EDU - Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"78713-8924","city":"Austin","state":"TX","line2":"University of Texas","line1":"Bureau of Economic Geology, Jackson School of Geosciences"}}},{"name":"Kathleen Sherman","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/nca2014.globalchange.gov\/report\/regions\/great-plains","title":"National Climate Assessment","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"dates":{"0":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-04-27T10:49:24.266-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"1":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-21T15:40:55.187-07:00","label":"Last Updated"},"other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-04-27T10:49:24.266-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-21T15:40:55.187-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":" U.S. Global Change Research Program","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"pages","value":"441-461"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI","value":"i:10.7930\/J0D798B"}],"edition":"","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Chapter","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"North Central CSC","parent_id":"4f83509de4b0e84f60868124","people":["Mark Shafter","Dennis Ojima","John M.

The objective was to develop a strategy for Information Technology to handle the various data, information, and computational services which the Climate Science Centers will be responsible to deliver. Particular attention was paid to Landscape Conservation Cooperative needs related to climate and impact information. The workshop covered issues related to distributed computing and data storage; information security issues across federal, state, university, and public portals; analysis across multiple scales and domains or sectors; and information exchange to multiple user communities. The workshop was charged with developing a framework that will serve the needs of the regional Climate Science Centers, which include local to regional, cross-regional, and national level

resource managers in our region to evaluate impacts of climatic changes and to develop strategies to respond to changes affecting their natural and cultural resources.&nbsp; These funded activities provided improved past and current climate data sets, such as the high resolution temperature data, regional reconstruction. In addition, we have developed climate information from the latest international climate projections. We used this information and additional climate information to evaluate and assess impacts on ecosystem and natural resources. Ecosystem responses were studied across the region and included examples from controls on sagebrush establishment, whitebark pine vulnerability to climate change, grassland dynamics in mountain and prairie areas, and changes in water dynamics affecting water fowl in the prairie pothole area.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nAdaptation research efforts and development of strategies with various natural resource managers from federal, state, and Native American communities were carried out. A major focus on drought was defined and the Drought Risk and Adaptation in the Interior (DRAI) research efforts was developed under this funding. We used survey and interviews to gain insights in how various climate changes, especially those related to drought conditions, have been affecting their management practices. This information was important in guiding further research with our management communities related to what climate information would be useful, what impacts are being observed or of concern to these management entities, and what pathways are open to meet changes.<br>\n<br>\nOur research and engagement activities were generated in partnership with National Park Service managers, Native American leaders, and groups working with various non-governmental organizations, such as The Nature Conservancy. In addition, information on climate changes and impacts were incorporated in regional assessment efforts for the Colorado Vulnerability Study.","parentId":"504a0b13e4b02b6b9f7bd9ae","contacts":[{"name":"Dennis Ojima","oldPartyId":63239,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"Dennis.Ojima@colostate.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Ojima","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jill Lackett","oldPartyId":64647,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"Jill.Lackett@colostate.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Jill","lastName":"Lackett","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseTypes":["Report"],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2017-01","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2017-01-09T11:21:33.861-07:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2017-01-09T11:31:16.796-07:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2017","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2017-01-09T11:21:33.861-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2017-01-09T11:31:16.796-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":1334180,"useForPreview":false,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f40f8ef09f4a5a181ab4fd6ed76cb94f"},"dateUploaded":"2017-01-09T18:26:22.000Z","name":"FY12_G12AC20504_Final Report_revised01-04-2017.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__61\/94\/03\/619403f43eaee658800a16aa95fb412d72e2adac","title":"","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5873d4ade4b0a829a31e47cf?f=__disk__61%2F94%2F03%2F619403f43eaee658800a16aa95fb412d72e2adac"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5873d4ade4b0a829a31e47cf","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalReportforR.zip","files":""}],"csc":"North Central CSC","parent_id":"4f83509de4b0e84f60868124","people":["Dennis Ojima","Jill Lackett"],"children":[]}}},"504a0b1be4b02b6b9f7bd9b2":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"504a0b1be4b02b6b9f7bd9b2","title":"Other (Approved for Public)","parentId":"504a0af9e4b02b6b9f7bd9a7","systemTypes":["Folder"],"dates":{"0":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2012-09-07T08:56:27.501-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"1":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2012-09-07T08:56:27.501-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2012-09-07T08:56:27.501-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2012-09-07T08:56:27.501-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"North Central CSC","parent_id":"4f83509de4b0e84f60868124","children":[]}}},"5012aea7e4b05140039e0335":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"5012aea7e4b05140039e0335","title":"Integrating Climate and Biological Data into Land Management Decision Models to Assess Species and Habitat Vulnerability: A Collaboration for Greater Sage-\u00ad\u2010Grouse and their Habitats","body":"<p>Climate affects both the demographics of the Greater sage-grouse bird and the condition and long-term viability of their habitats, including sage-steppe communities.

This project aims to predict these effects of climate change on cottonwood and willow tree regeneration in western forests by linking models of seed dispersal timing, streamflow hydrology, and seedling establishment, focusing on the upper South Platte River Basin as a study area. Results will help land managers anticipate future changes in riparian wildlife habitat quality, and potentially to respond to these changes by actively re-vegetating high-priority areas, or by working with water management agencies to schedule dam releases that favor cottonwood and willow establishment.<\/p>\n","parentId":"5006f700e4b0abf7ce733fae","contacts":[{"name":"Dr. Patrick

Land Management, Natural Disturbance, and CO2 on Woody Encroachment in the Northern Great Plains in a Changing Climate","body":"<div>Maintaining the native prairie lands of the Northern Great Plains (NGP), which provide an important habitat for declining grassland species, requires anticipating the effects of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and climate change on the region\u2019s vegetation. Specifically, climate change threatens NGP grasslands by increasing the potential encroachment of native woody species into areas where they were previously only present in minor numbers. This project used a dynamic vegetation model to simulate vegetation type (grassland, shrubland, woodland, and forest) for the NGP for a range of projected future climates and relevant management scenarios. Comparing results of these simulations illustrates the sensitivity of woody encroachment projections to climate change factors. Improved understanding of the effects of increasing CO2, climate change, and land management practices on potential woody encroachment will be used to guide management practices to be most effective in protecting grassland habitat in the NGP into the future.<\/div>\n","parentId":"5006f700e4b0abf7ce733fae","contacts":[{"name":"Amy Symstad","oldPartyId":10172,"type":"Principal

the Northern Great Plains","body":"The dynamic global vegetation model MC1 simulates plant growth and biogeochemical cycles, vegetation type, wildfire, and their interactions. The model simulates competition between trees and grasses (including other herbaceous species), as affected by differential access to light and water, and fire-caused tree mortality (Bachelet et al., 2000; 2001). MC1 projects the dynamics of lifeforms, including evergreen and deciduous needleleaf and broadleaf trees, as well as C3 and C4 grasses. However, the model can also be parameterized for a particular dominant species of the associated lifeform. For this project we used two versions of MC1, both of which modified the standard code to improve the simulation of potential evapotranspiration (PET).For the western northern Great Plains (NGP) the model was calibrated to project the observed ecotone between ponderosa pine and grasslands at Wind Cave National Park in the Black Hills of South Dakota; full documentation of this version of the code is described by King et al.

MC1 is a new dynamic global vegetation model created to assess potential impacts of global climate change on ecosystem structure and function at a wide range of spatial scales from landscape to global. This new tool allows us to incorporate transient dynamics and make real time predictions about the patterns of ecological change. MC1 was created by combining physiologically based biogeographic rules defined in the MAPSS model with a modified version of the biogeochemical model, CENTURY.

However, the mechanisms that would cause such shifts are uncertain. Natural and anthropogenic fires have shaped the distributions of many plant species, but their effects have seldom been included in future projections of species ranges. Here, we examine how the combination of climate and fire influence historical and future distributions of the ponderosa pine\u2013prairie ecotone at the edge of the Black Hills in South Dakota, USA, as simulated by MC1, a dynamic global vegetation model that includes the effects of fire, climate, and atmospheric CO<sub>2<\/sub> concentration on vegetation dynamics. For this purpose, we parameterized MC1 for ponderosa pine in the Black Hills, designating the revised model as MC1-WCNP. Results show that fire frequency, as affected by humidity and temperature, is central to the simulation of historical prairies in the warmer lowlands versus woodlands in the cooler, moister highlands. Based on three downscaled general circulation model climate projections for the 21st century, we simulate greater frequencies of natural fire throughout the area due to substantial warming and, for two of the climate projections, lower relative humidity. However, established ponderosa pine forests are relatively fire resistant, and areas that were initially wooded remained so over the 21st century for most of our future climate x fire management scenarios. This result contrasts with projections for ponderosa pine based on climatic niches, which suggest that its suitable habitat in the Black Hills will be greatly diminished by the middle of the 21st century. We hypothesize that the differences between the future predictions from these two approaches are due in part to the inclusion of fire effects in MC1, and we highlight the importance of accounting for fire as managed by humans in assessing both historical species distributions and future climate change effects.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["504a02a6e4b02b6b9f7bd948","54fb1da9e4b02419550dbabd"],"contacts":[{"name":"David A.

PET is influenced by solar and longwave radiation, temperature, wind speed, and humidity, but it is often modeled as a function of temperature alone. This approach can cause biases in projections of future climate impacts in part because it confounds the effects of warming due to increased greenhouse gases with that which would be caused by increased radiation from the sun. We developed an algorithm for linking PET to extraterrestrial solar radiation (incoming top-of atmosphere solar radiation), as well as temperature and atmospheric water vapor pressure, and incorporated this algorithm into the dynamic global vegetation model MC1. We tested the new algorithm for the Northern Great Plains, USA, whose remaining grasslands are threatened by continuing woody encroachment. Both the new and the standard temperature-dependent MC1 algorithm adequately simulated current PET, as compared to the more rigorous PenPan model of Rotstayn et al. (2006). However, compared to the standard algorithm, the new algorithm projected a much more gradual increase in PET over the 21st century for three contrasting future climates. This difference led to lower simulated drought effects and hence greater woody encroachment with the new algorithm, illustrating the importance of more rigorous calculations of PET in ecological models dealing with climate change.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["504a02a6e4b02b6b9f7bd948","54fb1e69e4b02419550dbae2"],"contacts":[{"name":"David A.

The projections of general circulation models (GCMs) indicate the possible magnitude and direction of future climate change for a region, but the utility of these projections for more local scales, those of individual National Park Service (NPS) units, are more uncertain because the coarse-scale GCMs lack much of the topographic detail that alters local climates. In addition, complex, interacting effects of temperature, precipitation, atmospheric CO<sub>2<\/sub> concentrations, fire, and herbivores on the vegetation that is the foundational natural resource of many NPS units present challenges in assessing the effects of projected future climates on plant and animal assemblages managed by the NPS.<\/p>\n<p>In spring 2009, Wind Cave National Park (WICA) served as a case study in a workshop assessing the use of scenario planning as a tool for park management planning in the face of rapidly changing climate. One outcome of the workshop was the recognized need for quantitative models to better understand the range of possible vegetation changes under different future climates and management decisions. This report addresses this need; it describes our adaptation of a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) to WICA vegetation and the resulting projections of future vegetation under three future climate scenarios and 11 management scenarios determined by Park natural resource managers.<\/p>\n<p>Wind Cave National Park lies along a narrow transition zone between the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of the Black Hills and the mixed grass prairie that once extended with few interruptions over the lower, gentler terrain, subject to warmer, drier climate to the east and south of the Park. The location and character of this transition is strongly influenced by fire frequency and intensity (Brown and Sieg 1999). Furthermore, the mixed grass prairie occupies a broader transition zone between eastern tallgrass prairie and the shortgrass prairie of the western Great Plains. The dominance of species characteristic of these two prairie types varies with soil moisture availability, evaporative demand, and recent grazing history (Cogan et al. 1999). In addition, Wind Cave lies near the midpoint of a long gradient of C<sub>3<\/sub> (cool season) grass dominance to the north and C<sub>4<\/sub> (warm season) grass dominance to the south.<\/p>\n<p>The ecotonal position of WICA may make it particularly sensitive to climate change. For example, small changes in fire frequency and\/or intensity and the vigor of trees vs. grass could dramatically shift the proportions of these two lifeforms. The Park hydrology is also sensitive to changes in the balance between infiltration of precipitation and evapotranspiration, as on average, only a small fraction of annual precipitation reaches the deeper soil layers that feed permanent streamflow. The resources at risk at Wind Cave NP include the Cave itself, as well as small backcountry caves, a genetically important bison herd, and other prairie species including the black-tailed prairie dog and endangered black-footed ferrets. All of these resources will be directly affected by climate change impacts on vegetation and hydrology.<\/p>\n<p>Natural resource management challenges at WICA are substantial, diverse, and intertwined. Aboveground, the park has been recognized as exemplary for its high quality vegetation (Marriot et al. 1999), though the park is relatively small for the diversity of vegetation types and species that it supports. Even without a changing climate, maintaining the integrity of the plant communities is complicated by the park\u2019s legislated responsibility to maintain viable populations of bison, elk and pronghorn. In addition, the federally endangered black-footed ferret was recently re-introduced to the park. This species requires large extents of prairie dog towns for prey and habitat. Prairie dogs impact vegetation by constant clipping, grazing and soil disturbance, thereby affecting plant composition and productivity. Moreover, naturally high interannual climate variability and the strong influence of precipitation on grass productivity in this region combine to yield high interannual variability in the amount of forage available for the wildlife that the park is tasked to maintain. Finally, fire, which is now primarily controlled by WICA and NPS Northern Great Plains fire management programs, is intertwined with all other natural resource issues at WICA, as it can impact prairie dog colony and forest expansion, ungulate foraging behavior, invasive plant species, and hydrological processes.<\/p>\n<p>Although not capable of capturing all of these complexities, dynamic vegetation models do provide a means for quantitatively projecting vegetation futures in future climates under plausible fire and grazing regimes. Our work uses the DGVM MC1 to simulate the effects of future climate projections and management practices on the vegetation of WICA. MC1 is designed to project potential vegetation as influenced by natural processes and hence is appropriate for national parks, where conservation of native biota and ecosystems is of great importance.<\/p>\n<p>Since the initial application of MC1 to a small portion of WICA (Bachelet et al. 2000), the model has been altered to improve model performance with the inclusion of dynamic fire. Applying this improved version to WICA required substantial recalibration, during which we have made a number of improvements to MC1 that will be incorporated as permanent changes. In this report we document these changes and our calibration procedure following a brief overview of the model. We compare the projections of current vegetation to the current state of the park and present projections of vegetation dynamics under future climates downscaled from three GCMs selected to represent the existing range in available GCM projections. In doing so, we examine the consequences of different management options regarding fire and grazing, major aspects of biotic management at Wind Cave.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["504a02a6e4b02b6b9f7bd948","54fb1da9e4b02419550dbabd"],"contacts":[{"name":"David A.

climate station network in the western United States (U.S.) suggest that higher elevations are warming faster than lower elevations. This has led to the assumption that elevation-dependent warming is prevalent throughout the region with impacts to water resources and ecosystem services. Here we critically evaluate this network's temperature observations and show that extreme warming observed at higher elevations is the result of systematic artifacts and not climatic conditions. With artifacts removed, the network's 1991\u20132012 minimum temperature trend decreases from +1.16&deg;C decade\u22121&nbsp;to +0.106&deg;C decade\u22121&nbsp;and is statistically indistinguishable from lower elevation trends. Moreover, longer-term widely used gridded climate products propagate the spurious temperature trend, thereby amplifying 1981\u20132012 western U.S. elevation-dependent warming by +217 to +562%. In the context of a warming climate, this artificial amplification of mountain climate trends has likely compromised our ability to accurately attribute climate change impacts across the mountainous western U.S.","parentId":"504a0a49e4b02b6b9f7bd995","contacts":[{"name":"Jared Oyler","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Montana"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Solomon Dobrowski","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Montana"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Ashley P Ballantyne","oldPartyId":50676,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","description":"Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.","firstName":"Ashley","middleName":"P","lastName":"Ballantyne","organization":{"displayText":"University of Montana"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Anna E.

The use of such datasets is ubiquitous, but their inherent limitations are largely unknown or overlooked particularly in regard to spatial uncertainty and climate trends. To address these limitations, we present a statistical framework for producing a 30-arcsec (\u223c800-m) resolution gridded dataset of daily minimum and maximum temperature and related uncertainty from 1948 to 2012 for the conterminous United States. Like other datasets, we use weather station data and elevation-based predictors of temperature, but also implement a unique spatio-temporal interpolation that incorporates remotely sensed 1-km land skin temperature. The framework is able to capture several complex topoclimatic variations, including minimum temperature inversions, and represent spatial uncertainty in interpolated normal temperatures. Overall mean absolute errors for annual normal minimum and maximum temperature are 0.78 and 0.56 &deg;C, respectively. Homogenization of input station data also allows interpolated temperature trends to be more consistent with US Historical Climate Network trends compared to those of existing interpolated topoclimatic datasets. The framework and resulting temperature data can be an invaluable tool for spatially explicit ecological and hydrological modelling and for facilitating better end-user understanding and community-driven improvement of these widely used datasets.","parentId":"504a0a49e4b02b6b9f7bd995","contacts":[{"name":"Oyler, Jared W.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Montana, Missoula"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Ballantyne, Ashley","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Montana, Missoula"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jencso, Kelsey","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Montana, Missoula"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Sweet, Michael","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Montana, Missoula"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Running, Steven W.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Montana, Missoula"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"North Central CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/joc.4127\/abstract","title":"Oyler et al. 2014","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"Kriging"},{"name":"air temperature"},{"name":"land skin temperature"},{"name":"homogenization"},{"name":"MODIS"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2014-08-12","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-08-28T15:03:58.776-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-28T14:32:29.938-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2014","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-08-28T15:03:58.776-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-28T14:32:29.938-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"Article first published online: 12 AUG 2014","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"International Journal of Climatology","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"doi","value":"10.1002\/joc.4127"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"issn","value":"1097-0088"}],"edition":"","language":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Publisher","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"North Central CSC","parent_id":"4f83509de4b0e84f60868124","people":["Oyler, Jared W.","Ballantyne, Ashley","Jencso, Kelsey","Sweet, Michael","Running, Steven W."],"orgs":["North Central CSC"],"children":[]},"58334fe4e4b046f05f21f64c":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/504a01a7e4b02b6b9f7bd93e","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Final Report for Regional Extreme Climate Events: Gaining Understanding through Past and Present Observations and Modeling","relatedTitle":"Regional Extreme Climate Events: Gaining Understanding through Past and Present Observations and Modeling","id":"58334fe4e4b046f05f21f64c","relatedId":"504a01a7e4b02b6b9f7bd93e","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/58334fe4e4b046f05f21f64c","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Regional Extreme Climate Events: Gaining Understanding through Past and Present Observations and Modeling","relatedTitle":"Final Report for Regional Extreme Climate Events: Gaining Understanding through Past and Present Observations and Modeling","id":"504a01a7e4b02b6b9f7bd93e","relatedId":"58334fe4e4b046f05f21f64c","annotation":null}]},"id":"58334fe4e4b046f05f21f64c","title":"Final Report for Regional Extreme Climate Events: Gaining Understanding through Past and Present Observations and Modeling","body":"This research element supports vulnerability assessment for climate adaptation (Glick et al. 2011) by focusing on the provision of best available climate information for the region in order to inform analysis of ecosystem exposure to change.&nbsp;

The characteristic frequency, size, and intensity of fire are driven by interactions between top-down climate-driven and bottom-up fuel-related processes. Disentangling climatic from non-climatic drivers of past fire regimes is a grand challenge in Earth systems science, and a topic where both paleoecology and ecological modeling have made substantial contributions. In this manuscript, we (1) review the use of sedimentary charcoal as a fire proxy and the methods used in charcoal-based fire history reconstructions; (2) identify existing techniques for paleoecological modeling; and (3) evaluate opportunities for coupling of paleoecological and ecological modeling approaches to better understand the causes and consequences of past, present, and future fire activity.","parentId":"504a0a49e4b02b6b9f7bd995","contacts":[{"name":"Virginia Iglesias","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Montana State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Gabriel I.

Challenges in Species Distribution Modeling","body":"An important component in the fields of ecology and conservation biology is understanding the environmental conditions and geographic areas that are suitable for a given species to inhabit. A common tool in determining such areas is species distribution modeling which uses computer algorithms to determine the spatial distribution of organisms. Most commonly the correlative relationships between the organism and environmental variables are the primary consideration. The data requirements for this type of modeling consist of known presence and possibly absence locations of the species as well as the values of environmental or climatic covariates thought to define the species habitat suitability at these locations. These covariate data are generally extracted from remotely sensed imagery, interpolated\/gridded historical climate data, or downscaled climate model output. Traditionally, ecologists and biologists have constructed species distribution models using workflows and data that reside primarily on their local workstations or networks. This workflow is becoming challenging as scientists increasingly try to use these modeling techniques to inform management decisions under different climate change scenarios. This challenge stems from the fact that remote sensing products, gridded historical climate, and downscaled climate models are not only increasing in spatial and temporal resolution but proliferating as well. Any rigorous assessment of uncertainty requires a computationally intensive sensitivity analysis accounting for various sources of uncertainty. The scientists fitting these models generally do not have the background in computer science required to take advantage of recent advances in web-service based data acquisition, remote high-powered data processing, or scientific workflow systems. Ecologists in the field of modeling are in need of a tractable platform that abstracts the inherent computational complexity required to incorporate the burgeoning field of coupled climate and ecological response modeling. In this paper we describe the computational challenges in species distribution modeling and solutions using scientific workflow systems. We focus on the Software for Assisted Species Modeling (SAHM) a package within VisTrails, an open-source scientific workflow system.","parentId":"504a09c9e4b02b6b9f7bd989","contacts":[{"name":"Colin Talbert","oldPartyId":10199,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"talbertc@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"IT Specialist","firstName":"Colin","lastName":"Talbert","organization":{"displayText":"Fort Collins Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9702269230","streetAddress":{"zip":"80526-8118","country":"US","city":"Fort Collins","state":"CO","line1":"2150C Centre Avenue"},"buildingCode":"KBA","name":"Colin Talbert\/BRD\/CONT\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80526-8118","country":"USA","city":"Fort Collins","state":"CO","line1":"2150 Centre Avenue, Building C"},"building":"NRRC BLDG C"}},{"name":"Marian K Talbert","oldPartyId":23639,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"mtalbert@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Statistician","firstName":"Marian","middleName":"K","lastName":"Talbert","organization":{"displayText":"National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center and Climate Science Centers"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9702269230","streetAddress":{"zip":"80526-8118","country":"US","city":"Fort Collins","state":"CO","line1":"2150C Centre Avenue"},"buildingCode":"KBA","name":"Marian K Talbert\/BRD\/CONT\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80526-8118","country":"USA","city":"Fort Collins","state":"CO","line1":"2150 Centre Avenue, Building C"},"building":"NRRC BLDG C"}},{"name":"Jeffrey T Morisette","oldPartyId":12077,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"morisettej@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Center Director, North Central Climate Science Center","firstName":"Jeffrey","middleName":"T","lastName":"Morisette","organization":{"displayText":"National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center and Climate Science Centers"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"9702269230","streetAddress":{"zip":"80526-8118","country":"US","city":"Fort Collins","state":"CO","line1":"2150C Centre Avenue"},"buildingCode":"KBA","name":"Jeffrey T Morisette\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"80526-8118","country":"USA","city":"Fort Collins","state":"CO","line1":"2150 Centre Avenue, Building C"},"building":"NRRC BLDG C"}},{"name":"David Koop","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"New York University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"North Central CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/sites.computer.org\/debull\/A13dec\/p31.pdf","title":"Talbert et al. 2013","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"name":"species distribution modeling"},{"name":"Software for Assisted Species Modeling (SAHM)"},{"name":"VisTrails"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2012","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-01-24T09:45:54.804-07:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-22T15:13:19.696-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2012","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-01-24T09:45:54.804-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-22T15:13:19.696-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"IEEE Data Eng.

Developers can extend the functionality of the VisTrails system by creating custom modules for bundled VisTrails packages. The Invasive Species Science Branch of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Fort Collins Science Center (FORT) and the U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s North Central Climate Science Center have teamed up to develop and implement such a module\u2014the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM). SAHM expedites habitat modeling and helps maintain a record of the various input data, the steps before and after processing, and the modeling options incorporated in the construction of an ecological response model. There are four main advantages to using the SAHM:VisTrails combined package for species distribution modeling: (1) formalization and tractable recording of the entire modeling process; (2) easier collaboration through a common modeling framework; (3) a user-friendly graphical interface to manage file input, model runs, and output; and (4) extensibility to incorporate future and additional modeling routines and tools.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>In order to meet increased interest in the SAHM:VisTrails package, the FORT offers a training course twice a year. The course includes a combination of lecture, hands-on work, and discussion.

code","body":"This code was used in a simulated decision analysis project designed to evaluate the value of different kinds of information with regard to making optimal investments in invasive plant control programs. The code was developed in the R programming environment. The file \"sim_code.R\" contains the initialization of the parameters and analysis; the file \"pop_sim.ccp\" is a C++ program that executes the actual simulation and returns the results to R. We developed a hypothetical scenario in which a manager is tasked with control of invasive plants on 100 management units each 100 ha in size. 90 of these units were assumed to be under private management and 10 were assumed to be conservation units (i.e. under public management). For this problem we assumed that there were only two target species to control: leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) and yellow toadflax (Linaria vulgaris). These two species were identified of examples of species that are controlled within the LCC geography. They are also species for which there is some literature to help parameterize a model. We should note that this model is gross generalization and was not intended to provide insight into invasive species biology. Because this model is stochastic, we measured this objective as the number of years out of 50 that at least 50% of the units were uninfested. We arbitrarily chose the target of 50%, which could have been any value. However, we felt that because these species are so difficult to control, target of 50% was fairly attainable. The dynamics of the model assume that management units can either be infested with one of the species, both of them or none at all. We further assumed that once a unit was infested, the species immediately achieved some average density and began producing propagules. These propagules had to disperse some arbitrary distance before they could infest another unit. Once those seeds landed in an uninfested unit, there was some probability they would lead to an infestation. To describe infestation dynamics, we developed a model that was composed of eight states to describe the management units. The model simulates the dynamics of infestation and control and then produces an Expected Value of Information analysis that shows the improvement in performance given resolution of each uncertain parameter in the model.","purpose":"To evaluate the Epected Value of Information for resolving uncertainty in each model parameter. This analysis was intended to help prioritize which information would be most beneficial in improving invasive species management decisions.","parentId":"504a090fe4b02b6b9f7bd978","contacts":[{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey, Midwest Region","type":"Point of Contact","contactType":"organization","organizationsPerson":"Max Post van der Burg","email":"maxpostvanderburg@usgs.gov","jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"701-253-5553","officePhone":"701-253-5574","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"58401","city":"Jamestown","state":"ND","line1":"8711 37Th Street SE"}}},{"name":"Max Post van der Burg","type":"Originator","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Max Post van der Burg","type":"Metadata Contact","contactType":"person","email":"maxpostvanderburg@usgs.gov","jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey, Midwest Region"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"701-253-5553","officePhone":"701-253-5574","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"58401","city":"Jamestown","state":"ND","line1":"8711 37Th Street SE"}}},{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey -

In order to achieve this integration, some LCCs have adopted the approach of providing their partners with better scientific information in an effort to facilitate more effective and coordinated conservation decisions. Taking this approach has led many LCCs to begin funding research to provide the information for improved decision making. To ensure that funding goes to research projects with the highest likelihood of leading to more integrated broad scale conservation, some LCCs have also developed approaches for prioritizing which information needs will be of most benefit to their partnerships. We describe two case studies in which decision analytic tools were used to quantitatively assess the relative importance of information for decisions made by partners in the Plains and Prairie Potholes LCC. The results of the case studies point toward a few valuable lessons in terms of using these tools with LCCs. Decision analytic tools tend to help shift focus away from research oriented discussions and toward discussions about how information is used in making better decisions. However, many technical experts do not have enough knowledge about decision making contexts to fully inform the latter type of discussion. When assessed in the right decision context, however, decision analyses can point out where uncertainties actually affect optimal decisions and where they do not. This helps technical experts understand that not all research is valuable in improving decision making. But perhaps most importantly, our results suggest that decision analytic tools may be more useful for LCCs as way of developing integrated objectives for coordinating partner decisions across the landscape, rather than simply ranking research priorities.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["504a0913e4b02b6b9f7bd97a"],"contacts":[{"name":"Max Post van der Burg","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"maxpostvanderburg@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Catherine Cullinane Thomas","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"ccullinanethomas@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Tracy R.

activities on surrounding lands and global change. The magnitude of such change agents and the sensitivity of ecosystems to these agents vary among protected areas. Thus, there is a need to assess vulnerability across networks of protected areas to determine those most at risk and to lay the basis for developing effective adaptation strategies. We conducted an assessment of exposure of U.S. National Parks to climate and land use change and consequences for vegetation communities. We first defined park protected-area centered ecosystems (PACEs) based on ecological principles. We then drew on existing land use, invasive species, climate, and biome data sets and models to quantify exposure of PACEs from 1900 through 2100. Most PACEs experienced substantial change over the 20th century (&gt;740% average increase in housing density since 1940, 13% of vascular plants are presently nonnative, temperature increase of 1&deg;C\/100 yr since 1895 in 80% of PACEs), and projections suggest that many of these trends will continue at similar or increasingly greater rates (255% increase in housing density by 2100, temperature increase of 2.5&deg; - 4.5&deg;C\/100 yr, 30% of PACE areas may lose their current biomes by 2030). In the coming century, housing densities are projected to increase in PACEs at about 82% of the rate of since 1940. The rate of climate warming in the coming century is projected to be 2.5 - 5.8 times higher than that measured in the past century. Underlying these averages, exposure of individual park PACEs to change agents differ in important ways. For example, parks such as Great Smoky Mountains exhibit high land use and low climate exposure, others such as Great Sand Dunes exhibit low land use and high climate exposure, and a few such as Point Reyes exhibit high exposure on both axes. The cumulative and synergistic effects of such changes in land use, invasives, and climate are expected to dramatically impact ecosystem function and biodiversity in national parks. These results are foundational to developing effective adaptation strategies and suggest policies to better safeguard parks under broad-scale environmental change.","parentId":"504a0aa8e4b02b6b9f7bd9a1","contacts":[{"name":"Andrew J.

A principle challenge is to minimize the impacts of surrounding land use on park condition and biodiversity. In the absence of ideal sets of data and models, the present study develops methods and results that demonstrate a coarse-filter approach to understanding the effects of land use change on habitat types for four pilot study-areas. The area of analysis for each park is defined by a protected-area-centered-ecosystem. Habitat types were defined by biophysical factors assumed to represent the distribution of vegetation communities as they may have existed prior to European settlement. Present-day land use was overlaid on historical habitat and change in area and pattern was quantified for private and public lands separately. Results suggest that patterns of development are affecting study-areas differently. Therefore, the conservation challenges faced by each study-area are distinct to their landscape contexts. For some parks, the primary challenge is to work towards maintaining ecosystem condition in its present or near-present state while paying particular attention to habitats that are underrepresented on public lands. For other parks, the challenge is to address spatially aggregated land use that is affecting only a few habitat types. For still other parks, the challenge is to maintain connectivity with a regional network of protected lands and to undertake restoration projects where feasible. The present methods and results help to focus conservation attention on habitats that have been most impacted by land use change.","parentId":"504a0aa8e4b02b6b9f7bd9a1","contacts":[{"name":"Hansen, Andrew J.","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Montana State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Nathan Piekielek","oldPartyId":63857,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"npiekielek@gmail.com","active":true,"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Piekielek","organization":{"displayText":"Montana State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"North Central CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006320712002388","title":"Piekielek & Hansen 2012","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"U.S. National Parks"},{"scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Fragmentation"},{"scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Land use change"},{"scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Biophysical setting"},{"scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Ecological monitoring"},{"scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Decision-support"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2012-10","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-05-30T12:06:54.550-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-22T15:37:26.066-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2012","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-05-30T12:06:54.550-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2015-04-22T15:37:26.066-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"Extent of fragmentation of coarse-scale habitats in and around U.S. National Parks","facetName":"Citation","conference":"","journal":"Biological Conservation","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Pages ","value":"13-22"},{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"DOI ","value":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.biocon.2012.05.003"}],"edition":"Volume 155","language":"","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Journal Article","tableOfContents":""}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"North Central CSC","parent_id":"4f83509de4b0e84f60868124","people":["Hansen, Andrew J.","Nathan Piekielek"],"orgs":["North Central CSC"],"children":[]},"53e3a7cae4b0567f2770ee13":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/504a01afe4b02b6b9f7bd940","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Natural Regeneration Processes in Big Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata)","relatedTitle":"Vulnerability Assessment of Ecological Systems and Species to Climate and Land Use Change within the North Central Climate Change Center and Partner Land Conservation Cooperatives","id":"53e3a7cae4b0567f2770ee13","relatedId":"504a01afe4b02b6b9f7bd940","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/53e3a7cae4b0567f2770ee13","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Vulnerability Assessment of Ecological Systems and Species to Climate and Land Use Change within the North Central Climate Change Center and Partner Land Conservation Cooperatives","relatedTitle":"Natural Regeneration Processes in Big Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata)","id":"504a01afe4b02b6b9f7bd940","relatedId":"53e3a7cae4b0567f2770ee13","annotation":null}]},"id":"53e3a7cae4b0567f2770ee13","title":"Natural Regeneration Processes in Big Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata)","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/www.srmjournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.2111\/REM-D-13-00079.1):&nbsp; Big sagebrush,&nbsp; \n<em><em>Artemisia tridentata<\/em><\/em> &nbsp;Nuttall (Asteraceae), is the dominant plant species of large portions of semiarid western North America. However, much of historical big sagebrush vegetation has been removed or modified. Thus, regeneration is recognized as an important component for land management. Limited knowledge about key regeneration processes, however, represents an obstacle to identifying successful management practices and to gaining greater insight into the consequences of increasing disturbance frequency and global change. Therefore, our objective is to synthesize knowledge about natural big sagebrush regeneration. We identified and characterized the controls of big sagebrush seed production, germination, and establishment. The largest knowledge gaps and associated research needs include quiescence and dormancy of embryos and seedlings; variation in seed production and germination percentages; wet-thermal time model of germination; responses to frost events (including freezing\/thawing of soils), CO2 &nbsp;concentration, and nutrients in combination with water availability; suitability of microsite vs. site conditions; competitive ability as well as seedling growth responses; and differences among subspecies and ecoregions. Potential impacts of climate change on big sagebrush regeneration could include that temperature increases may not have a large direct influence on regeneration due to the broad temperature optimum for regeneration, whereas indirect effects could include selection for populations with less stringent seed dormancy. Drier conditions will have direct negative effects on germination and seedling survival and could also lead to lighter seeds, which lowers germination success further. The short seed dispersal distance of big sagebrush may limit its tracking of suitable climate; whereas, the low competitive ability of big sagebrush seedlings may limit successful competition with species that track climate. An improved understanding of the ecology of big sagebrush regeneration should benefit resource management activities and increase the ability of land managers to anticipate global change impacts.","parentId":"504a0aa8e4b02b6b9f7bd9a1","contacts":[{"name":"Daniel R.

To assess species\u2019 vulnerability to climate change and target ongoing conservation investments, researchers and managers often consider the effects of projected changes in climate and land use on future habitat availability and quality and the uncertainty associated with these projections. Here, we draw on tools from hydrology and climate science to project the impact of climate change on the density of wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of the USA, a critical area for breeding waterfowl and other wetland-dependent species. We evaluate the potential for a trade-off in the value of conservation investments under current and future climatic conditions and consider the joint effects of climate and land use. We use an integrated set of hydrological and climatological projections that provide physically based measures of water balance under historical and projected future climatic conditions. In addition, we use historical projections derived from ten general circulation models (GCMs) as a baseline from which to assess climate change impacts, rather than historical climate data. This method isolates the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and ensures that modeling errors are incorporated into the baseline rather than attributed to climate change. Our work shows that, on average, densities of wetlands (here defined as wetland basins holding water) are projected to decline across the U.S. Prairie Pothole Region, but that GCMs differ in both the magnitude and the direction of projected impacts. However, we found little evidence for a shift in the locations expected to provide the highest wetland densities under current vs. projected climatic conditions. This result was robust to the inclusion of projected changes in land use under climate change. We suggest that targeting conservation towards wetland complexes containing both small and relatively large wetland basins, which is an ongoing conservation strategy, may also act to hedge against uncertainty in the effects of climate change.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5228d302e4b06291bed806b8","504a0aa8e4b02b6b9f7bd9a1"],"contacts":[{"name":"Helen Sofaer","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"hsofaer@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Susan Skagen","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"skagens@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Joseph J.

A principle challenge is to minimize the impacts of surrounding land use on park condition and biodiversity. In the absence of ideal sets of data and models, the present study develops methods and results that demonstrate a coarse-filter approach to understanding the effects of land use change on habitat types for four pilot study-areas. The area of analysis for each park is defined by a protected-area-centered-ecosystem. Habitat types were defined by biophysical factors assumed to represent the distribution of vegetation communities as they may have existed prior to European settlement. Present-day land use was overlaid on historical habitat and change in area and pattern was quantified for private and public lands separately. Results suggest that patterns of development are affecting study-areas differently. Therefore, the conservation challenges faced by each study-area are distinct to their landscape contexts. For some parks, the primary challenge is to work towards maintaining ecosystem condition in its present or near-present state while paying particular attention to habitats that are underrepresented on public lands. For other parks, the challenge is to address spatially aggregated land use that is affecting only a few habitat types. For still other parks, the challenge is to maintain connectivity with a regional network of protected lands and to undertake restoration projects where feasible. The present methods and results help to focus conservation attention on habitats that have been most impacted by land use change.\n<br \/> \n<em>Remote sensing for inventory and monitoring of the U.S. national parks - ResearchGate<\/em>.

These ecosystems are being reduced in extent and quality due to economic development, invasive species, and climate change. These pervasive modifications have generated concern about the long-term viability of sagebrush habitat and sagebrush-obligate wildlife species (notably greater sage-grouse), highlighting the need for better understanding of the future big sagebrush distribution, particularly at the species' range margins. These leading and trailing edges of potential climate-driven sagebrush distribution shifts are likely to be areas most sensitive to climate change. We used a process-based regeneration model for big sagebrush, which simulates potential germination and seedling survival in response to climatic and edaphic conditions and tested expectations about current and future regeneration responses at trailing and leading edges that were previously identified using traditional species distribution models. Our results confirmed expectations of increased probability of regeneration at the leading edge and decreased probability of regeneration at the trailing edge below current levels. Our simulations indicated that soil water dynamics at the leading edge became more similar to the typical seasonal ecohydrological conditions observed within the current range of big sagebrush ecosystems. At the trailing edge, an increased winter and spring dryness represented a departure from conditions typically supportive of big sagebrush. Our results highlighted that minimum and maximum daily temperatures as well as soil water recharge and summer dry periods are important constraints for big sagebrush regeneration. Overall, our results confirmed previous predictions, i.e., we see consistent changes in areas identified as trailing and leading edges; however, we also identified potential local refugia within the trailing edge, mostly at sites at higher elevation. Decreasing regeneration probability at the trailing edge underscores the Schlaepfer et al. Future regeneration potential of big sagebrush potential futility of efforts to preserve and\/or restore big sagebrush in these areas. Conversely, increasing regeneration probability at the leading edge suggest a growing potential for conflicts in management goals between maintaining existing grasslands by preventing sagebrush expansion versus accepting a shift in plant community composition to sagebrush dominance.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["504a0aa8e4b02b6b9f7bd9a1"],"contacts":[{"name":"Daniel R.

Abundance of a species will likely provide an earlier warning indicator of change than will occupancy, yet relationships between abundance and climatic factors have received less attention. We tested whether predictors of counts of American pikas ( \n<em>Ochotona princeps<\/em> ) during surveys from the Great Basin region in 1994 - 1999 and 2003 - 2008 differed between the two periods. Additionally, we tested whether various modeled aspects of ecohydrology better predicted relative density than did average annual precipitation, and whether risk of site-wide extirpation predicted subsequent population counts of pikas. We observed several patterns of change in pika abundance at range edges that likely constitute early warnings of distributional shifts. Predictors of pika abundance differed strongly between the survey periods, as did pika extirpation patterns previously reported from this region. Additionally, maximum snowpack and growing-season precipitation resulted in better-supported models than those using average annual precipitation, and constituted two of the top three predictors of pika density in the 2000s surveys (affecting pikas perhaps via vegetation). Unexpectedly, we found that extirpation risk positively predicted subsequent population size. Our results emphasize the need to clarify mechanisms underlying biotic responses to recent climate change at organism-relevant scales, to inform management and conservation strategies for species of concern.","parentId":"504a0aa8e4b02b6b9f7bd9a1","contacts":[{"name":"Erik A Beever","oldPartyId":660,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"ebeever@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Erik","middleName":"A","lastName":"Beever","organization":{"displayText":"Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"4069946556","streetAddress":{"zip":"59715","country":"US","city":"Bozeman","state":"MT","line1":"2327 University Way, Suite 2"},"buildingCode":"KKO","name":"Erik Beever\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

This dilemma may be pronounced at range peripheries where rates of change are accelerated and ongoing invasions often are perceived as threats to local ecosystems. We provide an example from City of Rocks National Reserve (CIRO) in southern Idaho, positioned at the northern range periphery of pinyon-juniper (P-J) woodland. Reserve managers are concerned about P-J woodland encroachment into adjacent sagebrush steppe, but the rates and biophysical variability of encroachment are not well documented and management options are not well understood. We quantified the rate and extent of woodland change between 1950 and 2009 based on a random sample of aerial photo interpretation plots distributed across biophysical gradients. Our study revealed that woodland cover remained at approximately 20% of the study area over the 59-year period. In the absence of disturbance, P-J woodlands exhibited the highest rate of increase among vegetation types at 0.37% yr - 1. Overall, late-successional P-J stands increased in area by over 100% through the process of densification (infilling). However, wildfires during the period resulted in a net decrease of woody evergreen vegetation, particularly among early and mid-successional P-J stands. Elevated wildfire risk associated with expanding novel annual grasslands and drought is likely to continue to be a fundamental driver of change in CIRO woodlands. Because P-J woodlands contribute to regional biodiversity and may contract at trailing edges with global warming, CIRO may become important to P-J woodland conservation in the future. Our study provides a widely applicable toolset for assessing woodland ecotone dynamics that can help managers reconcile the competing demands to maintain historical fidelity and contribute meaningfully to the U.S. protected area network in a future with novel, no-analog ecosystems.","parentId":"504a0aa8e4b02b6b9f7bd9a1","contacts":[{"name":"Scott L.

The overall goals of the BLM Rapid Ecoregional Assessments (REAs) are to identify important ecosystems and wildlife habitats at broad spatial scales; identify where these resources are at risk from Change Agents, including development, wildfire, invasive species, disease and climate change; quantify cumulative effects of anthropogenic stressors; and assess current levels of risk to ecological resources across a range of spatial scales and jurisdictional boundaries by assessing all lands within an ecoregion. There are several components of the REAs. Management Questions, developed by the BLM and stakeholders for the ecoregion, identify the regionally significant information needed for addressing land-management responsibilities. Conservation Elements represent regionally significant species and ecological communities that are of management concern. Change Agents that currently affect or are likely to affect the condition of species and communities in the future are identified and assessed. REAs also identify areas that have high conservation potential that are referred to as \u201clarge intact areas.\u201d At the ecoregion level, the ecological value of large intact areas is based on the assumption that because these areas have not been greatly altered by human activities (such as development), they are more likely to contain a variety of plant and animal communities and to be resilient and resistant to changes resulting from natural disturbances such as fire, insect outbreaks, and disease.<\/p>\n<p>The Wyoming Basin Ecoregion encompasses approximately 133,656 square kilometers (51,604.87 square miles), including portions of Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and Montana. The Wyoming Basin has some of the highest quality wildlife habitats remaining in the Intermountain West. The wide variety of habitats includes intermountain basins dominated by sagebrush shrublands interspersed with deciduous and conifer woodlands and montane or subalpine forests at higher elevations. The Wyoming Basin also supports ranching and agricultural operations that are important to the region\u2019s economy and vital to conserving habitats for wildlife. The region also contains abundant energy resources, including large natural gas reserves and areas of high wind-energy potential. Combined with increased residential and industrial development, fast-paced energy development is resulting in notable land-use changes, including habitat loss and fragmentation.<\/p>\n<p>In the Wyoming Basin REA, we evaluated the following seven communities as Conservation Elements: streams and rivers, wetlands, riparian forests and shrublands, sagebrush steppe, desert shrublands, foothill shrublands and woodlands, and mountain forests and alpine zones. We evaluated a total of 14 species and species assemblages as Conservation Elements: aspen forests and woodlands, five-needle pine forests and woodlands, juniper woodlands, cutthroat trout, three-species fish assemblage, northern leatherside chub, sauger, spadefoot assemblage, greater sage-grouse, golden eagle, ferruginous hawk, sagebrush-obligate birds, pygmy rabbit, and mule deer.<\/p>\n<p>We evaluated Management Questions (Core and Integrated) for each species and community for the Wyoming Basin REA. Core Management Questions address primary management issues, including (1) where is the Conservation Element, and what are its key ecological attributes (characteristics of species and communities that may affect their long-term persistence or viability); (2) what and where are the Change Agents; and (3) how do the Change Agents affect the key ecological attributes? Integrated Management Questions synthesize the Core Management Questions as follows: (1) where are the areas with high landscape-level ecological values; (2) where are the areas with high landscape-level risks; and (3) where are the potential areas for conservation, restoration, and development? The associated maps and key findings for each Management Question are summarized for each Conservation Element in individual chapters. Additional chapters on landscape intactness and an REA synthesis are included.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["504a0b63e4b02b6b9f7bd9bb"],"contacts":[{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey","type":"Publisher"}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.er.usgs.gov\/publication\/ofr20151155","rel":"related","title":"Publications Warehouse Index Page","hidden":false},{"type":"pdf","uri":"https:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/of\/2015\/1155\/pdf\/front.pdf","rel":"related","title":"Front Matter","hidden":false},{"type":"browseImage","uri":"https:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/of\/2015\/1155\/coverthb1.jpg","rel":"related","title":"Thumbnail","hidden":false}],"browseCategories":["Publication"],"browseTypes":["Citation"],"tags":[{"type":"Publication","scheme":"USGS Publications Warehouse","name":"Open-File Report"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2015","label":"Publication Date"},"1":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-09-30T04:19:14.582-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"2":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-26T09:11:24.157-06:00","label":"Last Updated"},"pub":"2015","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-09-30T04:19:14.582-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-10-26T09:11:24.157-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"note":"","facetName":"Citation","journal":"Open-File Report","parts":[{"_class":"CitationPart","type":"Publication Place","value":"Reston, VA"}],"language":"English","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.CitationFacet","citationType":"Report","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li>Editors and Contributing Authors<\/li>\n<li>Executive Summary<\/li>\n<li>Acknowledgments<\/li>\n<li>Acronyms Used in this Report<\/li>\n<li>Scientific Names of Species Used in This Report<\/li>\n<li>Conversion Factors<\/li>\n<li>Scientific Notation Used in This Report<\/li>\n<li>How to Use the Wyoming Basin Rapid Ecoregional Assessment<\/li>\n<li>Section I.

Climate scientists expect the region to experience more summer heat waves, longer-lasting and more frequent droughts, and decreased river flow in the future. These changes will ultimately impact local communities and challenge natural resource managers in allocating water under unpredictable drought conditions, preserving forests in the face of changing fire regimes, and managing threatened species under shifting ecological conditions.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nIn light of the wide-ranging potential impacts of climate change in the region, this project seeks to help decision-makers develop strategies to reduce climate change impacts on people and nature. Scientists, land managers, and local communities will work together to identify actions that can be taken to reduce the negative impacts of climate change. Known as \u201cadaptation strategies\u201d, these actions are an essential component of effective planning under shifting climate conditions. To facilitate the planning process, researchers will provide information on the vulnerability of ecosystems, model plausible future climate conditions, and identify the social contexts in which adaptation decisions are made.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThe project will focus on the San Juan and upper Gunnison river basins of southwestern Colorado, though the goal is to develop an adaptation toolkit that can be applied to other landscapes. By identifying appropriate adaptation actions, this project will help improve the resilience of local communities and ecosystems in the face of an uncertain future.<br>\n&nbsp;<\/div>\n","purpose":"In southwestern Colorado, climate change includes higher temperatures, more frequent and prolonged drought, accelerated snowmelt, larger and more intense fires, more extreme storms, and the spread of invasive species. These changes put livelihoods, ecosystems, and species at risk. To help communities cope, this project will create opportunities for scientists, land managers, and affected residents to learn from each other and identify actions that each can take individually or collectively to reduce the negative impacts of climate change in the San Juan and Gunnison Basins. This project will develop and pilot an integrated adaptation planning framework that will generate practical strategies and scientific knowledge to advance climate change adaptation in the study sites. These adaptation strategies and the process whereby they were created will be documented by the participating scientists to assist communities elsewhere to identify goals and actions that conserve key species, ecosystems, and resources, and address the needs of local communities and natural resource managers in the face of a changing

North-Central U.S.: Tribal Engagement, Climate Training, and PhenoCam Deployment","body":"<div>\n<p>Climate change is poised to alter natural systems, the frequency of extreme weather, and human health and livelihoods. In order to effectively prepare for and respond to these challenges in the north-central region of the U.S., people must have the knowledge and tools to develop plans and adaptation strategies. The objective of this project was to build stakeholders\u2019 capacity to respond to climate change in the north-central U.S., filling in gaps not covered by other projects in the region. During the course of this project, researchers focused on three major activities:<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<strong>Tribal Capacity Building:<\/strong> Researchers provided tribal colleges and universities with mini-grants to develop student projects to document climate-related changes in weather and culturally or traditionally significant plants. These efforts, carried out in collaboration with other organizations, contributed to building the Indigenous Geography Phenology Network, a locally grounded, national network for documenting the impacts of climate change on plants and animals. Researchers also helped the Intertribal Council On Utility Policy determine how climate science could be integrated into management decisions in the resource-rich Missouri River Basin.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<strong>Climate Training for Resource Managers:<\/strong> Researchers offered two climate change vulnerability assessment courses \u2013 one in Jackson, Wyoming and another in La Crosse, Wisconsin \u2013 designed to build the knowledge and skills of resource managers. Additional trainings on climate-smart conservation are being planned.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<strong>PhenoCam Deployment:<\/strong> Researchers co-supported the deployment of PhenoCams (streaming cameras) in locations throughout Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Observations collected by the PhenoCams will help scientists track seasonal changes across the region and better understand how climate impacts living things.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","purpose":"In addition to the major projects funded by the North Central Climate Science Center (NC CSC), selected through its solicitation process or the directed funds going to the foundational Science Areas, there remains a need within the north central domain to support work that builds capacity among stakeholders that have been otherwise left out of the major projects funded by the NC CSC. During the course of this project, we focused on stakeholder capacity building by providing regional offerings of climate-related courses for resource managers, supporting tribal college students and deploying technology to better understand how climate impacts living things, and supporting strategic scientific study of the climate\/energy\/environment nexus in the Missouri River Basin. First, the NC CSC provided climate education opportunities in collaboration with the US Fish and Wildlife Service National Conservation Training Center (NCTC).

Generally, hydrologic models are created as needed for specific watersheds or regions, with different model structures, calibration methods, and data sources used for different locations. This piece-meal approach limits the utility of existing hydrological models for reliable comparisons among different watersheds or regions and for larger-scale regional or national projections and decision-making. The USGS Modeling of Watershed Systems (MoWS) group is currently developing the infrastructure for a National Hydrologic Model (NHM) to support coordinated, comprehensive, and consistent hydrologic model development and application using the USGS Monthly Water Balance model (MWB) and Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS). The NHM will provide internally consistent estimates of total water availability, water sources, and streamflow timing, and measures of uncertainty around these estimates, for the entire United States. \r\nDeveloping the NHM requires use of consistent methods for data selection, watershed measurements, model calibration, and model projections by separate research hydrologists across the nation. Further, it requires an organizational system for records of data sources and methods, to allow for transparent comparisons of the provenance of model calibrations and projections for different regions within the NHM. VisTrails, which is a scientific workflow and provenance management system (www.vistrails.org), could be used to facilitate consistent, organized, reproducible data management, analysis, and visualization for the NHM. A VisTrails system for MWB and\/or PRMS would be widely used in the NHM effort as well as by numerous agencies and researchers for individual hydrologic model applications.\r\nWe propose to work with NC CSC staff to develop a VisTrails system for MWB, as a first step in developing a more complex VisTrails system for PRMS. MWB calculates the amount of water within different parts of a watershed using an accounting procedure, and takes into account climatic water supply and demand, seasonal variation in climatic water supply and demand, snow accumulation and melt, and soil-moisture storage. The proposed VisTrails system for MWB will include the MWB structure, methods for importing and adjusting climate and landscape data inputs, methods for dividing watersheds into smaller sections or \u201chydrologic response units\u201d, analytical tools for calibrating and evaluating the model, and mechanisms for visualizing model projections. It will be designed to facilitate both model calibration and model simulations with different climate change projections. Access to frequently-used online data sources will be built into the system. The resulting VisTrails system for MWB will facilitate consistent, organized, and reproducible model calibration and simulations for monthly streamflow projections by research hydrologists and managers

based on climate science and ecological forecasting. Project objectives are to: 1. Forecast ecosystem processes and WBP habitat suitability across the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) under alternative IPCC future scenarios; 2. Improve understanding of possible response to future climate by analyzing WBP\/climate relationships in past millennia; 3. Develop WBP management alternatives; 4. Evaluate the alternatives under IPCC future scenarios in terms of WBP goals, ecosystem services, and costs of implementation; and 5. Draw recommendations for implementation of the GYCC WBP strategy that consider uncertainty. Recommendations will be derived in a scenario planning workshop based on both the results and uncertainty in the results. These recommendations can thus be immediately acted upon by the GYA management community and the approach and methods will be readily applicable to the several other tree species that are undergoing die-offs under changing climate.&nbsp;<\/div>\n","parentId":"52604264e4b04eaeeb44eda5","contacts":[{"name":"Todd Kipfer","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"tkipfer@montana.edu","organization":{"displayText":"Montana State University"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"(406) 994-7977","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"59717","country":"USA","city":"Bozeman","state":"MT","line1":"Institute on Ecosystems\r\nPO Box 173490\r\n106 AJM Johnson Hall"}}},{"name":"Andrew Hansen","type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"hansen@montana.edu","organization":{"displayText":"Montana State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Karl Buermeyer","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Bridger-Teton National Forest"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Kristen Legg","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"National Park Service Inventory & Monitoring"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Dan Reinhart","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Yellowstone National Park"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Virginia Kelly","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Gregory T Pederson","oldPartyId":13319,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"gpederson@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Gregory","middleName":"T","lastName":"Pederson","organization":{"displayText":"Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"4069946556","officePhone":"4069947390","streetAddress":{"zip":"59715","country":"US","city":"Bozeman","state":"MT","line1":"2327 University Way, Suite 2"},"buildingCode":"KKO","name":"Gregory T Pederson\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

Pioneering Approaches to Science and Management","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/www.islandpress.org\/book\/climate-change-in-wildlands):&nbsp;Scientists have been warning for years that human activity is heating up the planet and climate change is under way. In the past century, global temperatures have risen an average of 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit, a trend that is expected to only accelerate. But public sentiment has taken a long time to catch up, and we are only just beginning to acknowledge the serious effects this will have on all life on Earth. The federal government is crafting broad-scale strategies to protect wildland ecosystems from the worst effects of climate change. The challenge now is to get the latest science into the hands of resource managers entrusted with protecting water, plants, fish and wildlife, tribal lands, and cultural heritage sites in wildlands.\n<br> \n<br> Teaming with NASA and the Department of the Interior, ecologist Andrew Hansen, along with his team of scientists and managers, set out to understand how climate and land use changes affect montane landscapes of the Rockies and the Appalachians, and how these findings can be applied to wildlands elsewhere. They examine changes over the past century as well as expected future change, assess the vulnerability of species and ecosystems to these changes, and provide new, collaborative management approaches to mitigate expected impacts. A series of case studies showcases how managers might tackle such wide-ranging problems as the effects of warming streams on cold-water fish in Great Smoky Mountain National Park and dying white-bark pine stands in the Greater Yellowstone area. A surprising finding is that species and ecosystems vary dramatically in vulnerability to climate change.

However, integrating the additional impacts of climate change into STSMs remains a challenge. We address this challenge by combining an STSM with species distribution modeling (SDM). SDMs estimate the probability of occurrence of a given species based on observed presence and absence locations as well as environmental and climatic covariates. Thus, in order to account for changes in habitat suitability due to climate change, we used SDM to generate continuous surfaces of species occurrence probabilities. These data were imported into ST-Sim, an STSM platform, where they dictated the probability of each cell transitioning between alternate potential vegetation types at each time step. The STSM was parameterized to capture additional processes of vegetation growth and disturbance that are relevant to a keystone species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem\u2014whitebark pine (\n<em>Pinus albicaulis<\/em>). We compared historical model runs against historical observations of whitebark pine and a key disturbance agent (mountain pine beetle,&nbsp;\n<em>Dendroctonus ponderosae<\/em>), and then projected the simulation into the future. Using this combination of correlative and stochastic simulation models, we were able to reproduce historical observations and identify key data gaps. Results indicated that SDMs and STSMs are complementary tools, and combining them is an effective way to account for the anticipated impacts of climate change, biotic interactions, and disturbances, while also allowing for the exploration of management options.","parentId":"545a8957e4b009f8aec980a0","linkParentIds":["5228d36ce4b06291bed806c6"],"contacts":[{"name":"Brian

Environmental Variability Increases Understanding of Future Vulnerability","body":"Ecological niche models predict plant responses to climate change by circumscribing species distributions within a multivariate environmental framework. Most projections based on modern bioclimatic correlations imply that high-elevation species are likely to be extirpated from their current ranges as a result of rising growing-season temperatures in the coming decades. Paleoecological data spanning the last 15,000 years from the Greater Yellowstone region describe the response of vegetation to past climate variability and suggest that white pines, a taxon of special concern in the region, have been surprisingly resilient to high summer temperature and fire activity in the past. Moreover, the fossil record suggests that winter conditions and biotic interactions have been critical limiting variables for high-elevation conifers in the past and will likely be so in the future. This long-term perspective offers insights on species responses to a broader range of climate and associated ecosystem changes than can be observed at present and should be part of resource management and conservation planning for the future.","parentId":"5228d36ce4b06291bed806c6","contacts":[{"name":"Virginia Iglesias","type":"Author","contactType":"person","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Teresa R.

For the sub-alpine species whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), warming temperatures may indirectly result in loss of suitable bioclimatic habitat, reducing its distribution within its historic range. This research focuses on understanding the patterns of spatiotemporal variability for future projected P.albicaulis suitable habitat in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) through a bioclimatic envelope approach. Since intermodel variability from General Circulation Models (GCMs) lead to differing predictions regarding the magnitude and direction of modeled suitable habitat area, nine bias-corrected statistically down-scaled GCMs were utilized to understand the uncertainty associated with modeled projections. P.albicaulis was modeled using a Random Forests algorithm for the 1980-2010 climate period and showed strong presence\/absence separations by summer maximum temperatures and springtime snowpack. Patterns of projected habitat change by the end of the century suggested a constant decrease in suitable climate area from the 2010 baseline for both Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 8.5 and 4.5 climate forcing scenarios. Percent suitable climate area estimates ranged from 2-29% and 0.04-10% by 2099 for RCP 8.5 and 4.5 respectively. Habitat projections between GCMs displayed a decrease of variability over the 2010-2099 time period related to consistent warming above the 1910-2010 temperature normal after 2070 for all GCMs. A decreasing pattern of projected P.albicaulis suitable habitat area change was consistent across GCMs, despite strong differences in magnitude. Future ecological research in species distribution modeling should consider a full suite of GCM projections in the analysis to reduce extreme range contractions\/expansions predictions. The results suggest that restoration strageties such as planting of seedlings and controlling competing vegetation may be necessary to maintain P.albicaulis in the GYA under the more extreme future climate scenarios.\n<br \/> \n<br \/> \n<strong>This publication was developed as part of the project,&nbsp; <a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/display-project\/4f83509de4b0e84f60868124\/521ce546e4b01458f7857fd6\">Informing Implementation of the Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee\u2019s (GYCC) Whitebark Pine (WBP) Strategy Based on Climate Sciences, Ecological Forecasting, and Valuation of WBP-Related Ecosystem Services<\/a>.<\/strong>","parentId":"5228d36ce4b06291bed806c6","contacts":[{"name":"Tony Chang","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Montana State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Andrew J.

Species distribution models have become a widely used tool to generate first-pass estimates of climate change impacts to species probabilities of occurrence. There are a number of technical challenges to constructing species distribution models that can be alleviated by the use of scientific workflow software. These challenges include data integration, visualization of modeled predictor\u2013response relationships, and ensuring that models are reproducible and transferable in an adaptive natural resource management framework. We used freely available software called VisTrails Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (\n<em>VisTrails:SAHM<\/em>) along with a novel ecohydrological predictor dataset and the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 future climate projections to construct species distribution models for eight forest and shrub species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in the Northern Rocky Mountains USA. The species considered included multiple species of sagebrush and juniper,&nbsp;\n<em>Pinus flexilis<\/em>,&nbsp;\n<em>Pinus contorta<\/em>,&nbsp;\n<em>Pseudotsuga menziesii<\/em>,&nbsp;\n<em>Populus tremuloides<\/em>,&nbsp;\n<em>Abies lasciocarpa<\/em>,\n<em>Picea engelmannii<\/em>, and&nbsp;\n<em>Pinus albicaulis<\/em>. Current and future species probabilities of occurrence were mapped in a GIS by land ownership category to assess the feasibility of undertaking present and future management action. Results suggested that decreasing spring snowpack and increasing late-season soil moisture deficit will lead to deteriorating habitat area for mountain forest species and expansion of habitat area for sagebrush and juniper communities. Results were consistent across nine global climate models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios. For most forest species their projected future distributions moved up in elevation from general federal to federally restricted lands where active management is currently prohibited by agency policy. Though not yet fully mature, custom scientific workflow software shows considerable promise to ease many of the technical challenges inherent in modeling the potential ecological impacts of climate change to support climate adaptation planning.","parentId":"545a8957e4b009f8aec980a0","linkParentIds":["5228d36ce4b06291bed806c6"],"contacts":[{"name":"Nathan

Wetland-Dependent Birds in the Prairie Pothole Region: Selection, Evaluation, and Management Application in the Face of Climate Change","body":"<div>The Prairie Pothole Region spans parts of North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Montana, Iowa and south-central Canada and contains millions of wetlands that provide habitat for breeding and migrating birds. Because it is the continent\u2019s most important breeding area for waterfowl, conservation and management largely focuses on protecting habitat for nesting ducks. However, other wetland-dependent birds also rely on this region, and it is important to understand the degree to which habitat conserved for ducks provides habitat for other species, and how the quality of this habitat will be affected by climate change. Project researchers will test whether waterfowl are effective representatives, or surrogates, for other wetland-dependent birds by predicting how climate change will affect habitat suitability for waterfowl and other species. The team will also consider how climate change is likely to affect land-use patterns and agricultural conversion risk, and use these predictions to identify areas of the landscape where both waterfowl and other species are expected to have suitable habitat in the future. This research will help managers efficiently direct their resources towards conserving areas that will provide habitat to a broad suite of species.<\/div>\n","parentId":"52604264e4b04eaeeb44eda5","contacts":[{"name":"Susan K Skagen","oldPartyId":9529,"type":"Principal

The North American Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) hosts nearly 120 species of wetland-dependent birds representing 21 families. Strategic management requires knowledge of avian habitat requirements and assessment of species most vulnerable to future threats. We applied bioclimatic species distribution models (SDMs) to project range changes of 29 wetland-dependent bird species using ensemble modeling techniques, a large number of General Circulation Models (GCMs), and hydrological climate covariates. For the U.S. PPR, mean projected range change, expressed as a proportion of currently occupied range, was \u22120.31 (\u00b1 0.22 SD; range&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;0.75 to 0.16), and all but two species were projected to lose habitat. Species associated with deeper water were expected to experience smaller negative impacts of climate change. The magnitude of climate change impacts was somewhat lower in this study than earlier efforts most likely due to use of different focal species, varying methodologies, different modeling decisions, or alternative GCMs. Quantification of the projected species-specific impacts of climate change using species distribution modeling offers valuable information for vulnerability assessments within the conservation planning process.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5228d302e4b06291bed806b8"],"contacts":[{"name":"Valerie Steen","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"vsteen@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Susan Skagen","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"skagens@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Cynthia P.

To assess species\u2019 vulnerability to climate change and target ongoing conservation investments, researchers and managers often consider the effects of projected changes in climate and land use on future habitat availability and quality and the uncertainty associated with these projections. Here, we draw on tools from hydrology and climate science to project the impact of climate change on the density of wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of the USA, a critical area for breeding waterfowl and other wetland-dependent species. We evaluate the potential for a trade-off in the value of conservation investments under current and future climatic conditions and consider the joint effects of climate and land use. We use an integrated set of hydrological and climatological projections that provide physically based measures of water balance under historical and projected future climatic conditions. In addition, we use historical projections derived from ten general circulation models (GCMs) as a baseline from which to assess climate change impacts, rather than historical climate data. This method isolates the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and ensures that modeling errors are incorporated into the baseline rather than attributed to climate change. Our work shows that, on average, densities of wetlands (here defined as wetland basins holding water) are projected to decline across the U.S. Prairie Pothole Region, but that GCMs differ in both the magnitude and the direction of projected impacts. However, we found little evidence for a shift in the locations expected to provide the highest wetland densities under current vs. projected climatic conditions. This result was robust to the inclusion of projected changes in land use under climate change. We suggest that targeting conservation towards wetland complexes containing both small and relatively large wetland basins, which is an ongoing conservation strategy, may also act to hedge against uncertainty in the effects of climate change.<\/span><\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5228d302e4b06291bed806b8","504a0aa8e4b02b6b9f7bd9a1"],"contacts":[{"name":"Helen Sofaer","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"hsofaer@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Susan Skagen","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"skagens@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Joseph J.

Due to their small size and the relatively dry climate of the region, these wetlands are considered at high risk for negative climate change effects as temperatures increase. To estimate the potential impacts of climate change on breeding waterbirds, we predicted current and future distributions of species common in the PPR using species distribution models (SDMs). We created regional-scale SDMs for the U.S. PPR using Breeding Bird Survey occurrence records for 1971\u20132011 and wetland, upland, and climate variables. For each species, we predicted current distribution based on climate records for 1981\u20132000 and projected future distributions to climate scenarios for 2040\u20132049. Species were projected to, on average, lose almost half their current habitat (-46%). However, individual species projections varied widely, from +8% (Upland Sandpiper) to -100% (Wilson's Snipe). Variable importance ranks indicated that land cover (wetland and upland) variables were generally more important than climate variables in predicting species distributions. However, climate variables were relatively more important during a drought period. Projected distributions of species responses to climate change contracted within current areas of distribution rather than shifting. Given the large variation in species-level impacts, we suggest that climate change mitigation efforts focus on species projected to be the most vulnerable by enacting targeted wetland management, easement acquisition, and restoration efforts.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["5228d302e4b06291bed806b8"],"contacts":[{"name":"Valerie Steen","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"vsteen@usgs.gov"},{"name":"Susan K.

Pioneering Approaches to Science and Management","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/www.islandpress.org\/book\/climate-change-in-wildlands):&nbsp;Scientists have been warning for years that human activity is heating up the planet and climate change is under way. In the past century, global temperatures have risen an average of 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit, a trend that is expected to only accelerate. But public sentiment has taken a long time to catch up, and we are only just beginning to acknowledge the serious effects this will have on all life on Earth. The federal government is crafting broad-scale strategies to protect wildland ecosystems from the worst effects of climate change. The challenge now is to get the latest science into the hands of resource managers entrusted with protecting water, plants, fish and wildlife, tribal lands, and cultural heritage sites in wildlands.\n<br> \n<br> Teaming with NASA and the Department of the Interior, ecologist Andrew Hansen, along with his team of scientists and managers, set out to understand how climate and land use changes affect montane landscapes of the Rockies and the Appalachians, and how these findings can be applied to wildlands elsewhere. They examine changes over the past century as well as expected future change, assess the vulnerability of species and ecosystems to these changes, and provide new, collaborative management approaches to mitigate expected impacts. A series of case studies showcases how managers might tackle such wide-ranging problems as the effects of warming streams on cold-water fish in Great Smoky Mountain National Park and dying white-bark pine stands in the Greater Yellowstone area. A surprising finding is that species and ecosystems vary dramatically in vulnerability to climate change. While many will suffer severe effects, others may actually benefit from projected changes.\n<br> \n<br> \n<em>Climate Change in Wildlands<\/em>&nbsp;is a collaboration between scientists and managers, providing a science-derived framework and common-sense approaches for keeping parks and protected areas healthy on a rapidly changing planet. -

However, integrating the additional impacts of climate change into STSMs remains a challenge. We address this challenge by combining an STSM with species distribution modeling (SDM). SDMs estimate the probability of occurrence of a given species based on observed presence and absence locations as well as environmental and climatic covariates. Thus, in order to account for changes in habitat suitability due to climate change, we used SDM to generate continuous surfaces of species occurrence probabilities. These data were imported into ST-Sim, an STSM platform, where they dictated the probability of each cell transitioning between alternate potential vegetation types at each time step. The STSM was parameterized to capture additional processes of vegetation growth and disturbance that are relevant to a keystone species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem\u2014whitebark pine (\n<em>Pinus albicaulis<\/em>). We compared historical model runs against historical observations of whitebark pine and a key disturbance agent (mountain pine beetle,&nbsp;\n<em>Dendroctonus ponderosae<\/em>), and then projected the simulation into the future. Using this combination of correlative and stochastic simulation models, we were able to reproduce historical observations and identify key data gaps. Results indicated that SDMs and STSMs are complementary tools, and combining them is an effective way to account for the anticipated impacts of climate change, biotic interactions, and disturbances, while also allowing for the exploration of management options.","parentId":"545a8957e4b009f8aec980a0","linkParentIds":["5228d36ce4b06291bed806c6"],"contacts":[{"name":"Brian Miller","oldPartyId":64649,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"Brian.Miller@colostate.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Miller","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Leonardo Frid","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Apex Resource Management Solutions Ltd."},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Tony Chang","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Montana State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Nathan Piekielek","oldPartyId":63857,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"npiekielek@gmail.com","active":true,"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Piekielek","organization":{"displayText":"The Pennsylvania State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Andrew Hansen","oldPartyId":59470,"contactType":"person","email":"hansen@montana.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Andy","lastName":"Hansen","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"Andy Hansen\/MONTANA.EDU -

Species distribution models have become a widely used tool to generate first-pass estimates of climate change impacts to species probabilities of occurrence. There are a number of technical challenges to constructing species distribution models that can be alleviated by the use of scientific workflow software. These challenges include data integration, visualization of modeled predictor\u2013response relationships, and ensuring that models are reproducible and transferable in an adaptive natural resource management framework. We used freely available software called VisTrails Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (\n<em>VisTrails:SAHM<\/em>) along with a novel ecohydrological predictor dataset and the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 future climate projections to construct species distribution models for eight forest and shrub species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in the Northern Rocky Mountains USA. The species considered included multiple species of sagebrush and juniper,&nbsp;\n<em>Pinus flexilis<\/em>,&nbsp;\n<em>Pinus contorta<\/em>,&nbsp;\n<em>Pseudotsuga menziesii<\/em>,&nbsp;\n<em>Populus tremuloides<\/em>,&nbsp;\n<em>Abies lasciocarpa<\/em>,\n<em>Picea engelmannii<\/em>, and&nbsp;\n<em>Pinus albicaulis<\/em>. Current and future species probabilities of occurrence were mapped in a GIS by land ownership category to assess the feasibility of undertaking present and future management action. Results suggested that decreasing spring snowpack and increasing late-season soil moisture deficit will lead to deteriorating habitat area for mountain forest species and expansion of habitat area for sagebrush and juniper communities. Results were consistent across nine global climate models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios. For most forest species their projected future distributions moved up in elevation from general federal to federally restricted lands where active management is currently prohibited by agency policy. Though not yet fully mature, custom scientific workflow software shows considerable promise to ease many of the technical challenges inherent in modeling the potential ecological impacts of climate change to support climate adaptation planning.","parentId":"545a8957e4b009f8aec980a0","linkParentIds":["5228d36ce4b06291bed806c6"],"contacts":[{"name":"Nathan

Researchers will evaluate and improve available and emerging data on climate conditions that influence drought (such as changes in temperature, precipitation, evaporative demand, snow and soil moisture), as well as datasets related to the surface water balance (such as evapotranspiration and streamflow). Researchers will then use these data to identify a range of plausible future climate conditions for the region, known as \u201cscenarios\u201d, to help land managers better understand the threat posed by drought and to plan for its potential impacts.

Particular focus will be paid to improving the datasets and methods regarding evapotranspiration, and in particular the proper physically-based calculation of potential evapotranspiration (PET).  This will include developing a better understanding of the drivers of long-term change in evaporative demand.  \r\n\r\nThe main integrative focus of all three Foundational Areas will be on the role drought in the region, both as a present-day stressor, but also a way in which climate change will likely be manifested.  The work will include a) evaluation climate conditions in different regions of the North Central domain which would lead to drought conditions (e.g., extended heat conditions, extended periods of low precipitation, or a combination of both) and the large-scale climate drivers of these local conditions, b)  evaluation of climate products that are related to the surface water balance and drought (for example, evapotranspiration and streamflow projections), and  c) synthesis of existing information on drivers of drought in the North Central domain for use in adaptation.  \r\n\r\nThrough close work with the Impacts Team (Hansen), we will provide guidance and evaluation of climate products for ecological modeling, particularly for the forests and grasslands modeling efforts. Through close work with the Adaptation and Vulnerability Team (Ojima\/McNeeley) we will develop and provide narrative drought scenarios of relevance for the various DRAI study areas.   This includes work on evaluation and integration of existing and novel data products into the ReVAMP resource.  The proposal consists of a common introduction to the objectives of the three Foundational Science teams, a proposal body specific to the goals of the Climate team, and a common section describing the collaboration strategies that will integrate the activities of the three teams.

as a Spatial Predictor of Air Temperature across the Conterminous United States","body":"Abstract (from&nbsp;http:\/\/journals.ametsoc.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1175\/JAMC-D-15-0276.1):&nbsp;Remotely sensed land skin temperature (LST) is increasingly being used to improve gridded interpolations of near-surface air temperature. The appeal of LST as a spatial predictor of air temperature rests in the fact that it is an observation available at spatial resolutions fine enough to capture topoclimatic and biophysical variations. However, it remains unclear if LST improves air temperature interpolations over what can already be obtained with simpler terrain-based predictor variables. Here, the relationship between LST and air temperature is evaluated across the conterminous United States (CONUS). It is found that there are significant differences in the ability of daytime and nighttime observations of LST to improve air temperature interpolations. Daytime LST mainly indicates finescale biophysical variation and is generally a poorer predictor of maximum air temperature than simple linear models based on elevation, longitude, and latitude. Moderate improvements to maximum air temperature interpolations are thus limited to specific mountainous areas in winter, to coastal areas, and to semiarid and arid regions where daytime LST likely captures variations in evaporative cooling and aridity. In contrast, nighttime LST represents important topoclimatic variation throughout the mountainous western CONUS and significantly improves nighttime minimum air temperature interpolations. In regions of more homogenous terrain, nighttime LST also captures biophysical patterns related to land cover. Both daytime and nighttime LST display large spatial and seasonal variability in their ability to improve air temperature interpolations beyond simpler approaches.","parentId":"54248085e4b037b608f9edf9","contacts":[{"name":"Jared W.

Analysis of the ensemble mean response of CMIP5 global climate models (GCMs) shows amplified warming in high elevation regions during the cold season in boreal midlatitudes. We examine how the twenty-first century elevation-dependent response in the daily minimum surface air temperature [d(\u0394Tmin)\/dz] varies among 27 different GCMs during winter for the RCP 8.5 emissions scenario. The focus is on regions within the northern hemisphere mid-latitude band between 27.5&deg;N and 40&deg;N, which includes both the Rocky Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau\/Himalayas. We find significant variability in d(\u0394Tmin)\/dz among the individual models ranging from 0.16 &deg;C\/km (10th percentile) to 0.97 &deg;C\/km (90th percentile), although nearly all of the GCMs (24 out of 27) show a significant positive value for d(\u0394Tmin)\/dz. To identify some of the important drivers associated with the variability in d(\u0394Tmin)\/dz during winter, we evaluate the co-variance between d(\u0394Tmin)\/dz and the differential response of elevation-based anomalies in different climate variables as well as the GCMs\u2019 spatial resolution, their global climate sensitivity, and their elevation-dependent free air temperature response. We find that d(\u0394Tmin)\/dz has the strongest correlation with elevation-dependent increases in surface water vapor, followed by elevation-dependent decreases in surface albedo, and a weak positive correlation with the GCMs\u2019 free air temperature response.","parentId":"54248085e4b037b608f9edf9","contacts":[{"name":"Imtiaz Rangwala","oldPartyId":63231,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"imtiaz.rangwala@colorado.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Imtiaz","lastName":"Rangwala","organization":{"displayText":"University of Colorado"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Eric Sinsky","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Connecticut"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"James R.

the North-Central U.S.: Tribal Engagement and PhenoCam Analysis","body":"<div>\n<p>Climate change is poised to alter natural systems, the frequency of extreme weather, and human health and livelihoods. In order to effectively prepare for and respond to these challenges in the north-central region of the U.S., people must have the knowledge and tools to develop plans and adaptation strategies. This project is a continuation of an <a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/display-project\/4f83509de4b0e84f60868124\/52261f5ae4b07a38b633df3d\">effort begun in 2013<\/a> to build stakeholders\u2019 capacity to respond to climate change in the north-central U.S. During the course of this project, researchers are focusing on two major activities:<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<strong>Tribal Capacity Building:<\/strong> Researchers are providing tribal colleges and universities with mini-grants to develop student projects to document climate-related changes in weather and culturally or traditionally significant plants. Data collected by students will be available for use in climate change impact assessments. The activity will contribute to the expansion of the Indigenous Geography Phenology Network, a locally grounded, national network for documenting the impacts of climate change. Additionally, researchers are collaborating with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the National Conservation Training Center to offer a climate training course in Rapid City, South Dakota, directed at tribal environmental professionals.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<strong>PhenoCam Analysis:<\/strong> Researchers are providing ongoing technical support to maintain and begin to analyze the data from PhenoCams (streaming cameras) located across the north-central region. Observations collected by the PhenoCams will help scientists track seasonal changes across the region and better understand how climate impacts living things.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","purpose":"With this 2014 project the North Central Climate Science Center (NC CSC) will continue its capacity building efforts among stakeholders through two primary initiatives: \n\n1) Expanding the Indigenous Geography Phenology Network (IGPN). This project will support tribal college and university (TCU) mini-grants to develop student phenological and meteorological observation projects in support of research to document the impacts of climate change and to develop an indigenous geography curriculum. Students will make observations of culturally and\/or traditionally significant plants to generate data sets for use in climate change impact assessments, and will also produce quantitative and qualitative presentations of the plant observation and meteorological data.  \n\n2) Continuing the Deployment and Analysis of PhenoCams in the Missouri River Basin through our AmericaView Partnership. This portion of the project will provide technical support for the ongoing calibration and maintenance of the distributed PhenoCam systems. The NC CSC will also help to provide additional coordination and technical support to ensure that AmericaView is able to initiate the analysis of comparing these camera observations with both satellite data products and weather and climate data.

Northern Great Plains Using Model-Based Scenario Planning","body":"<div>One of the biggest challenges facing resource managers today is not knowing exactly when, where, and how climate change effects will unfold. While models can be used to predict the types of impacts that climate change might have on a landscape, uncertainty remains surrounding factors such as how quickly changes will occur and how specific resources will respond.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nIn order to plan for this uncertain future, managers have begun to use a tool known as scenario planning. In this approach, a subset of global climate model projections are selected that represent a range of plausible future climate scenarios for a particular area. Through a series of facilitated workshops, managers can then explore different management options under each scenario, enabling them to be proactive in the face of uncertainty. However, selecting and synthesizing climate information for scenario planning requires significant time and skills, and it can be difficult to predict exactly how resources might respond to a combination of climate, management actions, and other factors.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nTherefore, the goals of this project are to develop a process for creating regional climate summaries that can also be used for local scenario planning, and to pilot an approach for enhancing scenario planning through simulation modeling. Researchers will draw on global climate model projections to develop several climate summaries for the northern Great Plains region. The summaries will then be used for local-scale climate adaptation planning efforts for Badlands National Park (South Dakota) and Knife River Indian Villages National Historical Site (North Dakota) and surrounding federal and tribal lands. A final step will be to develop a simulation model for the South Dakota site to help managers address the \u201cwhat if\u201d questions regarding how management actions might affect focal resources under the different scenarios.<\/div>\n&nbsp;<br>\nNot only will this project improve climate adaptation efforts in the northern Great Plains region, but it will also result in a new, integrative approach for identifying how climate change might affect key resources of management concern at a local-scale and what actions can be taken to protect these resources \u2013 a method that could be applied to management units across the country.","purpose":"Climate change is expressed in both regional climatic shifts (e.g., temperature and precipitation changes) and local resource impacts. Resource management in a changing climate is challenging because future climate change and resource responses cannot be precisely predicted. Scenario planning is a tool to assess the range of plausible future conditions. However, selecting, acquiring, synthesizing, and scaling climate information for scenario planning requires significant time and skills. This project has three goals: 1) synthesize climate data into 3-5 distinctly different but plausible climate summaries for the northern Great Plains region; 2) craft summaries of these climate futures that are relevant to local land management units; and 3) apply these local summaries to further develop quantitative climate-resource-management scenarios through participatory workshops and simulation models. We will engage multiple stakeholders in two focal areas within the region: southwestern South Dakota in the vicinity of Badlands National Park, and central North Dakota in the vicinity of Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site. This effort will increase climate change planning efficiency in the region; promote collaborations across jurisdictions; and develop a prototype for a novel, efficient, and replicable form of scenario planning that could serve additional management units.","parentId":"55119ac9e4b02e76d75b5168","contacts":[{"name":"Amy Symstad","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"asymstad@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"6057451191","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"57747","country":"USA","city":"Hot Springs","state":"SD","line1":"Wind Cave National Park, 26611 US Hwy 385"}}},{"name":"Brian Miller","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"Brian.Miller@colostate.edu","organization":{"displayText":"Colorado State University"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"970-491-7659","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"USA","city":"Fort Collins","state":"CO","line1":"Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory"}}},{"name":"North Central CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Nicholas A.

We will develop a streamlined and standardized process to generate 3-5 climate summaries (figures, tables, and narratives describing plausible climate futures) for the northern Great Plains. We will then apply these climate summaries to management-scale scenario planning efforts in two focal areas - southwestern South Dakota (SW SD) and central North Dakota (central ND). In each focal area, project personnel will work with a variety of cooperators and partners to develop qualitative and quantitative climate-resource- management scenarios through a sequence of participatory scenario planning workshops paired with simulation modeling of key management targets. Products will include regional and local climate summaries, reports on the descriptive scenarios and management options, and simulation model summaries of plausible futures. This work will not only provide climate summaries for later use by others in this region, but will also provide a framework that can be applied in other management units in the North Central domain and beyond."},{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Agreement Number","value":"G15AP00072"},{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Agreement Type","value":"Grant"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Type","value":"Grant"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Number","value":"G15AP00072"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":50644,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":25840},{"year":"2016","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":24804}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":1280,"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":1314076,"useForPreview":true,"dateUploaded":"2016-07-08T19:44:52.000Z","name":"NC-2015-3_GreatPlains_AmySymstad_USGS.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__48\/e5\/dd\/48e5dde9b83d524c28cc52e2f1f0fb7661619da2","title":"The Great Plains - Credit: Amy Symstad","contentType":"image\/jpeg","imageHeight":958,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55159d7fe4b03238427817eb?f=__disk__48%2Fe5%2Fdd%2F48e5dde9b83d524c28cc52e2f1f0fb7661619da2"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/55159d7fe4b03238427817eb?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/55159d7fe4b03238427817eb?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=55159d7fe4b03238427817eb&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=55159d7fe4b03238427817eb&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=55159d7fe4b03238427817eb&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=55159d7fe4b03238427817eb","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/55159d7fe4b03238427817eb\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55159d7fe4b03238427817eb","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"ClimateChangeAd.zip","files":""}],"csc":"North Central CSC","parent_id":"4f83509de4b0e84f60868124","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Amy Symstad","Brian Miller","Nicholas A.

Sagebrush ecosystems cover large areas of the western United States and provide habitat for key species currently in consideration for listing under the Endangered Species Act. Here, we propose a working group to develop forecasts of the distribution and abundance of big sagebrush in response to projected climate change to inform conservation planning and sage grouse management in particular across the Intermountain West. The novelty of our work will be a synthesis of modeling approaches based on both empirically-derived spatial and temporal patterns as well as applying mechanistic modeling approaches to estimate sagebrush ecosystem dynamics. Combining species distribution models and process based dynamic global vegetation models will provide new insights into the range of sagebrush beyond \u2018presence-absence\u2019 relationships by considering abundance and the role of species interactions and disturbance from fire. Expected products include geospatial datasets for a range of sagebrush ecosystem variables from present time to year 2100, which include abundance, and also carbon and water related variables (i.e., net primary production, biomass, leaf area index), and information on disturbance regimes (fire return interval, fire severity). These data will be distributed following the National Science Foundation (NSF) Data One guidelines. The project partners and collaborators include University researchers and State and Federal Agencies and Extension scientists that are currently part of an NSF-funded collaborative effort led by Dr. Peter Adler since 2013. By providing a new perspective on sagebrush ecosystem dynamics that is a hybrid of empirical and mechanistic modeling scenarios for climate change projections, we expect to increase the capacity for land managers to make informed decisions for mitigating climate impacts and assessing climate vulnerability for this critically important system."},{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Agreement

change consequences for soil water resources","body":"<p>In the coming century, climate change is projected to impact precipitation and temperature regimes worldwide, with especially large effects in drylands. We use big sagebrush ecosystems as a model dryland ecosystem to explore the impacts of altered climate on ecohydrology and the implications of those changes for big sagebrush plant communities using output from 10 Global Circulation Models (GCMs) for two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). We ask: 1) What is the magnitude of variability in future temperature and precipitation regimes among GCMs and RCPs for big sagebrush ecosystems and 2) How will altered climate and uncertainty in climate forecasts influence key aspects of big sagebrush water balance? We explored these questions across 1980-2010, 2030-2060, and 2070-2100 to determine how changes in water balance might develop through the 21st century. We assessed ecohydrological variables at 898 sagebrush sites across the western US using a process-based soil water model, SOILWAT to model all components of daily water balance using site-specific vegetation parameters and site-specific soil properties for multiple soil layers. Our modeling approach allowed for changes in vegetation based on climate. Temperature increased across all GCMs and RCPs, while changes in precipitation were more variable across GCMs. Winter and spring precipitation was predicted to increase in the future (7% by 2030-2060, 12% by 2070-2100), resulting in slight increases in soil water potential (SWP) in winter. Despite wetter winter soil conditions, SWP decreased in late spring and summer due to increased evapotranspiration (6% by 2030-2060, 10% by 2070-2100) and groundwater recharge (26% and 30% increase by 2030-2060 and 2070-2100). Thus, despite increased precipitation in the cold season, soils may dry out earlier in the year, resulting in potentially longer drier summer conditions. If winter precipitation cannot offset drier summer conditions in the future, we expect big sagebrush regeneration and survival will be negatively impacted, potentially resulting in shifts in the relative abundance of big sagebrush plant functional groups. Our results also highlight the importance of assessing multiple GCMs to understand the range of climate change outcomes on ecohydrology, which was contingent on the GCM chosen.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["55196000e4b0323842782fdf"],"contacts":[{"name":"Kyle A.

The U.S. Northern Rockies still support a full suite of native wildlife, and survival of these populations depends on connected landscapes. Connected landscapes support current migration and dispersal as well as future shifts in species ranges that will be necessary due to our changing climate. Working in partnership with state and federal resource managers and private land trusts, we seek to 1) understand how future climate change may alter habitat composition of landscapes expected to serve as important connections for wildlife, 2) understand how wildlife species of concern are expected to respond to these changes, 3) develop climate-smart strategies to help stakeholders manage public and private lands in ways that allow wildlife to continue to move in response to changing conditions, and 4) explore how well existing management plans and conservation efforts are expected to support crucial connections for wildlife under climate change. Ultimately, this project aims to ensure that the iconic landscapes of the Northern Rockies and the wildlife they support endure in a changing landscape for the benefit of future generations.<\/div>\n","parentId":"55119ac9e4b02e76d75b5168","contacts":[{"name":"Steven Hostetler","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"swhostet@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Branch of Regional Research, Western Region"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"5417378928","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"97331","country":"USA","city":"Corvallis","state":"OR","line1":"College of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, Oregon State University"}}},{"name":"North Central CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Meredith McClure","oldPartyId":66323,"type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"meredith@largelandscapes.org","active":true,"firstName":"Meredith","lastName":"McClure","organization":{"displayText":"Center for Large Landscape Conservation"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Bray J.

Enhancing landscape connectivity is the most frequently recommended climate adaptation strategy. In cooperation with the Great Northern LCC and in partnership with state and federal land and wildlife managers, private land trust partnership staff, and large landscape conservation practitioners, the objectives of this project are to a) assess the vulnerability of landscapes that are crucial for wildlife connectivity in the U.S. Northern Rockies to climate change, and b) to develop decision-relevant adaptation strategies for climate-based management and conservation action in these landscapes. We propose to: 1) use projected future biome distributions to estimate ecologically relevant exposure of connectivity landscapes to climate change, 2) score sensitivity of focal wildlife species to biome transitions and quantify adaptive capacity in the context of fragmentation due to human land use, 3) develop adaptation strategies for priority landscapes that are robust to uncertainty in future conditions and ecological responses, and 4) conduct a gap analysis of the extent to which existing management plans and conservation efforts support future connectivity needs under a changing climate. These efforts will culminate in a report, spatial data products, and map-based decision support tool that are tailored to the needs of resource managers and conservation practitioners and offered freely via ScienceBase, Data Basin, and partners\u2019 data portals."}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"}],"files":[{"imageWidth":1818,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2017-01-04T18:25:12.000Z","title":"Absaroka Range, on the Montana - Wyoming border - Credit: Diane Renkin, NPS","imageHeight":1365,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55119ae6e4b02e76d75b516b?f=__disk__05%2F29%2F53%2F052953fdb8323cfb1ec7ea2e991004f353d144b8","processed":false,"size":849667,"useForPreview":true,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"77ff73174f70ac172ad7919227dc484f"},"name":"AbsarokaRange_MT-WY_DianeRenkin_NPS.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__05\/29\/53\/052953fdb8323cfb1ec7ea2e991004f353d144b8","contentType":"image\/jpeg"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/55119ae6e4b02e76d75b516b?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/55119ae6e4b02e76d75b516b?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=55119ae6e4b02e76d75b516b&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=55119ae6e4b02e76d75b516b&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=55119ae6e4b02e76d75b516b&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=55119ae6e4b02e76d75b516b","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/55119ae6e4b02e76d75b516b\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/55119ae6e4b02e76d75b516b","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"InformingAdapta.zip","files":""}],"csc":"North Central CSC","parent_id":"4f83509de4b0e84f60868124","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Steven Hostetler","Meredith McClure","Bray J.

The project\u2019s decision target is a WRIR Drought Management Plan that integrates state-of-the art climate science with hydrologic, social, and ecological vulnerabilities and risks, and identifies response capacities and strategies to support the Tribal Water Code and related resources management.","parentId":"55119ac9e4b02e76d75b5168","contacts":[{"name":"Cody Knutson","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"cknutson1@unl.edu","organization":{"displayText":"National Drought Mitigation Center, University of Nebraska-Lincoln"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"(402) 472-6718","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"68583-0988","country":"USA","city":"Lincoln","state":"Nebraska","line1":"821 Hardin Hall"}}},{"name":"Shannon McNeeley","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"shannon.mcneeley@colostate.edu","organization":{"displayText":"North Central Climate Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"970-491-1852","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"80523","country":"null","city":"Fort Collins","state":"Colorado","line1":"1231 East Drive"}}},{"name":"Mark Svoboda","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"msvboda2@unl.edu","organization":{"displayText":"National Drought Mitigation Center, University of Nebraska-Lincoln"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"402-472-8238","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"68583","country":"USA","city":"Lincoln","state":"Nebraska","line1":"815 Hardin Hall"}}},{"name":"Mitchel Cottenoir","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"mtcott@wyoming.com","organization":{"displayText":"Shoshone and Arapaho Tribes Office of the Tribal Water Engineer"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"307-332-6464","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"82517","country":"USA","city":"Fort Washakie","state":"Wyoming","line1":"Box 217"}}},{"name":"Jennifer Wellman","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"jwellma2@uwyo.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University of Wyoming EPSCoR"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"307-438-9744","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"82514","country":"USA","city":"Fort Washakie","state":"Wyoming","line1":"Box 159, 3 Ethete Road"}}},{"name":"North Central CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Tonya Bernardt","type":"Project Team","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Nebraska - Lincoln"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"adaptation"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"decision-making"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"drought"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"tribal"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"vulnerability"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Wind River"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"North Central CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2015"}],"dates":{"0":{"type":"Start","dateString":"2015-06-01","label":"Start Date"},"1":{"type":"End","dateString":"2017-09-30","label":"End Date"},"2":{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-03-27T12:11:23.634-06:00","label":"Date Created"},"3":{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-12-07T09:14:31.056-07:00","label":"Last Updated"},"start":"2015","end":"2017","other":[{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2015-03-27T12:11:23.634-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-12-07T09:14:31.056-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Technical Summary","value":"The Wind River Indian Reservation (WRIR) in west-central Wyoming is home to the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes who reside near and depend on snowpack and glacier-fed tributaries to the Wind River, headwaters of the Missouri Basin. The region experiences frequent, severe drought events that cause devastating impacts to the social and ecological systems. The WRIR does not have an established process for collecting drought-related data or managing drought conditions. Therefore, this project will conduct an assessment of key climatological and social-ecological vulnerabilities, risks, and response capacities of the WRIR to inform the development of a drought management plan. This is essential for allocating critical water resources to meet agricultural and other societal needs while maintaining ecosystem health. It will be guided by tribal needs, Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and indigenous observations of drought, and will utilize collaborative community outreach and education efforts. The project will apply innovative vulnerability assessment models and methods and serve as a leading example for other tribes\u2019 drought preparedness. The project team will leverage the activities of several state and federal agencies in the region to achieve project goals. This project will add to the scientific base of integrated social-ecological-climate vulnerability assessment, as well as document the process and \u201clessons learned\u201d to be transferred to other tribes and vulnerable communities throughout the north central region and

We will assemble data on historical land switching in the area and on land conversion costs. We will analyze crop vulnerabilities to weather and climate change. We will provide practical analytical tools to assess the likelihood of grassland conversion to cropping and of the costs of protecting these lands under different climate and economic scenarios. These tools, together with insights we obtain from partners in the area will allow us to work with land conservation managers on identifying lands to target for grassland protection incentives under alternative climate and economic scenarios. Outputs will be used to collaborate with land conservation managers when comparing strategies for ensuring that lands providing high wildlife and habitat benefits at low conservation cost are conserved while private landowners are happy to forgo land use alternatives.<\/div>\n","parentId":"55119ac9e4b02e76d75b5168","contacts":[{"name":"David A.

Recent high commodity prices and technological innovations have increased profits on non-grass crop agriculture. Consequently the cost of protection through land acquisition and grassland easements has increased, stressing limited conservation budget and resources. Climate projections for the East River Dakotas suggest a future more amenable to row crop production in the area. Land conservation managers must seek to balance habitat and wildlife benefits with conversion risks and protection costs. The goal of this research is to integrate climate information into strategic planning tools through two-way interaction with conservation managers and to contribute new understanding on factors affecting land use switches. Our specific objectives are four-fold: to understand the management environment and then co-identify conservation targets with partners; to assess the sensitivity of these targets to climate change, market environment and technical change; to co-identify management options; and to promote dialogue on practical implementing. We will do so through interactions with land conservation managers, through data assembly on historical land use switching, as well as meetings with private landowners. We will develop statistical models of land use switching, crop production vulnerability to climate change, and how stochastic returns to grass and crop production interact with conversion and switching costs. Expected outputs will include maps of land use switches, a land conversion budget framework, a land conversion choice calculator, as well as sensitivity analysis on alternative prices, production technologies and climate scenarios. Our cross-disciplinary team, consisting of a production economist, a natural resource economist, a climate scientist, and a landscape ecologist has extensive experience in related issues.

We first estimate a non-linear yield-weather relationship for all major commodities in the area: corn, soybeans, spring wheat and alfalfa. We separately identify benevolent and harmful temperature thresholds for each commodity, and control for severe-to-extreme dry\/wet conditions in our yield models. Analyzing all major commodities in a region extends the existing literature beyond just one crop, most typically corn yields. Alfalfa is particularly interesting since it is a legume-crop that is substitutable with grasses as animal feed and rotated with other row-crops for nitrogen-fixation of soils. Our model includes trend-weather and soil-weather interaction terms that extend the existing yield-weather models in the literature. Results suggest that temporal adaptations have not mitigated the negative impacts of weather stressors in the past, and that the spatial soil profile only weakly influences weather impacts on crop yields. We estimate yield-weather elasticities and find that historical weather patterns in the region have benefited corn and soybeans (spring wheat) the most (least). We expand our analysis to formally evaluate the role of short-run weather fluctuations in determining land-use decisions. We utilize decomposed crop yield estimates due to trend and weather in order to model crop acreage shares. Our preliminary results suggest that short-run weather fluctuations are an important factor for decisions on soybeans and spring wheat shares, however only yield trends drive corn shares.","parentId":"5515a218e4b0323842781836","contacts":[{"name":"Gaurav Arora","type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"gaurav88@iastate.edu","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Hongli Feng","oldPartyId":68611,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"hfeng@iastate.edu","active":true,"firstName":"Hongli","lastName":"Feng","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"David A.

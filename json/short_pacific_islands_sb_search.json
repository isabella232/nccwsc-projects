Increasing production of locally-grown food crops helps increase self-sufficiency and address nutritional problems that lead to high rates of diabetes and cardiovascular disease caused in part by over dependence on imported food.

Climate change impacts such as seawater intrusion, changes in precipitation, sea level rise, increasing air temperature and invasive species are making agriculture more difficult for island inhabitants to conduct.

Panel regression is used to overcome limitations of traditional regression methods, and obtain reliable model coefficients, in particular to understand the elasticity of streamflow to rainfall. Using annual rainfall and selected basin characteristics at 86 gaged streams in the Hawaiian Islands, regional regression models for three stream classes were developed to estimate the annual low-flow duration discharges. Three panel-regression structures (random effects, fixed effects, and pooled) were compared to traditional regression methods, in which space is substituted for time.

Many Marshallese communities are already experiencing these changes and are migrating to larger islands within the RMI and to other countries, like the U.S., to seek alternative means of making a living. The number of Marshallese residing in the U.S. has rapidly risen over the past two decades, from 7,000 in 2000 to 22,000 in 2010.\n\nThe factors triggering human migration are complex and often intertwined, making it difficult to pinpoint and address specific causes from a public policy perspective. For example, changes in ecosystems due to climate change can cause health problems or food insecurity which may have greater consequences in communities with political, social, or economic tension.\n\nDecision makers at loc...","type":["Project"],"parent_id":"4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48"},"195":{"id":"568ed82fe4b0e7a44bc59ba0","fy":"Unknown","title":"Understanding the P\u016bn\u0101wai of Keaukaha, HI - PIPES Intern Report","authors":["Cherie Kauahi"],"csc":["Pacific Islands CSC"],"keywords":["freshwater","precipitation","tides"],"dates":{"other":[{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2015-08-07","label":"Date Reported"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-01-07T14:27:11.522-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-01-07T14:29:39.561-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}]},"status":"Unknown","author-orgs":["PIPES Intern"],"body":"Global climate change is altering the natural state of the earth. Ecosystems around the world are being affected with a large concern being the availability of freshwater.

And although Hawai\u02bbi is not currently experiencing unavailability of freshwater resources the focus of this study is to begin to understand one of the most abundant freshwater resources in Hawai\u02bbi, freshwater springs. Three approaches were used to begin understanding the freshwater springs in Keaukaha, HI; reading through literature, conducting field surveys as well as conducting informal interviews. Through the field surveys it was found that shoreline springs are easier to sample at lower low tides during new and full moons. It was also found that the shoreline springs move with the tides.

Along with increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and warming temperatures, rainfall, cloud cover, storm frequency, and other aspects of climate will also change. These shifts are likely to have effects on plants, such as changing the amount of water they use or how fast they grow. In this project, we investigated the connections between environmental conditions (such as temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, humidity, wind speed, soil moisture) and plant water use and growth rates of two forest ecosystems in Hawai\u2018i. Based on those connections, we sought to project how a specific set of possible future climate changes will affect water use and growth of these forests.

Such a concern is present globally, but the Hawaiian Islands have special issues in terms of vulnerability of their small, geographically isolated watersheds and ecosystems. The Hawaiian Islands are notable in that they have received considerably less attention from the climate modeling community than most other populated areas of the world. Due to their small dimensions and steep topography, the Hawaiian Islands are poorly resolved in current state-of-the-art global models used for long-term climate simulations. This project will apply a very fine-resolution regional model to downscale global model results to provide the best possible representations of recent past climate and projections of future climate.

We used a model of forest birds, mosquitoes, and avian malaria to evaluate future impacts of avian malaria on these Hawaiian birds as a result of climate change. As climate warms during the 21st Century temperatures will favor increased mosquito populations and much higher transmission of malaria to endangered honeycreepers existing in high-elevation forests.

Preliminary review of the scientific literature of the watershed indicates that there is an unequal distribution of research foci, and that there are large parts of the watershed for which there is little scientific information, especially about the linkages among physical and ecological processes and human-caused perturbations in those processes.\r\nThis project also seeks to inventory and review available water resource models used to meet multiple (and often competing) water resource management objectives. We will specifically evaluate the applicability of those models to evaluating trade-offs in meeting societal and environmental flow requirements to recover native ecosystems.\r\nThe body of work proposed here will communicate the state of RBG science to diverse stakeholders, researchers, and decision-makers, identify information gaps that merit additional research and resources, describe promising future steps to couple and improve existing systems models, and propose ideas to share and serve science syntheses in digital and spatially-explicit databases.

In order to plan for future conditions and challenges, it is crucial that managers understand the limitations and uncertainties associated with the characterization of these changes when making management decisions. Changes in consumptive water use (water removed without return to a water resources system) will change streamflow, impacting downstream water users, their livelihoods, as well as aquatic ecosystems. Historical changes in available water may be attributed to changes in precipitation; but these changes may also be attributable to changes in consumptive use. Understanding the roles of natural and anthropogenic influences on the water cycle is an important component of this project. The objective of this project was to provide an automated methodology and data products that the public can view, work with, and download through ScienceBase to assess: the accuracy of available climate data and climate projections, the hydrologic effects of these drivers on runoff for historical and future conditions, and the role of consumptive water use on available water supply.","parentId":"52680a1ee4b0c24c90857576","contacts":[{"name":"Lauren Hay","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"lhay@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"USGS National Research Program Branch of Regional Research, Central Region"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"3032367279","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"80225-0046","country":"USA","city":"Denver","state":"CO","line1":"Box 25046, Denver Federal Center, Mail Stop 412"}}},{"name":"Andy Bock","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Colorado Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jacob LaFontaine","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Georgia Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Gregory J.

Macroclimatic drivers have been the focus of climate-change related threat evaluations for terrestrial ecosystems, but largely ignored for coastal wetlands. In some coastal wetlands, changing macroclimatic conditions are expected to result in foundation plant species replacement, which would affect the supply of certain ecosystem goods and services and could affect ecosystem resilience. As examples, we highlight several ecological transition zones where small changes in macroclimatic conditions would result in comparatively large changes in coastal wetland ecosystem structure and function. Our intent in this communication is not to minimize the importance of sea-level rise. Rather, our overarching aim is to illustrate the need to also consider macroclimatic drivers within vulnerability assessments for coastal wetlands.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["505b584fe4b08c986b30c22f","52254414e4b0e4746d62aff7"],"contacts":[{"name":"Michael J.

Scientists examining potential future changes in these processes require spatially explicit, LULC projections that include impacts of climate and precipitation variability. Similarly, planners, policy-makers, and other decision-makers require LULC projections to understand the impacts and feedbacks of climate and land-use change. USGS EROS has produced unprecedented national-scale LULC projections for four IPCC scenarios from 1992 to 2100. However, the characteristics of these data may not meet the needs of many stakeholders. Tools are required that allow stakeholders to develop their own customized climate-based LULC projections to support their unique conservation application. This work would facilitate the development of a stand-alone modeling tool that enables stakeholders to quickly develop custom, climate-based LULC projections to satisfy the needs of their specific conservation application. Proposal funds will be used for five primary purposes: 1) Conduct an initial workshop of stakeholders to gather aggregate requirements for a stand-alone climate-based LULC model. A diverse set of stakeholders (scientists, land-use planners, policy-makers, and others who require projected land-use data) would be invited to participate. The in-person workshop would gather individual needs for projected, climate-based LULC information, and work towards a set of common framework characteristics that would maximize potential use across all stakeholder groups. 2) Design and construct an integrated climate-based LULC model for use by external stakeholders, using workshop results as guidance. Development of the model will focus not only on functionality (ability to model the complete suite of potential landscape changes under a changing climate), but on a user-friendly interface, allowing stakeholders to easily produce their own climate-based LULC projections. 3) Complete a web-based modeling resource. This resource would include (1) data sets to support modeling activities, 2) model support, including model documentation and user discussion sections, and 3) resource sharing, where users could freely share both supporting data and model results. 4) Conduct a second workshop to apply and evaluate the model. Stakeholders will use the new model, along with the necessary (supplied) data and support tools, to generate customized climate-based LULC projections to suit their own needs. Users will be asked to formally evaluate the model, and provide suggestions for future research and model development. 5) Complete a peer-reviewed journal paper summarizing the research and results. The net outcome of the work will be the design of new LULC modeling software suitable for use by variety of stakeholders across the SC-CSC region, enabling stakeholders to explore, assess, and potentially mitigate the impacts of climate on LULC change and an array of ecological processes.

Downscaling methods can be applied to the outputs of GCMs to give guidance appropriate for a more regional level. No standard approach to downscaling currently exists, however, and the process often results in climate projections that suggest a wide array of possible futures. It is critical that decision-makers looking to incorporate climate information understand the uncertainties associated with different downscaling approaches and can evaluate downscaled data to determine which datasets are appropriate for addressing their questions.<br>\n<br>\nThe goal of this project is to provide decision-makers with this information by evaluating the uncertainties associated with different downscaled datasets.

We propose an analysis of historical observations and climate model projections to assess the processes that factor into annual water supply outlooks for the upper Rio Grande. Water supply outlooks are a hydrologic version of short-term climate predictions. They are strongly influenced by trends in snowpack associated with climate change, and by natural multidecadal fluctuations in winter and spring precipitation, both of which affect the expected value of streamflow following ablation of snowpack in the Rio Grande headwaters drainages. Large interannual fluctuations in post-snowmelt precipitation also affect flows and tend to limit streamflow predictability. On multidecadal climate change time scales, the effect of increasing temperature on snowpack and ET is projected to become the first-order process responsible for projections of diminished streamflow, subject to continued large interannual and decadal fluctuations of precipitation. In the proposed research these processes will be incorporated into statistical prediction models for Rio Grande streamflow, similar to the models used operationally by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service for their current operational water supply outlooks. The sensitivity of these prediction models to historical period of record will be quantified, and if possible attributed to specific components of climate variability and change. Then the statistical models will be applied to more complex climate change projections generated by coupled dynamical models. The results of the research will place constraints on the predictability of streamflow associated with winter snowpack, identify changes to streamflow predictability over the past several decades (a period of rapid observed warming), and assess future predictability."}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Type","value":"Grant"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Award Number","value":"G16AP00114"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":92915,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2016","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":92915}]}],"files":[{"imageWidth":1746,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-11-22T19:50:51.000Z","title":"Rio Grande River - Credit: Alan Cressler","imageHeight":1310,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/580e2a3ae4b0f497e7946c7c?f=__disk__a6%2F62%2F1c%2Fa6621c3f38c93ced9f50126338a5ad153b542505","processed":false,"size":618824,"useForPreview":true,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f1de3a782ebbcc727571760de9055008"},"name":"RioGrandeRiver_AlanCressler.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__a6\/62\/1c\/a6621c3f38c93ced9f50126338a5ad153b542505","contentType":"image\/jpeg"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/580e2a3ae4b0f497e7946c7c?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/580e2a3ae4b0f497e7946c7c?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=580e2a3ae4b0f497e7946c7c&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=580e2a3ae4b0f497e7946c7c&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=580e2a3ae4b0f497e7946c7c&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=580e2a3ae4b0f497e7946c7c","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/580e2a3ae4b0f497e7946c7c\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/580e2a3ae4b0f497e7946c7c","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"ClimateVariabil.zip","files":""}],"csc":"South Central CSC","parent_id":"4f8c652fe4b0546c0c397b4a","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["David Gutzler"],"orgs":["South Central CSC"],"funding_years":"2016","fy":"2016"},"542dc386e4b092f17defcae8":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5012de5ce4b05140039e03c4","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"coastal Texas marsh survey points - 2011","relatedTitle":"Delineation of Fresh, Intermediate, Brackish and Saline Marsh Types of the North Central Gulf of Mexico Coast","id":"542dc386e4b092f17defcae8","relatedId":"5012de5ce4b05140039e03c4","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/542dc386e4b092f17defcae8","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Delineation of Fresh, Intermediate, Brackish and Saline Marsh Types of the North Central Gulf of Mexico Coast","relatedTitle":"coastal Texas marsh survey points - 2011","id":"5012de5ce4b05140039e03c4","relatedId":"542dc386e4b092f17defcae8","annotation":null}]},"id":"542dc386e4b092f17defcae8","title":"coastal Texas marsh survey points - 2011","body":"This data set contains vector point information.

Exposure, Impacts, and Adaptation in the South Central U.S.","body":"<div>The threat of droughts and their associated impacts on the landscape and human communities has long been recognized in the United States, especially in high risk areas such as the South Central region. There is ample literature on the effects of long-term climate change and short-term&nbsp;climate variability on the occurrence of droughts. However, it is unclear whether this information meets the needs of relevant stakeholders and actually contributes to reducing the vulnerability or increasing the resilience of communities to droughts. For example, are the methods used to characterize the severity of drought \u2013 known as drought indices \u2013 effective tools for predicting the actual damage felt by communities?<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nAs droughts continue to increase in frequency and severity, the need to understand community vulnerability and resilience to drought is only growing. Focusing on New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, this study sought to answer several key questions. First, researchers examined whether existing drought indices are effective in predicting the occurrence of drought events and their actual damages. Second, researchers explored why some communities suffer less damage from drought and recover faster than others. Finally, researchers identified strategies for encouraging the adoption of water conservation behaviors among residents. So far, results show that drought indices are overall useful tools for predicting drought damage and that a community\u2019s resilience to drought is often tied to socioeconomic conditions.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThis research was conducted in partnership with two Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. In addition to gaining the scientific knowledge of the linkages between drought indices, damages, and community resilience, this research (1) developed tools to measure drought resilience, (2) identified key indicators of resilience, (3) identified the gaps between drought indices and actual damages, and (4) identified the factors that influence residents\u2019 decisions to adopt adaptive measures.<\/div>\n","purpose":"The threat of droughts and their associated impacts on the landscape and human communities has long been recognized in the United States, especially in high risk areas such as the South Central region.

Detailed information on the extent and distribution of marsh vegetation zones throughout the Texas coast has been historically unavailable. In response, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation and collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service via the Gulf Coast Joint Venture, Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, the University of Louisiana-Lafayette, and Ducks Unlimited, Inc., has produced a classification of marsh vegetation types along the middle and upper Texas coast from Corpus Christi Bay to the Sabine River. This study incorporates approximately 1,000 ground reference locations collected via helicopter surveys in coastal marsh areas and about 2,000 supplemental locations from fresh marsh, water, and \u201cother\u201d (that is, nonmarsh) areas. About two-thirds of these data were used for training, and about one-third were used for assessing accuracy. Decision-tree analyses using Rulequest See5 were used to classify emergent marsh vegetation types by using these data, multitemporal satellite-based multispectral imagery from 2009 to 2011, a bare-earth digital elevation model (DEM) based on airborne light detection and ranging (lidar), alternative contemporary land cover classifications, and other spatially explicit variables believed to be important for delineating the extent and distribution of marsh vegetation communities. Image objects were generated from segmentation of high-resolution airborne imagery acquired in 2010 and were used to refine the classification. The classification is dated 2010 because the year is both the midpoint of the multitemporal satellite-based imagery (2009\u201311) classified and the date of the high-resolution airborne imagery that was used to develop image objects. Overall accuracy corrected for bias (accuracy estimate incorporates true marginal proportions) was 91 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI]: 89.2\u201392.8), with a kappa statistic of 0.79 (95 percent CI: 0.77\u20130.81). The classification performed best for saline marsh (user\u2019s accuracy 81.5 percent; producer\u2019s accuracy corrected for bias 62.9 percent) but showed a lesser ability to discriminate intermediate marsh (user\u2019s accuracy 47.7 percent; producer\u2019s accuracy corrected for bias 49.5 percent). Because of confusion in intermediate and brackish marsh classes, an alternative classification containing only three marsh types was created in which intermediate and brackish marshes were combined into a single class. Image objects were reattributed by using this alternative three-marsh-type classification. Overall accuracy, corrected for bias, of this more general classification was 92.4 percent (95 percent CI: 90.7\u201394.2), and the kappa statistic was 0.83 (95 percent CI: 0.81\u20130.85). Mean user\u2019s accuracy for marshes within the four-marsh-type and three-marsh-type classifications was 65.4 percent and 75.6 percent, respectively, whereas mean producer\u2019s accuracy was 56.7 percent and 65.1 percent, respectively.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>This study provides a more objective and repeatable method for classifying marsh types of the middle and upper Texas coast at an extent and greater level of detail than previously available for the study area. The seamless classification produced through this work is now available to help State agencies (such as the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department) and landscape-scale conservation partnerships (such as the Gulf Coast Prairie Landscape Conservation Cooperative and the Gulf Coast Joint Venture) to develop and (or) refine conservation plans targeting priority natural resources. Moreover, these data may improve projections of landscape change and serve as a baseline for monitoring future changes resulting from chronic and episodic stressors.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["504f8893e4b03f3ccc029113"],"contacts":[{"name":"Nicholas M.

More than half of the Rio Grande\u2019s streamflow originates as snowmelt in Colorado\u2019s mountains, meaning that changes in the amount of snowmelt can impact the water supply for communities along the entire river. Snowmelt runoff is therefore an important component of water supply outlooks for the region, which are used by a variety of stakeholders to anticipate water availability in the springtime.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nIt is critical that these water supply outlooks be as accurate as possible. Errors can cost states millions of dollars due to mis-allocation of water and lost agricultural productivity. There is a perception that runoff forecast accuracy has declined over the last several decades in Colorado and New Mexico, making water supply outlooks less reliable. Declines in accuracy could be related to changes in climate and land cover; however, potential sources of error have not yet been examined in the upper Rio Grande basin.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThis study aims to improve runoff forecast models for the upper Rio Grande. Researchers will identify potential sources of error in existing models, improve the representation of snowpack in models of the watershed, develop a new hydrologic model for the basin, and test this model\u2019s ability to forecast runoff. The end product of this study will be a tool for making improved runoff forecasts for the upper Rio Grande basin. The tool will be transferable to other snowmelt-dominated basins in the region that have similar characteristics. These improved runoff forecasts, in turn, can be used to develop more accurate water supply outlooks in the region, empowering stakeholders in the basin to plan their water use more effectively.&nbsp;<\/div>\n","purpose":"Snow is a critical water resource in the western United States (U.S.). Seasonal snowpacks serve as large natural reservoirs in the Rocky Mountain west that store water through the winter and release it during spring and summer months when demand is greatest; melting snowpacks often supply water to meet demands hundreds of miles away from the source (Mote 2006). In the Rio Grande Basin (RGB), snowmelt from seasonal snowpacks in the headwater area supplies 50 \u2013 75% of annual basin streamflow (Rango 2006); therefore, water supply forecasts provided prior to the snowmelt season are of upmost importance for water management decision making. Errors in these statistically-based water supply forecasts are ubiquitous, and forecasting skill has declined over time in certain areas of the country such as Colorado and New Mexico (Pagano et al. 2004). Process changes related to changing climate, land cover, and\/or dust deposition, or operational changes in data collection and forecasting may be responsible for this worsening of forecast skill (Pagano et al. 2004). Understanding the conditions that have led to large errors in existing forecasts is an important step towards making science-based recommendations for improving future water supply forecasts in the RGB. This study proposes to evaluate the performance of various operational products for forecasting spring and summer streamflow in the Rio Grande Headwaters basin at the Rio Grande Near Del Norte gage from 2000 through 2015. The products that will be evaluated include the NRCS water supply forecasts, NWS River Forecast Center forecasts, and outputs from the NOHRSC Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS). In this study, we will quantify errors in each product in recent years, and will investigate conditions and processes associated with large forecasting errors. Additionally, in collaboration with the USGS National Water Census Program and the NRCS Colorado Snow Survey Program, we propose to test coupling of a physically-based snowpack evolution model (SnowModel) with a physically-based hydrologic model (Precipitation Runoff Modeling System, or PRMS). We will compare streamflow runoff estimates derived from this physically-based modeling approach to those from existing, empirical operational forecasting techniques for the 2016 and 2017 water years. This research will provide recommendations on (1) what currently operational forecasting method provides the best performance over a range of conditions in the Rio Grande Headwaters, and (2) how operational forecasts in the RGB could be improved using new technologies and methods.","parentId":"580f9a22e4b0f497e796004b","contacts":[{"name":"David Clow","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"dwclow@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Colorado Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"3032366881","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"80225-0046","country":"USA","city":"Denver","state":"CO","line1":"Box 25046, Denver Federal Center, Mail Stop 415"}}},{"name":"Colin Penn","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Colorado WSC"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"null","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"null","state":"null","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"Graham Sexstone","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Colorado WSC"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"null","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"null","state":"null","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"South Central CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"South Central CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2016"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2016","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-10-21T15:54:46.339-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-29T10:14:24.258-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Technical Summary","value":"Snow is a critical water resource in the western United States (U.S.).

We investigated temporal variation in DO at Barton Springs, Austin, Texas, USA. During 2006\u20132012, DO fluctuated by as much as a factor of 2, and at some periods decreased to concentrations that adversely affect the Barton Springs salamander (Eurycea sorosum) (\u22644.4 mg\/L), a federally listed endangered species endemic to Barton Springs. DO was lowest (\u22644.4 mg\/L) when discharge was low (\u22641 m<sup>3<\/sup>\/s) and spring water temperature was &gt;21 \u00b0C, although not at a maximum; the minimum DO recorded was 4.0 mg\/L. Relatively low DO (&lt;6 mg\/L) also was measured at relatively high discharge (3.2 m<sup>3<\/sup>\/s) and maximum T (22.2 \u00b0C). A four-segment linear regression model with daily data for discharge and spring water temperature as explanatory variables provided an excellent fit for mean daily DO (Nash\u2013Sutcliffe coefficient for the validation period of 0.90). DO also fluctuated at short-term timescales in response to storms, and DO measured at 15-min intervals could be simulated with a combination of discharge, spring temperature, and specific conductance as explanatory variables. On the basis of the daily-data regression model, we hypothesize that more frequent low DO corresponding to salamander mortality could result from (i) lower discharge from Barton Springs resulting from increased groundwater withdrawals or decreased recharge as a result of climate change, and (or) (ii) higher groundwater temperature as a result of climate change.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["52d563cbe4b0f19e63da8658"],"contacts":[{"name":"Barbara J.

This research analyzes the relationship between two readily accessible drought indices\u2014the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Palmer Hydrologic Drought Index (PHDI)\u2014and the damage incurred by such droughts in terms of monetary loss, over the 1975\u20132010 time period on monthly basis, for five states in the south-central USA. Because drought damage in the Spatial Hazards Events and Losses Database for the United States (SHELDUS\u2122) is reported at the county level, statistical downscaling techniques were used to estimate the county-level PDSI and PHDI. Correlation analysis using the downscaled indices suggests that although relatively few county\u2013months contain drought damage reports, drought indices can be useful predictors of drought damage at the monthly temporal scale extended to 12&nbsp;months and at the county-level spatial scale. The varying time lags between occurrence of drought and reporting of damage, perhaps due to varying resilience to drought intensity and duration by crop types across space, along with differing irrigation schedules and adaptation measures of the community to drought over space and time, may contribute to weakened correlations. These results present a reminder of the complexities of anticipating the effects of drought, but they contribute to the effort to improve our ability to mitigate the effects of incipient drought.","parentId":"5318d347e4b0ae6e9d5a3c53","contacts":[{"name":"Springer Netherlands","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Robert V.

Climate change, through increased temperature, reduced rainfall, and increased rainfall intensity, is expected to reduce water availability and exacerbate the maintenance of ecological flows in the Arkansas-Red River basin. Understanding the nexus among climate change effects on streamflow, water quality, and stream ecology for watersheds in the Arkansas-Red River Basin can be achieved using currently existing science and technology. This nexus approach will strengthen adaptive-management strategies that focus on shared ecosystem conservation watershed targets. This approach will provide natural-resource managers operating over a variety of spatial scales with measureable relationships between biology and flow while building modeling, monitoring, and statistical capacity to support restoration, conservation, and management goals.","parentId":"52680a1ee4b0c24c90857576","linkParentIds":["54b6daafe4b03ff527031a07"],"contacts":[{"name":"William J Andrews","oldPartyId":248,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"wandrews@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Supervisory Hydrologist","personalTitle":"Mr.","firstName":"William","middleName":"J","lastName":"Andrews","organization":{"displayText":"USGS Oklahoma Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"4058437712","streetAddress":{"zip":"73116-8224","country":"US","city":"Oklahoma City","state":"OK","line1":"202 NW 66th Street"},"buildingCode":"KHA","name":"William J Andrews\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI -

In addition to providing fish and wildlife habitat, coastal wetlands can improve water quality, ameliorate flooding impacts, support coastal food webs, and protect coastlines. One strategy for preparing for the effects of sea-level rise is to ensure that there is space available for coastal wetlands to adapt to sea-level rise. In a recent study, we identified areas where coastal wetlands may adapt via landward migration along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast, one of the most sea-level rise sensitive and wetland-rich regions of the world. Here, we will follow-up on that work and produce customized landscape conservation-design products focused on landward migration corridors for coastal wetlands. In broad terms, the aim of the proposed work is to provide scientific information that can be used by environmental managers to enhance the adaptive capacity of coastal wetlands in the face of sea-level rise and coastal development.","parentId":"580f9a22e4b0f497e796004b","linkParentIds":["5813a352e4b0d63fd467bb00"],"contacts":[{"name":"Michael Osland","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"mosland@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"National Wetlands Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"3372668664","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"70506","country":"USA","city":"Lafayette","state":"LA","line1":"700 Cajundome Blvd."}}},{"name":"South Central CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Southeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"coastal wetlands"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"landward migration"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"sea-level rise"},{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"South Central CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Southeast CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2016"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2016","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-10-21T15:53:53.731-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-29T10:01:52.433-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Technical Summary","value":"In the 21st century, accelerated sea-level rise and continued coastal development are expected to greatly alter coastal landscapes across the globe. Historically, many coastal ecosystems have adapted to sea-level fluctuations via horizontal and vertical movement on the landscape. However, anthropogenic activities, including urbanization and the construction of flood-prevention infrastructure, can produce barriers that impede adaptation. In a recent study, we identified areas where tidal saline wetlands may adapt via landward migration along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast, one of the most sea-level rise sensitive and wetland-rich regions of the world. Our analyses collectively provided information that can be used to identify migration corridors and develop future-focused sea-level rise adaptation strategies that will improve the potential that the ecosystem goods and services provided by tidal saline wetlands will continue to be available for future generations. This project was a multi-Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) project that included the four Gulf coast LCCs (i.e., Gulf Coast Prairie, Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks, South Atlantic, and Peninsular Florida LCCs). The products and analyses from this work were produced at the region scale (i.e., all five Gulf coast states). However, there is much potential to use these data for customized analyses focused on landscape conservation design within specific estuaries (e.g., estuaries that contain ecologically-significant National Wildlife Refuges, National Estuarine Research Reserves, National Estuary Programs). Here we will perform follow-up work focused on the evaluation of landward migration corridors. We will work with LCC staff and partners from the four Gulf coast LCCs to identify 1-2 estuaries per LCC (4-8 estuaries total) for customized analyses. Within each of these estuaries, we will work with these partners to produce customized landscape conservation-design products focused on landward migration corridors for coastal wetlands. In broad terms, the aim of the proposed work is to provide scientific information that can be used by environmental managers to enhance the adaptive capacity of coastal wetlands in the face of sea-level rise and coastal development. The two PIs for this project are both at the USGS Wetland and Aquatic Research Center. The project will provide valuable experience and opportunities for two early-career researchers (a recent M.S. graduate and a current Ph.D. student). The formal products of the proposed research will include, at a minimum, a peer-reviewed publication and a webinar for natural resource managers."}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"}],"files":[{"imageWidth":910,"originalMetadata":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-10-25T18:03:18.000Z","title":"Everglades National Park - Credit: Alan Cressler","imageHeight":683,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__c9%2Fa2%2F8c%2Fc9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a","processed":false,"size":216551,"useForPreview":true,"checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"a46fa2b501ee68c5d65b648f34ce4ab0"},"name":"EvergladesNP2_AlanCressler.jpg","pathOnDisk":"__disk__c9\/a2\/8c\/c9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a","contentType":"image\/jpeg"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"EnhancingtheCap.zip","files":""}],"realParentId":"4f8c652fe4b0546c0c397b4a","csc":"South Central CSC","parent_id":"4f8c652fe4b0546c0c397b4a","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Michael Osland"],"orgs":["South Central CSC","Southeast CSC"],"funding_years":"2016","fy":"2016"},"5788ff91e4b0d27deb3890b9":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5012df8ce4b05140039e03c7","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Establishing a Baseline of Estuarine Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Resources Across Salinity Zones Within Coastal Areas of the Northern Gulf of Mexico","relatedTitle":"Occurrence and Variation in Submersed Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) Along the Northern Gulf of Mexico: A Hierarchical Approach to Assess Impacts of Environmental Change on SAV Resources","id":"5788ff91e4b0d27deb3890b9","relatedId":"5012df8ce4b05140039e03c7","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5788ff91e4b0d27deb3890b9","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Occurrence and Variation in Submersed Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) Along the Northern Gulf of Mexico: A Hierarchical Approach to Assess Impacts of Environmental Change on SAV Resources","relatedTitle":"Establishing a Baseline of Estuarine Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Resources Across Salinity Zones Within Coastal Areas of the Northern Gulf of Mexico","id":"5012df8ce4b05140039e03c7","relatedId":"5788ff91e4b0d27deb3890b9","annotation":null}]},"id":"5788ff91e4b0d27deb3890b9","title":"Establishing a Baseline of Estuarine Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Resources Across Salinity Zones Within Coastal Areas of the Northern Gulf of Mexico","parentId":"578cee4fe4b0c1aacabb4af7","contacts":[{"name":"Eva R.

In this project, researchers will use this zone of remarkable transition to develop macroclimate-based models for quantifying the regional responses of coastal wetland ecosystems to climate variation. In addition to providing important fish and wildlife habitat and supporting coastal food webs, these coastal wetlands provide many ecosystem goods and services including clean water, stable coastlines, food, recreational opportunities, and stored carbon. The project objective is to examine and forecast the effects of macroclimatic drivers on wetland ecosystem structure and function in the Gulf of Mexico. The first major step in meeting this overall objective will be to use structural equation modeling (SEM) to develop a multivariate understanding of the connections between climate and ecosystem structure. The research team will then incorporate the resulting information into quantitative vulnerability assessments that examine sensitivity (via observed data), exposure (via alternative future climate scenarios), and adaptive capacity (via life history literature).","parentId":"52680a1ee4b0c24c90857576","contacts":[{"name":"Michael Osland","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"mosland@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"USGS, National Wetlands Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"337-266-8664","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"70506","country":"USA","city":"Lafayette","state":"LA","line1":"U.S. Geological Survey, National Wetlands Research Center\r\n700 Cajundome Blvd."}}},{"name":"James B.

downscaling (ESD) methods seek to refine global climate model (GCM) outputs via processes that glean information from a combination of observations and GCM simulations. They aim to create value-added climate projections by reducing biases and adding finer spatial detail. Analysis techniques, such as cross-validation, allow assessments of how well ESD methods meet these goals during observational periods. However, the extent to which an ESD method\u2019s skill might differ when applied to future climate projections cannot be assessed readily in the same manner. Here we present a \u201cperfect model\u201d experimental design that quantifies aspects of ESD method performance for both historical and late 21st century time periods. The experimental design tests a key stationarity assumption inherent to ESD methods \u2013 namely, that ESD performance when applied to future projections is similar to that during the observational training period. Case study results employing a single ESD method (an Asynchronous Regional Regression Model variant) and climate variable (daily maximum temperature) demonstrate that violations of the stationarity assumption can vary geographically, seasonally, and with the amount of projected climate change. For the ESD method tested, the greatest challenges in downscaling daily maximum temperature projections are revealed to occur along coasts, in summer, and under conditions of greater projected warming. We conclude with a discussion of the potential use and expansion of the perfect model experimental design, both to inform the development of improved ESD methods and to provide guidance on the use of ESD products in climate impacts analyses and decision-support applications.","parentId":"5225464fe4b0e4746d62b021","linkParentIds":["505b2bfbe4b08c986b30c025"],"contacts":[{"name":"Springer Netherlands","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Keith W.

These issues are compounded by precipitation structures that are relatively shallow and experience growth at low levels due to orographic enhancement. To improve surface precipitation estimation, researchers at the University of Oklahoma have demonstrated the benefits of integrating the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) products into the ground-based NEXRAD rainfall estimation system using a vertical profile of reflectivity (VPR) identification and enhancement (VPR-IE) approach. However, the temporal resolution of TRMM limits the application of VPR-IE method operationally. To implement the VPR-IE concept into the National Mosaic and Multi-Sensor QPE (NMQ) system in real time, climatological VPRs from 11 years of TRMM PR observations have been characterized for different stratiform\/convective rain types, seasons, and surface rain intensities. Then, these representative profiles are used to adjust ground radar\u2013based precipitation estimates in the NMQ system based on different precipitation structures. This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the newly developed climatological VPR-IE (CVPR-IE) method on winter events (January, February, and December) in 2011. The statistical analysis reveals that the CVPR-IE method provides a clear improvement over the original radar QPE in the NMQ system for the study region. Compared to physically based VPRs from real-time PR measurements, climatological VPRs have limitations in representing precipitation structure for individual events. A hybrid correction scheme incorporating both climatological and real-time VPR information is desired for better skill in the future.","parentId":"5225474ae4b0e4746d62b02f","contacts":[{"name":"Yixin Wen","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Oklahoma"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Pierre Kirstetter","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Oklahoma"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Yang Hong","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Oklahoma"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jonathan J.

Objectives: To develop better predictive models of drought development and thereby increase the accuracy of fire weather forecasting we plan to determine: 1) the rates at which soils across the region gain and store heat as a consequence of rainfall patterns and magnitudes, 2) the extent to which fragmentation of the native landscape and current land uses differ in their heat load dynamics, 3) the regional contributions of land use type to drought development, and 4) how soil heat load dynamics contribute to the fire development under current fire weather criteria. Methods: Using data from the West Texas and Oklahoma MesoNets, we will analyze soil temperature and soil moisture dynamics within representative agroecosystems, grazing systems and native rangeland, and near urban areas during wet and dry years. We plan to determine: 1) the extent to which soil temperatures and soil moisture differ between land uses, 2) the response of soil heat-loads to the length of soil moisture windows, 3) the relationship between air and soil temperature under various land uses, and 4) establish the relationship between soil heat load dynamics, fire weather announcements and fire development. We can then develop a model that can predict the development of severe drought conditions (hence, fire risk) based upon projected air temperatures and precipitation. Expected Products & Information Transfer: We plan to 1) quantify the contribution of soil moisture and soil heat profiles to drought development and fire frequency under pronounced fire weather warnings during wet and dry years, 2) produce a \u201cdrought development score\u201d that establishes the potential of specific soil moisture and heat load conditions that induces region wide drought, 3) establish a regional map that links land use, soil type and potential for drought development , and 4) model responses of soil temperatures using regional models for predicted future air temperature. Dissemination of information will occur via scientific publications and data relevant for stakeholders and the general public (e.g. map on region-wide fire risk potential) on http:\/\/southcentralclimate.org\/ and on the MesnoNet sites. Personnel\/Cooperators\/Partners: We are partnered with: 1) Cotton Inc to examine soil temperature dynamics and soil heat-loading and patterns of soil moisture as they influence the sustainability of cotton production systems for West Texas, and 2) NOAA to understand how soil heat load patterns influence the probability of fire development under current fire weather conditions."},{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"FY 14 Grant","value":"G14AP00085"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":154078,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2014","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":78138},{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":75940}]}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/529d13d7e4b00602d02de1cb?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/529d13d7e4b00602d02de1cb?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=529d13d7e4b00602d02de1cb&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=529d13d7e4b00602d02de1cb&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=529d13d7e4b00602d02de1cb&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=529d13d7e4b00602d02de1cb","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/529d13d7e4b00602d02de1cb\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/529d13d7e4b00602d02de1cb","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"ExaminingSoilan.zip","files":""}],"csc":"South Central CSC","parent_id":"4f8c652fe4b0546c0c397b4a","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["John Zak","Natasja van Gestel","Renee McPherson","Todd Lindley","Bradley Illston"],"orgs":["South Central CSC"],"funding_years":"2014","fy":"2014"},"521cf689e4b01458f785804f":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"521cf689e4b01458f785804f","title":"Expanding a Standardized Framework for the Evaluation and Intercomparison of Statistically Downscaled Climate Projections","body":"This work seeks to improve the ability to generate climate change information that can be used by planners, policymakers, scientists, or the public to study the impacts of climate change at the local level (e. g. a town or a small geographic region). Developing relationships between observed weather elements (such as temperature or precipitation) and projections produced by computer climate models is one of the most common ways to generate this information. However, such an approach assumes that relationships derived during the past will be valid in the future, after climate has changed. Using conventional wisdom, one would have to wait decades to determine to what extent this assumption is valid. This research uses a novel approach in which researchers substitute certain climate model projections for future \"observations\" to test this assumption. Current findings suggest that the assumption does hold reasonably well in many cases, but there are instances (for example particular geographical locations, such as coastal regions, and times of year, especially summer) when this assumption is not as robust. This research further explores under what conditions the assumption degrades, and develops ways to make the methods that generate local information about climate change more reliable.","parentId":"52680a1ee4b0c24c90857576","contacts":[{"name":"John Lanzante","type":"Principal

availability gradient (precipitation range: 700 to 1800 mm\/year) and represents an excellent natural laboratory for developing climate-influenced ecological models for natural resource managers and culture keepers. In this project, we used this zone of remarkable transition to develop macroclimate-based models for quantifying the regional responses of coastal wetland ecosystems to climate variation. In addition to providing important fish and wildlife habitat and supporting coastal food webs, these coastal wetlands provide many ecosystem goods and services including clean water, stable coastlines, food, recreational opportunities, and stored carbon. Our objective was to examine and forecast the effects of macroclimatic drivers on wetland ecosystem structure and function in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Our first major step in meeting this overall objective was to develop a quantitative understanding of the connections between climate and ecosystem structure. We then incorporated the resulting information into quantitative vulnerability assessments that examine sensitivity (via observed data), exposure (via alternative future climate scenarios), and adaptive capacity (via life history literature). In the process, we identified regional climate-ecological thresholds for coastal wetland ecosystems. Our study focused on coastal wetland variations across relatively dramatic precipitation and temperature gradients in the northern Gulf of Mexico and included study areas in TX, LA, MS, AL, and FL. The project provided valuable experience and opportunities for five early-career researchers (one post-doctoral fellow, two current or recent undergraduate students, and two early-career research scientists).&nbsp;","parentId":"52254414e4b0e4746d62aff7","contacts":[{"name":"Michael J Osland","oldPartyId":57822,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"mosland@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J","lastName":"Osland","organization":{"displayText":"National Wetlands Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"3372668664","streetAddress":{"zip":"70506","city":"Lafayette","state":"LA","line1":"700 Cajundome Blvd"},"buildingCode":"KFA","name":"Michael J Osland\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"70506","country":"USA","city":"Lafayette","state":"LA","line1":"700 Cajundome Blvd."},"building":"WARC - Office\/LAb Building"}},{"name":"South Central CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","active":true,"aliases":["SCCSC","South Central CSC"],"fbmsCodes":["GGHCEN0506"],"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"South Central Climate Science Center - Location","mailAddress":[]}}],"tags":[{"name":"climate change "},{"name":"Coastal Wetlands"},{"name":"Microclimate"}],"dates":[{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2016-01-22","label":"Date Reported"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-04-06T06:57:24.541-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-04-13T07:25:53.303-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":191470,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-04-13T13:25:04.000Z","name":"Final Project Memo-Ecological implications climate change wetlands.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__b5\/98\/af\/b598afa9fca593948fe2f1a85bd49cb4d087fa17","title":" Final Project Memo- Establishing a Foundation for Evaluating the Ecological Imp","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/570507b4e4b0d4e2b7568467?f=__disk__b5%2F98%2Faf%2Fb598afa9fca593948fe2f1a85bd49cb4d087fa17"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/570507b4e4b0d4e2b7568467","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalProjectMem.zip","files":""}],"csc":"South Central CSC","parent_id":"4f8c652fe4b0546c0c397b4a","people":["Michael J Osland"],"orgs":["South Central CSC"]},"57583cfee4b04f417c251ff4":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/521cf637e4b01458f785800b","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Final Report - Regional Graduate Student, Post-Doc, and Early Career Researcher Workshop","relatedTitle":"Regional Graduate Student, Post-Doc, and Early Career Researcher Workshop","id":"57583cfee4b04f417c251ff4","relatedId":"521cf637e4b01458f785800b","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/57583cfee4b04f417c251ff4","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Regional Graduate Student, Post-Doc, and Early Career Researcher Workshop","relatedTitle":"Final Report - Regional Graduate Student, Post-Doc, and Early Career Researcher Workshop","id":"521cf637e4b01458f785800b","relatedId":"57583cfee4b04f417c251ff4","annotation":null}]},"id":"57583cfee4b04f417c251ff4","title":"Final Report - Regional Graduate Student, Post-Doc, and Early Career Researcher Workshop","body":"Led by members of the South Central Climate Science Center (SC CSC) consortium, this project developed and implemented a professional development workshop for graduate students, post-docs, and early-career researchers within the SC CSC region. The workshop (1) introduced participants to the goals, structure, and unique research-related challenges of the SC CSC and its place within the U.S. Department of the Interior and the larger CSC network, offering them insight into how their research fits into the broader research priority goals and its eventual applicability to end-user needs across the region; (2) provided an opportunity for participants to present their research to fellow peers; (3) facilitated interdisciplinary interactions between participants within the SC CSC purview in an effort to foster collaborative opportunities; and (4) generated a set of digitally recorded presentations on the SC CSC enterprise and a \u201chow to\u201d guide for conducting a similar workshop in other CSC regions. A major benefit of this project was the development of a cohort of early-career professionals who can continue networking through their research pathways and who can understand and eventually lead outcome-oriented, interdisciplinary research.

Scientists, water managers and other stakeholders are interested in knowing what is in store for the future of the Red River Basin. Researchers at the University of Oklahoma and the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations developed projections of future hydrology for the Red River Basin under possible future climate conditions. A methodology was developed for using current state of the art Global Climate Models (GCM) and applying them on a scale suitable for hydrologic models, ultimately making the information useful to water managers and interested stakeholders. We conclude that there are considerable differences between the various models generated and that many other sources of uncertainty exist when using that information for water management decisions. However, the following general conclusions can be made: (1) Precipitation: Most models predict slightly less precipitation in the western portions of the basin and more in the east in the future. This is particularly true for the MPI-ESM-LR GCM, however it is not the case for all simulations and making a generalized statement about future precipitation would be inadvisable. Increased evaporation somewhat negates this effect when analyzing future flows; (2) Temperature: It will be warmer in the future, with the magnitude of the temperature increase largely dictated by the amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere in the future. In fact, under the worst case scenarios, average temperatures could increase by as much as 6 o C (11 o F). Daily minimum temperatures are expected to increase more than daily maximum; (3) Hydrology: While some of the models predict similar or more streamflow in the future, especially in the eastern portions of the Red River Basin, this is not a universal conclusion. In fact some of the models under higher emission scenarios predict significantly less flow in the western reaches in the future. There is a strong possibility that future droughts will be longer and deeper across the entire basin, while floods may be more intense.","parentId":"5225474ae4b0e4746d62b02f","contacts":[{"name":"Wayne Kellogg","oldPartyId":64940,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"Wayne.kellogg@chickasaw.net","active":true,"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Kellogg","organization":{"displayText":"Chicksaw Nation"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"South Central CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","active":true,"aliases":["SCCSC","South Central CSC"],"fbmsCodes":["GGHCEN0506"],"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"name":"South Central Climate Science Center - Location","mailAddress":[]}}],"tags":[{"name":"Hydrology"},{"name":"Red River"},{"name":"Climate change"}],"dates":[{"type":"Reported","dateString":"2016-02-01","label":"Date Reported"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-04-06T06:22:02.491-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-04-13T07:26:30.950-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"files":[{"originalMetadata":false,"processed":false,"size":5209927,"useForPreview":false,"dateUploaded":"2016-04-06T12:21:07.000Z","name":"RedRiverClimateChange_FinalReport.pdf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__f5\/46\/3d\/f5463d56d15e1b17aa263276d955ff9d329f40d8","title":"Final Report- Impacts of climate change on flows in the Red River Basin","contentType":"application\/pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5704ff6ae4b0d4e2b7567b18?f=__disk__f5%2F46%2F3d%2Ff5463d56d15e1b17aa263276d955ff9d329f40d8"}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5704ff6ae4b0d4e2b7567b18","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"FinalReport_Imp.zip","files":""}],"csc":"South Central CSC","parent_id":"4f8c652fe4b0546c0c397b4a","people":["Wayne Kellogg"],"orgs":["South Central CSC"]},"537b19d1e4b0929ba496ab2b":{"relationships":{"total":4,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/521cf699e4b01458f785805c","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Freshwater availability and coastal wetland foundation species: ecological transitions along a rainfall gradient","relatedTitle":"Establishing a Foundation for Evaluating the Ecological Implications of Climate Change along a Gradient in Macroclimatic Drivers of Coastal Wetland Ecosystems","id":"537b19d1e4b0929ba496ab2b","relatedId":"521cf699e4b01458f785805c","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5016c89be4b06fb5ce8b736a","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Freshwater availability and coastal wetland foundation species: ecological transitions along a rainfall gradient","relatedTitle":"Ecological Implications of Mangrove Forest Migration in the Southeastern U.S.","id":"537b19d1e4b0929ba496ab2b","relatedId":"5016c89be4b06fb5ce8b736a","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/537b19d1e4b0929ba496ab2b","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Establishing a Foundation for Evaluating the Ecological Implications of Climate Change along a Gradient in Macroclimatic Drivers of Coastal Wetland Ecosystems","relatedTitle":"Freshwater availability and coastal wetland foundation species: ecological transitions along a rainfall gradient","id":"521cf699e4b01458f785805c","relatedId":"537b19d1e4b0929ba496ab2b","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/537b19d1e4b0929ba496ab2b","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Ecological Implications of Mangrove Forest Migration in the Southeastern U.S.","relatedTitle":"Freshwater availability and coastal wetland foundation species: ecological transitions along a rainfall gradient","id":"5016c89be4b06fb5ce8b736a","relatedId":"537b19d1e4b0929ba496ab2b","annotation":null}]},"id":"537b19d1e4b0929ba496ab2b","title":"Freshwater availability and coastal wetland foundation species: ecological transitions along a rainfall gradient","body":"Climate gradient-focused ecological research can provide a foundation for better understanding critical ecological transition points and nonlinear climate-ecological relationships, which is information that can be used to better understand, predict, and manage ecological responses to climate change. In this study, we examined the influence of freshwater availability upon the coverage of foundation plant species in coastal wetlands along a northwestern Gulf of Mexico rainfall gradient. Our research addresses the following three questions: (1) what are the region-scale relationships between measures of freshwater availability (e.g., rainfall, aridity, freshwater inflow, salinity) and the relative abundance of foundation plant species in tidal wetlands; (2) How vulnerable are foundation plant species in tidal wetlands to future changes in freshwater availability; and (3) What is the potential future relative abundance of tidal wetland foundation plant species under alternative climate change scenarios? We developed simple freshwater availability-based models to predict the relative abundance (i.e., coverage) of tidal wetland foundation plant species using climate data (1970-2000), estuarine freshwater inflow-focused data, and coastal wetland habitat data. Our results identify regional ecological thresholds and nonlinear relationships between measures of freshwater availability and the relative abundance of foundation plant species in tidal wetlands. In drier coastal zones, relatively small changes in rainfall could produce comparatively large landscape-scale changes in foundation plant species abundance which would affect some ecosystem good and services. Whereas a drier future would result in a decrease in the coverage of foundation plant species, a wetter future would result in an increase in foundation plant species coverage. In many ways, the freshwater-dependent coastal wetland ecological transitions we observed are analogous to those present in dryland terrestrial ecosystems.","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["505b584fe4b08c986b30c22f","52254414e4b0e4746d62aff7"],"contacts":[{"name":"Michael J.

Edwards aquifer sites include Barton Springs, the Bexar County Index Well, and Comal Springs. Madison aquifer sites include Spearfish Creek and Rhoads Fork Spring. Climate projections at sites were based on output from the Community Climate System Model of global climate, linked to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model of regional climate. The WRF model output was bias adjusted to match means for 1981\u20132010 from records at weather stations near Madison and Edwards aquifer sites, including Boerne, Texas, and Custer and Lead, South Dakota. Hydrologic response at spring and well sites was based on the Rainfall-Response Aquifer and Watershed Flow (RRAWFLOW) model. The WRF model climate projections for 2011\u201350 indicate a significant upward trend in annual air temperature for all three weather stations and a significant downward trend in annual precipitation for the Boerne weather station. Annual springflow simulated by the RRAWFLOW model had a significant downward trend for Edwards aquifer sites and no trend for Madison aquifer sites.<\/p>\n<p>Flora and fauna that rely on springflow from Edwards and Madison aquifer sites were assessed for vulnerability to projected climate change on the basis of the Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI). The CCVI is determined by the exposure of a species to climate, the sensitivity of the species, and the ability of the species to cope with climate change. Sixteen species associated with springs and groundwater were assessed in the Balcones Escarpment region. The Barton Springs salamander (<i>Eurycea sosorum<\/i>) was scored as highly vulnerable with moderate confidence. Nine species\u2014three salamanders, a fountain darter (<i>Etheostoma fonticola<\/i>), three insects, and two amphipods\u2014were scored as moderately vulnerable. The remaining six species\u2014four vascular plants, the Barton cavesnail (<i>Stygopyrgus bartonensis<\/i>), and a cave shrimp\u2014were scored as not vulnerable\/presumed stable (not vulnerable and evidence does not support change in abundance or range of the species). Vulnerability of eight species associated with streams that receive springflow from the Madison aquifer in the Black Hills was assessed. Of these, the American dipper (<i>Cinclus mexicanus<\/i>) and the lesser yellow lady\u2019s slipper (<i>Cypripedium parviflorum<\/i>) were scored as moderately vulernable with high confidence. The dwarf scouringrush (<i>Equisetum scirpoides<\/i>) and autumn willow (<i>Salix serissima<\/i>) were also scored as moderately vulnerable with moderate to low confidence, respectively. Other species were assessed as not vulnerable\/presumed stable or not vulnerable\/increase likely (not vulnerable and evidence supporting an increase in abundance or range of the species). Lower vulnerability scores for the Black Hills species in comparison to the Balcones Escarpment species reflect lower endemicity, higher projected springflow than in the historical period, and high thermal tolerance of many of the species for the Black Hills. Importantly, climate change vulnerability scores differed substantially for Edwards aquifer species when RRAWFLOW model projections were included, resulting in increased vulnerability scores for 12 of the 16 species.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["52d563cbe4b0f19e63da8658"],"contacts":[{"name":"John F.

We synthesize existing paleoclimate proxy data and climate simulations to provide an overview of climate variability in Texas during the Holocene. Conditions became progressively warmer and drier transitioning from the early to mid Holocene, culminating between 7 and 3 ka (thousand years ago), and were more variable during the late Holocene. The timing and relative magnitude of Holocene climate variability, however, is poorly constrained owing to considerable variability among the different records. To help address this, we present a new speleothem (NBJ) reconstruction from a central Texas cave that comprises the highest resolution proxy record to date, spanning the mid to late Holocene. NBJ trace-element concentrations indicate variable moisture conditions with no clear temporal trend. There is a decoupling between NBJ growth rate, trace-element concentrations, and \u03b418O values, which indicate that (i) the often direct relation between speleothem growth rate and moisture availability is likely complicated by changes in the overlying ecosystem that affect subsurface CO2 production, and (ii) speleothem \u03b418O variations likely reflect changes in moisture source (i.e., proportion of Pacific-vs. Gulf of Mexico-derived moisture) that appear not to be linked to moisture amount.","parentId":"52d563cbe4b0f19e63da8658","contacts":[{"name":"Corinne I.

Researchers at Texas Tech University found that lower daily temperature ranges of soil in the Southern High Plains were associated with higher levels of soil microbes (which help make critical nutrients available for plants) and decreased nitrogen availability. These results suggest that climate variability may have implications for soil health and microbial content. In the South Central U.S., a more developed understanding of how management practices, climate variability, and soil health interact is essential for sound agricultural decision-making.<br>\n<br>\nThis project will implement demonstration fields in which various sustainable management practices can be tested and their impacts on soil temperature and health can be monitored. The demonstration fields will focus on cotton production and will test management practices related to water use efficiency, carbon storage, and soil health. In addition to demonstrating the effects of various management practices, these plots will help to determine how much variability cotton production systems can tolerate before ecosystems and the services they provide are negatively affected.<br>\n<br>\nThis demonstration system is in high demand amongst regional stakeholders and will be implemented with the support of the South\u2010Central USDA Climate Hub, NRCS scientists, and Cotton Inc.

Participants will also understand the data sources available to them.\n\nPhysical Vulnerability: Participants will determine the physical components within a community, particularly critical facilities and lifelines.\n\nSocial Vulnerability: Participants will investigate an often neglected component of community vulnerability: social vulnerability. Facilitators will describe the current research on social vulnerability and will describe the demographic characteristics which may hinder a populations\u2019 ability to anticipate, respond to, and cope with a disaster.\n\nAsset Mapping: Based on the three previous \u2018pre-impact conditions\u2019 assessments, participants will discover elements within the community that can act as particular assets upon disaster impact.\n\nTechnical Needs: Facilitators will provide specific tools community leaders can use to assess vulnerability. Accessing refined data on your community is an important component in developing an overall vulnerability assessment (i.e. American Community Survey, web-based mapping tools, etc.).","parentId":"5318d138e4b0ae6e9d5a3c40","contacts":[{"name":"Dawn Jourdan","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"dawnjourdan@ou.edu","organization":{"displayText":"Division of Regional & City Planning, College of Architecture, University of Oklahoma"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"4053347164","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"73019-6141","country":"USA","city":"Norman","state":"OK","line1":"830 Van Vleet Oval Gould Hall, Room 256"}}},{"name":"John Harris","type":"Co-Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"johncharris@ou.edu","organization":{"displayText":"Division of Regional and City Planning, University of Oklahoma"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"null","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"null","state":"null","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"South Central CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Community","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Organization","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"South Central CSC"},{"type":"Fiscal Year","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"vulnerability assessment"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"extreme weather events"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"climate change"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"disaster preparedness"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"planning"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"tribal nations"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-08-01","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2015-07-31","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2014-10-07T10:19:36.541-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-12-01T14:06:20.918-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"Completed","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"Technical Summary","value":"Background\r\nTribal leaders within the region of the South Central Climate Science Center are faced with meeting all federal requirements to qualify for disaster relief assistance.  A part of this requirement is conducting a full hazard vulnerability assessment. A vulnerability assessment training program is needed to identify the potential strengths and weaknesses in the event of disaster impact. A vulnerability assessment asks: What types of hazards is your community faced with? What structures and infrastructure are at risk? Who in your community is likely to experience physical and\/or social impacts?\r\n\r\nThe University of Oklahoma\u2019s Division of Regional and City Planning, together with partners from the Hazard Reduction and Recovery Center (HRRC) at Texas A&M University,  seeks to engage tribal leaders and OU research in a training opportunity centered on the topic of vulnerability assessment.  The HRRC was established as an interdisciplinary research center in 1988. One of only two United Nations (UN-OCHA) Collaborative Centers in the world, the HRRC strives \u201cto provide assistance and consultation to state, national and international agencies charged with responsibility for hazard analysis, emergency preparedness and response, disaster recovery, and hazard mitigation.\u201d Since 2011, the HRRC has developed a full set of curriculum and has trained professionals across the country on vulnerability assessments.  The following describes a training program that would facilitate the fulfillment of federal requirements with respect for tribes seeking to qualify for disaster relief assistance.  \r\n\r\nTraining Plan  \r\nThe following describes the general approach and timeline to conducting the training program. \r\n\r\nApril 2014. RCPL faculty will conduct a series of interviews to tribal representatives from the Citizen Potawatomie, Chickasaw, Absentee Shawnee, Ponca, to gage the full breadth of issues the community finds pertinent to assessing vulnerability. Interviewees would provide a prioritized list of training needs. Needs may include, expanded clarification on specific topics, technical skills assistance, etc. The RCPL faculty will deliver this information to its HRRC partners for preparation of the May workshop on or before April 30, 2014.\r\n\r\nLate May 2014. The HRRC will prepare a one day workshop based on the information solicited by the RCPL faculty for delivery to tribal representatives, university researchers, and LCC participants at the end of May or in early June, as is most convenient for the participants. The workshop would delve into specific needs associated with conducting a vulnerability assessment that is culturally appropriate and mindful of the past to chart a course for the future. Workshops would include lectures, presentations, activities, and interactive exercises. The workshop will be held on OU\u2019s campus at the South Central Climate Science Center.  The SC-CSC has resources available that will engage the 64 sovereign tribal nations in the South central region, particularly in reviewing the materials and resources for tribally relevant information, finding appropriate workshop locations, and inviting outstanding tribal environmental professionals and managers who will be leaders and participate in the workshops.\r\n\r\nNext Steps\r\nBy the end of this course, participants will be able to thoughtfully determine hazard exposures, physical vulnerabilities, and social vulnerabilities and will understand that by prioritizing vulnerable areas, communities can inject essential support and resources most efficiently. Also, participants will determine the variety of assets within their community and overall, will think more holistically about planning for their community to ultimately become more resilient to disaster impacts. This community planning approach, mindful of tribal traditions, will help train community leaders plan and prepare for natural or technological hazards. Subsequent to the completion of the workshop, RCPL faculty will work with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and tribal partners to secure funding to conduct vulnerability assessments for interested tribes.   \r\n"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":21466,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2014","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":21466}]}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/54341298e4b095098ca896e8?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/54341298e4b095098ca896e8?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=54341298e4b095098ca896e8&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=54341298e4b095098ca896e8&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=54341298e4b095098ca896e8&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=54341298e4b095098ca896e8","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/54341298e4b095098ca896e8\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/54341298e4b095098ca896e8","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"IdentifyingTrib.zip","files":""}],"csc":"South Central CSC","parent_id":"4f8c652fe4b0546c0c397b4a","projectStatus":"Completed","people":["Dawn Jourdan","John Harris"],"orgs":["South Central CSC"],"funding_years":"2014","fy":"2014"},"521cf67ce4b01458f7858040":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"521cf67ce4b01458f7858040","title":"Impacts of Climate Change on Flows in the Red River Basin","body":"<div>\n The Red River Basin is a vital source of water in the South Central U.S., supporting ecosystems, drinking water, agriculture, tourism and recreation, and cultural ceremonies. Stretching from the High Plains of New Mexico eastward to the Mississippi River, the Red River Basin encompasses parts of five states \u2013 New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana. Further, 74% of the jurisdictional boundaries of the Chickasaw and Choctaw Tribes are located within the basin.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> Water resources in the basin have been stressed in recent years due to a multi-year drought and increasing demands for consumptive use by metropolitan areas in Oklahoma and Texas. Unfortunately, currently available projections of future precipitation across the region show a high degree of uncertainty, making it difficult for water managers to plan for the future.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> The goal of this project is to provide resource managers with critical information on the impacts of climate change on flow in the Red River Basin. Researchers (1) used global climate models to make climate projections for the basin, and (2) developed models to determine the impacts of projected future climate conditions on stream flow. The modeling results can be used to evaluate future water supplies for water providers and flows for the environment.\n <br> &nbsp;\n <br> The Red River Basin lies within the boundaries of three Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs), and the results of this project will help the LCCs and other managers reduce the impacts of floods and droughts and make decisions regarding the potential need for additional reservoirs or diversions of water into the Red River Basin.

It receives an average annual precipitation of 14 inches per year in its headwaters to greater than 60 inches per year where it flows into the Mississippi River. The basin lies within the boundaries of three Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs). Determining the impact of climate change on the flows of the Red River and its tributaries is essential for water management and water supply planning. Major metropolitan areas in Oklahoma and North Texas are looking at the Red River basin for their future water supplies. This study will involve the use of downscaled global climate models, the development of a distributed rainfall--\u2010runoff models (VIC), as well as a channel routing water management tool (RiverWare). Integrating this suite of models will improve water management decisions. These tools will reduce the impacts of floods and droughts, and inform decision--\u2010makers regarding the need for additional impoundments or inter--\u2010basin transfer. The tools developed for this study also can be used to evaluate the impacts of low flows on aquatic life or evaluate water quality at different flow conditions.","parentId":"52680a1ee4b0c24c90857576","contacts":[{"name":"Wayne Kellogg","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"wayne.kellogg@chickasaw.net","organization":{"displayText":"Chickasaw Nation"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"(580) 272-5076","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"74820","country":"null","city":"Ada","state":"OK","line1":"1630 E.

This project proposes development of a spatial decision support system (DSS) to assist the LCC community and partner resource management agencies across the MRB in addressing these issues. The DSS will be designed to identify select geographic areas (watersheds) within the MRB where application of conservation practices can simultaneously (1) reduce nutrient export to the Gulf hypoxia zone and (2) enhance habitat and conservation for grassland and riparian bird species, based on identifying (3) landowners who are willing and capable of effectively implementing these practices. The DSS will be used to identify appropriate conservation practices to be implemented and to quantify resulting benefits for both nutrient export and riparian\/grassland birds. The DSS will also enable analyses of whether landowner willingness to implement desired practices is affected by perceptions of future climate extremes. Background: This project has support and includes contributions and collaboration from LCCs and participating agencies throughout the MRB, including federal and state conservation agencies, NGOs, and universities. The project, a pilot for a larger future effort, seeks to help move current opportunistic conservation approaches to a more strategic level by locating projects in critical watersheds to achieve the greatest overall conservation benefit. While significant research is currently invested in decision support tools for designing alternatives for future adaptation of policies and management strategies for responding to climate change and extremes, limited research exists that improves understanding of how learning, attitudes and decision making by land owners and managers shape adaptation and resilient livelihoods beyond climate risks. This project will significantly improve understanding of what motivates landowners to adopt conservation practices, filling what is presently a critical information gap. Procedures\/Methods: One component of the project involves development and application of the structure and components of the DSS itself. This will involve identifying a suite of focal watersheds for DSS applications in 3-4 regions of the MRB, based on criteria provided by LCC staff and other resource managers, as well as developing a set of four sub-models that comprise the DSS: (1) a species habitat sub-model for grassland and riparian bird species of concern, (2) a surface hydrology sub-model, (3) a best management practices (BMP) sub-model based on a subset of NRCS BMPs, and (4) a sub-model reflecting information on the locations of landowners who are willing and capable implementing desired BMPs, and how their preferences for applying conservation practices on the ground might change based on perceptions of future climate extremes. The second project component involves linking or interfacing the newly developed DSS with WRESTORE, an existing interactive and participatory modeling framework developed for designing alternatives of conservation practices via web-based interaction with stakeholder communities. This will be useful for fine tuning or refining output from the new DSS to design spatial plans for locating conservation practices in watersheds of interest. The third project component will involve detailed on-site surveys of land owners and managers in carefully selected watersheds. The intent is to significantly improve current understanding of what motivates landowners to adopt specific conservation practices, and how their motivation and preference might change in the face of extreme climate events. This information will inform design of the fourth sub-model in the DSS. Products and Information Transfer: Products will include the DSS application and underlying source code, data sets that underpin the DSS with reference to its application to focal MRB watersheds, data and maps resulting from DSS applications, results of landowner surveys and their interpretation, and related information. This array of project results and information will be of interest to 7 LCCs, state and federal land and resource management agencies, and NGOs in the MRB. Hence, we will employ various methods to disseminate information to the expected user community. We will publish results in technical reports and scientific publications, and present and discuss results as well as DSS applications at meetings with LCC staff and resource managers. We will serve the main results online (hosted by UMESC and\/or ETPBR LCC), including the DSS application and source code, a web application that provides access to maps of DSS output. <\/div>","parentId":"53173f66e4b0cd4cd83be25c","linkParentIds":["5318d138e4b0ae6e9d5a3c40"],"contacts":[{"name":"Jack Waide","oldPartyId":10834,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"waidej@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Supervisory Ecologist","personalTitle":"Mr.","firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Waide","cellPhone":"6083859354","organization":{"displayText":"Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"6087836066","officePhone":"6087816269","streetAddress":{"zip":"54603","country":"US","city":"La Crosse","state":"WI","line1":"2630 Fanta Reed Road"},"buildingCode":"ARF","name":"Jack Waide\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"54603","country":"USA","mailStopCode":"301","city":"La Crosse","state":"WI","line1":"2630 Fanta Reed Road"},"building":"UMESC"}},{"name":"Jason Rohweder","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"jrohweder@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"6087816228","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"54603","country":"USA","city":"La Crosse","state":"WI","line1":"2630 Fanta Reed Road"}}},{"name":"Timothy Fox","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"tfox@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"USGS UMESC"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"null","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"null","state":"null","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"Linda Prokopy","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"lprokopy@usgs.gov","organization":{"displayText":"Purdue University"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"null","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"null","state":"null","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"Meghna Babbar-Sebens","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","email":"mbabbar@gmail.com","organization":{"displayText":"Oregon State University"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"null","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"null","country":"null","city":"null","state":"null","line1":"null"}}},{"name":"Northeast CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Gwen White","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"Eastern Tallgrass Prairie & Big Rivers Landscape Conservation Cooperative"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"South Central CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"browseCategories":["Project"],"browseTypes":["Map Service","OGC WMS Service","OGC WFS Layer","OGC WMS Layer"],"systemTypes":["Folder"],"tags":[{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"Northeast CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2014"},{"name":"Gulf Hypoxia"},{"name":"Bird Conservation"},{"name":"Decision Support System"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2014-05-28","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2016-05-28","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2013-12-03T12:09:09.876-07:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-23T10:16:16.619-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","parts":[{"_class":"ProjectPart","type":"General Public Summary","value":"USFWS Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) throughout the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) have identified high nutrient runoff, a major contributor to Gulf hypoxia, and declines in wildlife populations (especially grassland and riparian birds), as conservation challenges requiring collaborative action.

But communicating key concepts such as risk and vulnerability is a culturally specific practice. So these new relationships call for pluricultural conversations about climate change and variability. To contribute to the goal of mutual understanding, this project developed and implemented a series of five workshops - four in Oklahoma and one in New Mexico - that introduced Tribal members and employees across the region to the SC CSC as a resource for their climate adaptation practices. Not counting members of the research team, 76 individuals participated in the workshops and 66 of them identified with 33 different Tribes. During and in relation to the workshops, the two Indigenous filmmakers on the research team interviewed 49 people. They incorporated this and related footage into a video titled Listening for the Rain: Indigenous Peoples Perspectives on Climate Change. Their 22.5-minute video documents climate impacts on Tribal nations and their Peoples, lands, resources, and economies in the central US. Blending educational outreach with research on how Tribal members know and conceptualize weather and climate, as well as historically grappled with adapting to new climate conditions, Listening for the Rain provides lessons about adaptation that are useful for both Tribal and non-Tribal communities and businesses. Its production and subsequent circulation on the Internet, at conferences, and by DVD, has prompted valuable dialogue that furthers previous relationships among Tribal and research communities while also fostering new ones.","parentId":"5006f8b9e4b0abf7ce733fc0","contacts":[{"name":"Dr. Laurel Smith","type":"Principal Investigator","email":"laurel@ou.edu","organization":{"displayText":"University

Final Report","body":"The establishment of the South Central Climate Science Center (SCCSC) heralded new forms of partnership among Tribal nations and members of the climate science and conservation communities. But communicating key concepts such as risk and vulnerability is a culturally specific practice. So these new relationships call for pluricultural conversations about climate change and variability. To contribute to the goal of mutual understanding, this project developed and implemented a series of five workshops -- four in Oklahoma and one in New Mexico -- that introduced Tribal members and employees across the region to the SC CSC as a resource for their climate adaptation practices. Not counting members of the research team, 76 individuals participated in the workshops and 66 of them identified with 33 different Tribes. During and in relation to the workshops, the two Indigenous filmmakers on the research team interviewed 49 people. They incorporated this and related footage into a video titled \n<em>Listening for the Rain: Indigenous Peoples Perspectives on Climate Change<\/em>. Their 22.5-minute video documents climate impacts on Tribal nations and their Peoples, lands, resources, and economies in the Central U.S.A. Blending educational outreach with research on how Tribal members know and conceptualize weather and climate, as well as historically grappled with adapting to new climate conditions, \n<em>Listening for the Rain<\/em> provides lessons about adaptation that are useful for both Tribal and non-Tribal communities and businesses. Its production and subsequent circulation on the Internet, at conferences, and by DVD, has prompted valuable dialogue that furthers previous relationships among Tribal and research communities while also fostering new ones.","parentId":"505b2fe4e4b08c986b30c035","contacts":[{"name":"Laurel C.

Karst aquifers are uniquely suited for investigating effects of climate variability at timescales of human interest because they are highly dynamic; further, many provide habitat for rare and endangered species. The principal objective of this project was to determine how interrelations between karst hydrology and ecosystems will be affected by climate change. &nbsp;\n<br> \n<br> Current relations between recharge (impulse) and storage and spring flow (response) are quantified through signal-processing models that use existing time series of precipitation, stream flow, water level, and spring flow. Future changes in storage and spring flow are forecast by linking the signal-processing models with a downscaled climate change model. Current and future ecosystem health is assessed by assembling and analyzing spatial and temporal data in the two focal karst ecosystems and assessing their vulnerability related to projected climate change on the basis of the Climate-Change Vulnerability Index.","parentId":"5006f8b9e4b0abf7ce733fc0","contacts":[{"name":"Barbara J Mahler","oldPartyId":6420,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"bjmahler@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Hydrologist","firstName":"Barbara","middleName":"J","lastName":"Mahler","organization":{"displayText":"Texas Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"5129273590","officePhone":"5129273566","streetAddress":{"zip":"78754","city":"Austin","state":"TX","line1":"1505 Ferguson Lane"},"buildingCode":"KIA","name":"Barbara J Mahler\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI -

By linking a global climate, regional climate, and hydrologic model, researchers can obtain input for a tool to measure species vulnerability. Modifying the tool to explicitly incorporate hydrologic factors such as spring flow and water-table level brings us a step closer to a more realistic assessment of species vulnerability in karst settings.<\/p>\n\n<p>This research initiative is supported by the South Central Climate Science Center through the project,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/display-project\/4f8c652fe4b0546c0c397b4a\/52d5615ae4b0f19e63da8647\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background: transparent; color: rgb(49, 133, 156) !important;\">Karst and Climate Change: Understanding Linkages Between Climate, Water Resources, and Ecosystems<\/a>.<\/p>\n","parentId":"52d563dde4b0f19e63da865c","contacts":[{"name":"Barbara J Mahler","oldPartyId":6420,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"bjmahler@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Hydrologist","firstName":"Barbara","middleName":"J","lastName":"Mahler","organization":{"displayText":"Texas Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"5129273590","officePhone":"5129273566","streetAddress":{"zip":"78754","city":"Austin","state":"TX","line1":"1505 Ferguson Lane"},"buildingCode":"KIA","name":"Barbara J Mahler\/WRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"78754-4501","country":"USA","city":"Austin","state":"TX","line1":"1505 Ferguson Lane"},"building":"Texas Water Science Center - Austin"}},{"name":"South Central CSC","type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}}],"webLinks":[{"type":"webLink","typeLabel":"Web Link","uri":"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/webinar\/karstandclimatechange","rel":"related","title":"Webinar, October 25, 2016","hidden":false}],"tags":[{"name":"Karst"},{"name":"Salamanders"},{"name":"water flow"},{"name":"aquifers"}],"dates":[{"type":"Publication","dateString":"2016-10-25","label":"Publication Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2016-11-03T13:22:26.381-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2016-11-03T13:22:26.381-06:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"distributionLinks":[],"csc":"South Central CSC","parent_id":"4f8c652fe4b0546c0c397b4a","people":["Barbara J Mahler"],"orgs":["South Central CSC"]},"531f2a70e4b0193009ddecfa":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5012e251e4b05140039e03d1","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Listening for the Rain","relatedTitle":"Inter-Tribal Workshops on Climate Change in the Central U.S.","id":"531f2a70e4b0193009ddecfa","relatedId":"5012e251e4b05140039e03d1","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/531f2a70e4b0193009ddecfa","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Inter-Tribal Workshops on Climate Change in the Central U.S.","relatedTitle":"Listening for the Rain","id":"5012e251e4b05140039e03d1","relatedId":"531f2a70e4b0193009ddecfa","annotation":null}]},"id":"531f2a70e4b0193009ddecfa","title":"Listening for the Rain","body":"Listening for the Rain starts a pluricultural conversation in which some Indigenous people who live in the central United States of America discuss their observations and understandings of, as well as responses to, climate change and variability.

The final classification is a 10-meter raster dataset that was produced by using a majority filter to classify image objects according to the marsh vegetation type covering the majority of each image object.

cascading calibration (MSCC) approach using the shuffled complex evolution\u2013University of Arizona (SCE-UA) optimization method, developed at the University of Arizona, was employed to calibrate the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model in the Red River Basin. Model simulations were conducted at 35 nested gauging stations. Compared with simulated results using a priori parameters, single-site calibration can improve VIC model performance at specific calibration sites; however, improvement is still limited in upstream locations. The newly developed MSCC approach overcomes this limitation. Simulations using MSCC not only utilize all of the available streamflow observations but also better represent spatial heterogeneities in the model parameters. Results indicate that MSCC largely improves model performance by decreasing the number of stations with negative Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSCE) values from 69% (66%) for a priori parameters to 37% (34%) for single-site calibration to 3% (3%) for MSCC, and by increasing the number of stations with NSCE values larger than 0.5 from 9% (9%), to 23% (23%) to 34% (29%) during calibration (and validation) periods across all sites.","parentId":"5225474ae4b0e4746d62b02f","contacts":[{"name":"Xianwu Xue","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Oklahoma"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Ke Zhang","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Oklahoma"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Yang Hong","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Oklahoma"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Jonathan J.

Despite their critical importance, and their global decline, the scientific community lacks consistent baseline data on SAV resources across the gradient from fresh to brackish (slightly salty) to salt water. This project will 1) provide data on the occurrence and abundance of SAV (e.g., coverage, composition, seed resources) within the northern Gulf of Mexico, 2) quantitatively assess environmental factors affecting its variation across space and time, and 3) develop a conceptual model of factors influencing SAV resources. These data are critical in identifying numerical relationships between SAV resources and environmental variables, and will enable predictive modeling of SAV resources under different scenarios of landscape and climate change. This work will contribute to the refinement of existing models of ecosystem change and directly benefit efforts to forecast the effects of climate change on distribution, abundance, and diversity of SAV resources and the priority fish and wildlife populations that depend upon them.<\/p>","parentId":"5006f8b9e4b0abf7ce733fc0","linkParentIds":["50caedcbe4b09e092d6eeef4","511266b3e4b0ebe69d7eb77f"],"contacts":[{"name":"Megan La Peyre","type":"Principal Investigator","email":"mlapey@lsu.edu","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Louisiana Fish and Wildlife Cooperative Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"225-578-4180"}},{"name":"Andy Nyman","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","organization":{"displayText":"Louisiana State University Agricultural Center"}},{"name":"Mike Poirrier","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","organization":{"displayText":"University of New Orleans"}},{"name":"Brady Couvillion","oldPartyId":2115,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"USGS, National Wetlands Research Center"}},{"name":"Joy Merino","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","organization":{"displayText":"National Marine Fisheries Service"}},{"name":"Mike Brasher","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","organization":{"displayText":"Ducks Unlimited and Gulf Coast Joint Venture (GCJV)"}},{"name":"Stephen DeMaso","type":"Cooperator\/Partner","organization":{"displayText":"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and GCJV"}},{"name":"Barry Wilson","oldPartyId":11307,"type":"Cooperator\/Partner","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"GCJV"}},{"name":"South Central CSC","oldPartyId":59612,"type":"Funding Agency","contactType":"organization"}],"browseCategories":["Data","Project"],"browseTypes":["OGC WFS Layer","Downloadable","Map Service","OGC WMS Layer","Shapefile"],"systemTypes":["Folder","Downloadable","Mappable"],"tags":[{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"submersed aquatic vegetation"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Predictive modeling"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Climate Change"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"South Central Climate Science Center"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"FY 2012"},{"type":"Keyword","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Keyword","name":"Gulf of Mexico"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationType","name":"CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/OrganizationName","name":"South Central CSC"},{"type":"Label","scheme":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/vocab\/category\/NCCWSC\/Project\/FiscalYear","name":"2012"}],"dates":[{"type":"Start","dateString":"2012","label":"Start Date"},{"type":"End","dateString":"2015","label":"End Date"},{"type":"dateCreated","dateString":"2012-07-27T12:35:56.571-06:00","label":"Date Created"},{"type":"lastUpdated","dateString":"2014-12-04T16:35:24.983-07:00","label":"Last Updated"}],"facets":[{"projectStatus":"In Progress","facetName":"Project","className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"boundingBox":{"minY":28.118926400967,"minX":-96.982254642654,"maxY":30.47365301263,"maxX":-87.59722060087},"facetName":"Shapefile","name":"SAVProject_Boundary","files":[{"processed":false,"size":940,"dateUploaded":"2013-10-21T19:12:12.000Z","name":"SAVProject_Boundary.shp","pathOnDisk":"__disk__b9\/9f\/cc\/b99fcc3b683799460c498e030ffc5edd1c343bb2","contentType":"x-gis\/x-shapefile","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5012df8ce4b05140039e03c7?f=__disk__b9%2F9f%2Fcc%2Fb99fcc3b683799460c498e030ffc5edd1c343bb2"},{"processed":false,"size":127,"dateUploaded":"2013-10-21T19:12:12.000Z","name":"SAVProject_Boundary.dbf","pathOnDisk":"__disk__18\/63\/57\/1863571811891570030aa0e004340bb9159436ee","contentType":"application\/octet-stream","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5012df8ce4b05140039e03c7?f=__disk__18%2F63%2F57%2F1863571811891570030aa0e004340bb9159436ee"},{"processed":false,"size":108,"dateUploaded":"2013-10-21T19:12:12.000Z","name":"SAVProject_Boundary.shx","pathOnDisk":"__disk__ad\/53\/1d\/ad531d5b115862e010cd292464df2787ba5296b0","contentType":"x-gis\/x-shapefile","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/5012df8ce4b05140039e03c7?f=__disk__ad%2F53%2F1d%2Fad531d5b115862e010cd292464df2787ba5296b0"},{"processed":false,"size":425,"dateUploaded":"2013-10-21T19:12:12.000Z","name":"SAVProject_Boundary.prj","pathOnDisk":"__disk__2b\/d1\/d5\/2bd1d58939cf66bc6d4715ec175e4768bdd0ba4a","contentType":"text\/plain;

The Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test, a global-sensitivity algorithm, was implemented on a MWBM to generate parameter sensitivities on a set of 109\u202f951 hydrologic response units (HRUs) across the CONUS. The HRUs were grouped into 110 calibration regions based on similar parameter sensitivities. Subsequently, measured runoff from 1575 streamgages within the calibration regions were used to calibrate the MWBM parameters to produce parameter sets for each calibration region. Measured and simulated runoff at the 1575 streamgages showed good correspondence for the majority of the CONUS, with a median computed Nash\u2013Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0.76 over all streamgages. These methods maximize the use of available runoff information, resulting in a calibrated CONUS-wide application of the MWBM suitable for providing estimates of water availability at the HRU resolution for both gaged and ungaged areas of the CONUS.","parentId":"522540e2e4b0e4746d62afcd","contacts":[{"name":"Andy Bock","oldPartyId":929,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"abock@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Hydrologist","firstName":"Andy","lastName":"Bock","organization":{"displayText":"Colorado Water Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"3032364912","officePhone":"3032366875","streetAddress":{"zip":"80225","city":"Lakewood","state":"CO","line1":"W 6th Ave Kipling St"},"buildingCode":"KAH","name":"Andy Bock\/WRD\/CONT\/USGS\/DOI -

Two basins, the Verdigris River Basin (VRB) in the east and the Upper Washita Basin (UWB) in the west, with distinctive precipitation but similar vegetation and elevation, were selected to evaluate the TMPA products using rain gauge-blended products with WSR-88D NEXRAD Stage IV. This study sheds important insights into the detailed spatiotemporal precipitation errors, and also reveals algorithm performance during extreme events over the two low-relief basins within a high precipitation gradient zone. Based on nine years of measurements (2002 - 2010), this study shows that: (1) 3B42V7 corrects the widespread rainfall underestimation from research product 3B42V6, especially for the drier UWB with relative bias (RB) improvement from - 23.24% to 2.24%. (2) 3B42RTV7 reduces the widespread, notable overestimation from the real-time product 3B42RTV6, with minor overestimation in the wet VRB and underestimation in the dry UWB. (3) For both versions of TMPA products, larger root mean square error (RMSE) but higher correlation coefficients (CCs) tend to appear for the wet VRB, while lower RMSE and CC mostly occur in the dry UWB. 3B42RTV7 shows a drawback that the CC declines significantly, especially in the dry region where it drops below 0.5. (4) Seasonally, autumn rainfall estimations in both versions and basins have the least bias. The 3B42RTV6 overestimation and 3B42V6 underestimation of spring and summer rainfall, which dominate the annual total bias, are significantly reduced for both basins in the V7 products. Winter precipitation estimation improvement is also noticeable with significant RB and RMSE reductions. However, considerable overestimation in summer rainfall still exists for the wet basin. (5) Although V7 has the overall best performance, it still shows deficiency in detecting extreme rainfall events in low-relief regions, tending to underestimate peak rainfall intensity and to misrepresent timing and locations. Results from this study can be used for reference in the algorithm development of the next generation of Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) scheduled to launch in 2014.","parentId":"5225474ae4b0e4746d62b02f","contacts":[{"name":"Lei Qiao","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Oklahoma; National Weather Center; Oklahoma State University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Yang Hong","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Oklahoma; National Weather Center; Tsinghua University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Sheng Chen","type":"Author","contactType":"person","organization":{"displayText":"University of Oklahoma; National Weather Center"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Chris B.

In many semi-arid environments, woody plants face both fire and drought as recurring disturbances. Past work has demonstrated that oaks inhabiting sky-island forests of the northern Sierra Madre Oriental have differing microhabitat preferences and heavy stem dieback occured during the historic 2011 drought indicating potential xylem failure. These oak species, representing two sections within the genus, are all post-fire resprouters: they can resprout from underground storage organs when fire kills above ground tissue. Resprouts provide an opportunity to examine how functional traits may change as plastic responses to changing environmental conditions. Post-fire resprouts have increased root:shoot ratios relative to adults and therefore have access to more water relative to leaf demand. We expected that if resprouts exhibit plasticity in xylem function, they should favor water transport efficiency over safety: they should have higher maximum xylem conductivity, but greater susceptibility to drought-induced cavitation. We examined four oak species common in the Davis Mountains in west Texas and compared adult physiology with that of resprouts following wildfire. We found that species differed in degree of desiccation avoidance (isohydry) consistent with microhabitat preferences and that the species that were most desiccation tolerant as adults had resprouts significantly more susceptible to xylem cavitation. We found no evidence for a trade-off between efficiency and safety, however.","parentId":"52254315e4b0e4746d62afe9","contacts":[{"name":"Springer Netherlands","type":"Publisher","contactType":"organization","primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Dylan Schwilk","type":"Author","organization":{"displayText":"Texas Tech University"},"primaryLocation":{"streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":[]}},{"name":"Tailor E.

Black bear, bighorn sheep, mule deer, and wild turkey are just a few of the species found in these isolated mountain ecosystems that rise out of the desert landscape. However, recent droughts have crippled these ecosystems, causing significant tree death. Climate predictions suggest that this region will only face hotter and drier conditions in the future, potentially stressing these ecosystems even further. Simple models predict that vegetation will move to cooler and wetter locations in response to this warming. However, species responses will likely be more complex than these models show, as vegetation navigates other ecological stressors such as elevation change and water availability.<br>\n<br>\nIn order to better predict how vegetation will move in response to future warming, a more robust understanding of how drought and temperature impact tree survival is needed. Focusing on three Sky Island habitats in western Texas, this project will identify the key traits influencing current distributions of forest tree species, determine the susceptibility of these species to drought and temperature, and develop fine-scale, localized climate projections that model future conditions for the study area. This information will then be used to predict how species might shift location in response to warmer and drier future climates, enabling managers to make more robust decisions that will preserve Sky Island forests in the face of a changing climate.&nbsp;<\/div>\n","purpose":"The Sky Island forests of the southwestern United States comprise one of the most diverse temperate forest ecosystems in the world. These mountain ranges are key animal habitats and important stepping stones for migration. Drought has led to significant tree death throughout the southwest and climate predictions are that this region will face a hotter, more arid climate in the future. Simple models of plant response to warming climates predict vegetation moving to cooler and wetter locations (\u201cmarching upslope\u201d). However, the mechanisms explaining species-specific responses to changes in temperature and water availability are much more complex. Nighttime lows and daytime high temperatures may show contrasting elevational patterns and water availability does not uniformly increase with elevation. The nonlinearities in local microclimate signal the need to assess the interacting effects of drought and temperature on tree survival. To fill these current gaps in knowledge, project researchers propose to 1) identify the key traits influencing contemporary distributions of forest tree species in western Texas 2) collect micro-climate and soil moisture measurements and conduct fine-scale climate downscaling across three replicated mountain ranges that host important forest resources, and 3) use this information to predict how species might shift under future warmer and drier climates.","parentId":"52680a1ee4b0c24c90857576","contacts":[{"name":"Dylan Schwilk","type":"Principal

classification of hydraulic response to recharge in two karst aquifers","body":"Many karst aquifers are rapidly filled and depleted and therefore are likely to be susceptible to changes in short-term climate variability. Here we explore methods that could be applied to model site-specific hydraulic responses, with the intent of simulating these responses to different climate scenarios from high-resolution climate models. We compare hydraulic responses (spring flow, groundwater level, stream base flow, and cave drip) at several sites in two karst aquifers: the Edwards aquifer (Texas, USA) and the Madison aquifer (South Dakota, USA). A lumped-parameter model simulates nonlinear soil moisture changes for estimation of recharge, and a time-variant convolution model simulates the aquifer response to this recharge. Model fit to data is 2.4% better for calibration periods than for validation periods according to the Nash\u2013Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency, which ranges from 0.53 to 0.94 for validation periods. We use metrics that describe the shapes of the impulse-response functions (IRFs) obtained from convolution modeling to make comparisons in the distribution of response times among sites and between aquifers. Time-variant IRFs were applied to 62% of the sites. Principal component analysis (PCA) of metrics describing the shapes of the IRFs indicates three principal components that together account for 84% of the variability in IRF shape: the first is related to IRF skewness and temporal spread and accounts for 51% of the variability; the second and third largely are related to time-variant properties and together account for 33% of the variability. Sites with IRFs that dominantly comprise exponential curves are separated geographically from those dominantly comprising lognormal curves in both aquifers as a result of spatial heterogeneity. The use of multiple IRF metrics in PCA is a novel method to characterize, compare, and classify the way in which different sites and aquifers respond to recharge.

This information becomes even more important under a changing climate, as past conditions no longer serve as a reliable guide to the future. Our goal is to improve our understanding of basic climate science to meet regional stakeholder needs by quantifying uncertainty in precipitation variability and drought as a result of natural variability and human-induced change. Specifically, we aim to resolve the atmospheric and oceanic processes that bring moisture and precipitation into our region, and rigorously test the latest generation of global climate models to identify those capable of simulating the complex dynamics of precipitation across the South-Central region. The 3rd National Climate Assessment, demonstrates how precipitation projections for this region are notoriously uncertain; this analysis aims to narrow the range of uncertainty in future projections for precipitation and drought across the South-Central region, improving the relevance and reliability of climate projections for stakeholder planning. Results of the basic science analysis will be applied by the Southern Regional Climate Center (SRCC) to explore stakeholder informational needs related to precipitation variability, long-term forecasts, and climate projections. Lessons learned during these applications will be used to improve the value of climate science analyses provided by the SC-CSC and SRCC to ecological and human systems management throughout the region, and to\r\ndevelop products that fulfill regional needs for actionable climate information."}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Type","value":"Grant"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Number","value":"G15AP00137"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":288268,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":140429},{"year":"2016","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":147839}]}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/551ebfd5e4b027f0aee3b936?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/551ebfd5e4b027f0aee3b936?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=551ebfd5e4b027f0aee3b936&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=551ebfd5e4b027f0aee3b936&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=551ebfd5e4b027f0aee3b936&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=551ebfd5e4b027f0aee3b936","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/551ebfd5e4b027f0aee3b936\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/551ebfd5e4b027f0aee3b936","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"QuantifyingFutu.zip","files":""}],"csc":"South Central CSC","parent_id":"4f8c652fe4b0546c0c397b4a","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Jung-Hee Ryu","Sharmistha Swain","Luigi Romolo","Kevin Robbins","Barry Keim","Katharine Hayhoe","Amanda Lewis"],"orgs":["South Central CSC"],"funding_years":"2015","fy":"2015"},"551ec008e4b027f0aee3b948":{"relationships":{"total":0,"links":[]},"id":"551ec008e4b027f0aee3b948","title":"Regional Graduate Student and Early Career Researcher Training II","body":"<div>Investigating the complex natural and cultural resource management challenges we face today requires building diverse, interdisciplinary research teams.

I introduce the first version of RRAWFLOW available for download and public use and describe additional options. The open-source code is written in the R language and is available at http:\/\/sd.water.usgs.gov\/projects\/RRAWFLOW\/RRAWFLOW.html along with an example model of streamflow. RRAWFLOW includes a time-series process to estimate recharge from precipitation and simulates the response to recharge by convolution, i.e., the unit-hydrograph approach. Gamma functions are used for estimation of parametric impulse-response functions (IRFs); a combination of two gamma functions results in a double-peaked IRF. A spline fit to a set of control points is introduced as a new method for estimation of nonparametric IRFs. Several options are included to simulate time-variant systems. For many applications, lumped models simulate the system response with equal accuracy to that of distributed models, but moreover, the ease of model construction and calibration of lumped models makes them a good choice for many applications (e.g., estimating missing periods in a hydrologic record). RRAWFLOW provides professional hydrologists and students with an accessible and versatile tool for lumped-parameter modeling.<\/p>","parentId":"4f4e4771e4b07f02db47e1e4","linkParentIds":["52d563cbe4b0f19e63da8658"],"contacts":[{"name":"Andrew J.

Soil moisture is the central variable by which agricultural drought is defined, and soil moisture mediates the relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought; yet, none of the widely used drought indices incorporate measurements of soil moisture. The objective of this project is to build the necessary scientific foundation for soil moisture-based drought monitoring in the South Central region and beyond. Background. The exclusion of soil moisture data was unavoidable in 1965 when Palmer developed his seminal drought severity index, but times have changed. Extensive monitoring systems operated by state and federal agencies now provide real-time soil moisture data across the US. For example, the Texas A&M North American Soil Moisture Database (NASMD) houses soil moisture data for more than 1,400 sites in the North America. These new resources create unprecedented opportunities for improved drought monitoring, but there are several key challenges which currently prevent full utilization of soil moisture data for drought monitoring. Procedures\/Methods. We propose to develop readily understandable, scientifically sound, soil moisture-based drought indices for the South Central region using in situ data from the Oklahoma Mesonet and West Texas Mesonet. The most promising indices will be identified based on relationships with existing wildfire data, a SC CSC science priority, and county-level crop yield data, which are important for land management decisions and are also proxy indicators for net primary productivity and wildlife habitat quality in natural ecosystems. In parallel, we also propose to create a harmonized soil moisture dataset for the South Central region by developing and applying best practices for inter-network soil moisture data harmonization. This harmonized dataset is essential for subsequent regional-scale applications of project outcomes to inform management decisions. Expected Products and Information\/Technology Transfer. At the completion of this project, we will have developed effective soil moisture-based drought indices which can be used retrospectively or in real-time with data from existing monitoring networks in the South Central region or across the US. We will also have created a unique, harmonized regional soil moisture database which will facilitate a wide variety of subsequent climate-related research efforts. The results of this project will be incorporated in the pilot soil moisture portal that is being developed by USGS and TAMU and will be made available operationally. Personnel\/Cooperators\/Partners. The project team is well qualified to succeed as evidenced by strong achievement records in soil moisture and drought related research. The team will partner with USGS-CIDA, the SCIPP RISA, and the Oklahoma Mesonet to extend the resulting products to end-users."}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet"},{"facetName":"Budget","parts":[{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Type","value":"Grant"},{"_class":"BudgetPart","type":"Agreement Number","value":"G15AP00151"}],"className":"gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet","totalFunds":45857,"annualBudgets":[{"year":"2015","_class":"AnnualBudget","totalFunds":45857}]}],"distributionLinks":[{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/551ebff1e4b027f0aee3b93f?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint","title":"KML Service","type":"kml","typeLabel":"KML Download","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalogMaps\/mapping\/ows\/551ebff1e4b027f0aee3b93f?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0","title":"ScienceBase WMS Service","type":"serviceCapabilitiesUrl","typeLabel":"OGC Service Capabilities URL","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=551ebff1e4b027f0aee3b93f&format=json","title":"ScienceBase Collection JSON","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=551ebff1e4b027f0aee3b93f&format=atom","title":"ScienceBase Collection ATOM","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/items?parentId=551ebff1e4b027f0aee3b93f&format=csv","title":"ScienceBase Collection CSV","type":"repo","typeLabel":"ScienceBase Repository","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=551ebff1e4b027f0aee3b93f","title":"ScienceBase OAI PMH Service","type":"oai-pmh","typeLabel":"OAI-PMH","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/551ebff1e4b027f0aee3b93f\/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords","title":"ScienceBase CSW Service","type":"csw","typeLabel":"","rel":"alternate","name":"","files":""},{"uri":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/file\/get\/551ebff1e4b027f0aee3b93f","title":"Download Attached Files","type":"downloadLink","typeLabel":"Download Link","rel":"alternate","name":"SoilMoisture_Ba.zip","files":""}],"csc":"South Central CSC","parent_id":"4f8c652fe4b0546c0c397b4a","projectStatus":"In Progress","people":["Tyson Ochsner","Steven Quiring","Erik Krueger","Jessica M Lucido","Chad McNutt","James P Verdin","Mark Shafer"],"orgs":["South Central CSC"],"funding_years":"2015","fy":"2015"},"5797aa9ce4b0858db36ef6d2":{"relationships":{"total":2,"links":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/521cf67ce4b01458f7858040","rel":"product of","relatedRel":"produced","title":"Statistically downscaled estimates of precipitation and temperature for the Red River basin (South Central U.S.A) Downscaled Future Projections","relatedTitle":"Impacts of Climate Change on Flows in the Red River Basin","id":"5797aa9ce4b0858db36ef6d2","relatedId":"521cf67ce4b01458f7858040","annotation":null},{"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencebase.gov\/catalog\/item\/5797aa9ce4b0858db36ef6d2","rel":"produced","relatedRel":"product of","title":"Impacts of Climate Change on Flows in the Red River Basin","relatedTitle":"Statistically downscaled estimates of precipitation and temperature for the Red River basin (South Central U.S.A) Downscaled Future Projections","id":"521cf67ce4b01458f7858040","relatedId":"5797aa9ce4b0858db36ef6d2","annotation":null}]},"id":"5797aa9ce4b0858db36ef6d2","title":"Statistically downscaled estimates of precipitation and temperature for the Red River basin (South Central U.S.A) Downscaled Future Projections","body":"This collection contains three statistically downscaled time series (datasets) for the Red River Basin (South Central U.S.), and one dataset used as historical observations.

The objective of this project is to synthesize and evaluate prevailing hydrological and ecological models in the South-Central U.S., particularly the southern Great Plains region. This analysis will identify the data requirements and suitability of each model to simulate stream flow while addressing associated changes in the ecology of stream systems, and will portray climate variability and uncertainty. The anticipated results and deliverables of this project will include a comprehensive, updated, and systematic report on recent developments in ecosystem hydrology with a focus on freshwater resource management. This synthesis report will directly address existing needs of the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) by providing information that can be readily used to help understand the effect of climate change and land management on hydrology and associated fish communities.<\/p>\n","parentId":"5006f8b9e4b0abf7ce733fc0","contacts":[{"name":"Shannon K Brewer","oldPartyId":23090,"type":"Principal Investigator","contactType":"person","email":"skbrewer@usgs.gov","jobTitle":"Assistant Unit Leader, Research Fish Biologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"Shannon","middleName":"K","lastName":"Brewer","organization":{"displayText":"Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit"},"primaryLocation":{"faxPhone":"4057445006","officePhone":"4057449841","streetAddress":{"zip":"74078","city":"Stillwater","state":"OK","line1":"007 Agriculture Hall"},"buildingCode":"KHC","name":"Shannon K Brewer\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI - Primary Location","mailAddress":{"zip":"74078-0611","country":"USA","city":"Stillwater","state":"OK","line1":"007 Agriculture Hall"},"building":"CRU COOP - OK FWRU - Agriculture Hall"}},{"name":"Chris B.

United States: Implications for the Sustainability of Wildlife Populations and Communities","body":"<p>Connectivity, or the extent to which a landscape facilitates or impedes the movement of organisms, is an important component of the sustainability of wildlife populations and communities. Habitat fragmentation, modification, and loss have been implicated in the decline of almost all threatened and endangered species, and both continued land-use change and climate change will have an effect on habitats. The goal of this project is to use a systematic and comprehensive approach to evaluate terrestrial connectivity across the South Central United States. Models will be used to predict patterns of connectivity for species which vary in habitat preferences, methods of habitat selection, and responses to the area between habitats. Researchers will evaluate the implications of predicted land-use change across the study area, including a focus on climate change and dominant land uses within the region. The results of this project will include spatially explicit connectivity maps that can be used for making informed management decisions about terrestrial connectivity within this region.<\/p>\n","parentId":"5006f8b9e4b0abf7ce733fc0","contacts":[{"name":"Kristen A.

In this project, we used this zone of remarkable transition to develop macroclimate-based models for quantifying the regional responses of coastal wetland ecosystems to climate variation. In addition to providing important fish and wildlife habitat and supporting coastal food webs, these coastal wetlands provide many ecosystem goods and services including clean water, stable coastlines, food, recreational opportunities, and stored carbon. Our objective was to examine and forecast the effects of macroclimatic drivers on wetland ecosystem structure and function in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Our first major step in meeting this overall objective was to develop a quantitative understanding of the connections between climate and ecosystem structure. We then incorporated the resulting information into quantitative vulnerability assessments that examine sensitivity (via observed data), exposure (via alternative future climate scenarios), and adaptive capacity (via life history literature). In the process, we identified regional climate-ecological thresholds for coastal wetland ecosystems. Our study focused on coastal wetland variations across relatively dramatic precipitation and temperature gradients in the northern Gulf of Mexico and included study areas in TX, LA, MS, AL, and FL. The project provided valuable experience and opportunities for five early-career researchers (one post-doctoral fellow, two current or recent undergraduate students, and two early-career research scientists).&nbsp;\n<br> &nbsp;","purpose":"Examine and forecast the effects of macroclimatic drivers on wetland ecosystem structure and function in the northern Gulf of Mexico","parentId":"52254427e4b0e4746d62aff9","linkParentIds":["5786b374e4b0e02680c2ceec"],"contacts":[{"name":"Michael J Osland","oldPartyId":57822,"type":"Author","contactType":"person","email":"mosland@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","firstName":"Michael","middleName":"J","lastName":"Osland","organization":{"displayText":"National Wetlands Research Center"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"3372668664","streetAddress":{"zip":"70506","city":"Lafayette","state":"LA","line1":"700 Cajundome Blvd"},"buildingCode":"KFA","name":"Michael J Osland\/BRD\/USGS\/DOI -

Overall, planning agencies, stakeholders, hydrological modelers, ecologists, biologists and economists, among many others, will benefit from knowing the sensitivities of the downscaling methods to these sources of uncertainty, as analyzing the differences among the 243 projections will provide valuable information regarding the level of confidence we should attribute to the local scale climate projections.","parentId":"55130c66e4b02e76d75c0758","contacts":[{"name":"Carlos F.

Future species ranges and fire frequencies will be joined to describe changes in ecosystems, fire, and desertification effects. Background: This proposal directly addresses the SC CSC over-arching theme of precipitation variability and specifically responds to two suggested examples under Priority 2d, Ecosystems and Landscapes: \u201cWhere will woody plants reside in 2050, and how will fire regimes change, using an existing fire regime model (e.g., Guyette et al 2012. Predicting fire frequency with chemistry and climate. Ecosystems 15(2): 322-335) paired with existing climate projection models to develop maps of projected change.\u201d The two lead authors on the RFP-referenced paper (Guyette and Stambaugh) are investigators on this project. They developed the Physical Chemistry Fire Frequency Model (PC2FM) to estimate fire frequency from temperature and precipitation inputs, which are independent of non-climatic influences such as changes in vegetation, ignition sources, and land use. Methods: Future annual precipitation and temperature means derived from various climate models will be used as inputs to the PC2FM model to predict the future climate-forced fire frequencies. We will use model output to quantify past to future changes in fire frequency and the conditions and locations of desertification. Spatial analysis will combine future changes in fire frequencies with potential future distributions of southwest ecosystems and select woody species for mid and late 21st century. Expected Products and Tech Transfer: Products will include 1) maps of future changes in fire frequency at the level of 12 km2 2) maps future ranges of selected woody species and ecosystems based on climate and climate-driven fire probability and 3) at least 2 peer-reviewed papers.

However, natural variability of Earth\u2019s climate system can degrade capabilities for identifying climate trends. Here we produced a long-term (1982\u20132013) remote sensing based land ET record and investigated multidecadal changes in global ET and underlying causes.

These potential changes in climate will adversely affect habitats, ecosystems, and landscapes as well as the fish and wildlife they support. But while today\u2019s global climate models (GCMs) provide generally accurate, large-scale projections, local predictions are notoriously imprecise, and impede proper, long-term mitigation planning. To address these challenges, this research will take a collaborative multi-organization approach that leverages the expertise of the University of Oklahoma, Department of Interior South Central Climate Science Center, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This research uses high resolution weather models to downscale GCM forecasts to provide more accurate local projections. This work will create multiple model runs (called an \u201censemble\u201d) to provide uncertainty associated with the climate projections. Research activities will consist of the application of hydrological products from very high-resolution regional climate projections to guide real-world, long-term collaborative water management planning relevant to local, tribal, state and federal government decision making. High-resolution model output will be used to advance planning in flood control, water supply management, hydroelectric power generation, and ecosystem conservation.","parentId":"55130c66e4b02e76d75c0758","contacts":[{"name":"Ming Xue","type":"Principal Investigator","highlighted":true,"contactType":"person","email":"mxue@ou.edu","organization":{"displayText":"Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms (CAPS), University of Oklahoma"},"primaryLocation":{"officePhone":"405-325-6037","streetAddress":[],"mailAddress":{"zip":"73072","country":"null","city":"Norman","state":"Oklahoma","line1":"Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms,\r\nUniversity of Oklahoma\r\nNWC Suite 2500\r\n120 David L.

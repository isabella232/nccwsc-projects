The resampling was done using a majority filter so that cells in the new raster represent the most common type from the original raster. The main use for this dataset is in conjunction with Southwest Forest Vulnerability Index rasters, which contain the modeled vegetation exposure scores for several projected future climate scenarios. This raster can be used as an index of the vegetation type being modeled at each location.","type":["Data"]},"222":{"id":"5447c244e4b0f888a81b8378","csc":"Southwest CSC","title":"Year-round Migrations of the Cui-ui and Lahontan Cutthroat Trout in Pyramid Lake","body":"This presentation provides an overview of the year-round migrations of the Cui-ui and Lahontan cutthroat trout within Pyramid Lake.
